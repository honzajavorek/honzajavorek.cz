Elvis, a Zimbabwean, a Jew, an Italian from the Netherlands, a [Peace Corps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_Corps) volunteer, a Namibian [PSF Fellow](https://www.python.org/psf/fellows/), and a Czech walk out of their cars to the oldest and driest desert in the world. You know, just to have a little stretch after a 300 km long drive, and to take a few pictures. No, that's not a beginning of an overly complicated joke. That's what can happen to you as an attendee of the [PyCon Namibia](https://na.pycon.org/).

To understand why these people are driving 700 km straight through the Namib desert to visit the town [LÃ¼deritz](https://goo.gl/maps/73NeuU7dVTWxaYo19), an isolated place surrounded by endless sand dunes from one side, and the vast Atlantic ocean from the other side, we need to go back to 2017.
