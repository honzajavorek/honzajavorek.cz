How to learn something new when you don't know anything about it? One often-overlooked option is **learning by organizing**. People think they can't organize events if they don't know anything about the topic of the events, but my life experience proves this isn't true. Actually, I think I'm a sufficient proof that to learn by organizing, you don't need to be good even at organizing.

## Learning by organizing a meetup

In 2009 I was already proficient in HTML, CSS, and PHP 5. However, over time I got tired by PHP and I developed a desire to learn a different programming language. For some reason, out of all the options available, I started to be attracted to Python. To be attracted to something and to be learning something are two different things though. I was busy with university courses, student parties, and random gigs as a freelance web developer. In 2011, my progress with Python was just a tiny bit more than zero.

That year I saw a tweet by [my friend](https://twitter.com/svecmichal) about attending a local Ruby meetup. I thought: "Wow! I don't know what a meetup is, but it sounds cool and I'd definitely come to one about Python!" I asked my Twitter whether there's something like that in my town, but the collective answer was that no, there's no local Python group. One answer was different though: "There's no local Python group, so go and start one!" Naturally, I replied I don't know anything about Python, so I can't start a local meetup about it. But [the person](https://twitter.com/milancermak) insisted: "You don't need to know anything about the topic as an organizer, right? You set up the place and just make sure the event happens." After some thinking I had to admit he's right! As an organizer, my job is to find a table in a pub, make a reservation, create a Facebook Event, invite friends, attend, listen, repeat. So I did that.

26th of April, 2011, the first Python meetup in [Brno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brno) took place. As far as I remember, there were eight attendees. We passionately talked for several hours - about everything but Python. It was awesome and since that day, there are monthly Python meetups in Brno.

### BYO speakers

A common way meetups get formed is around a few individuals who know a lot about the topic and want to share their enthusiasm with others. They usually spend the first months or even years not only organizing, but also giving the majority of the talks at the events, because they're the only ones knowledgeable enough. I couldn't do that! I knew nothing of any value. If I wanted my events to have talks, I had to find speakers.

I didn't give a talk at the meetup until 2012. Even that one was an exception. It was an intro talk about [Celery](https://docs.celeryproject.org/) and distributed task queues in general. When I finished, all shaky, someone from the audience asked me something like: "Is that all? I came here to learn about advanced usage of Celery, this is just the basics." :) (But otherwise the meetup gave me a safe space where I could grow as a speaker and improve.)

### Extras earned

I couldn't show off my knowledge, so I focused on designing the evening, networking, promoting the events on social media, and so on. This gave me a lot of experience in fields I never anticipated I could be experienced in. My portfolio of soft skills is a lot more diverse than the one of a regular developer.

I'm an introvert by default and by organizing I got much better in communication. Nobody asked me whether I like to call pubs to make reservations, it simply had to be done, so I got it done.

I made a lot of organizing mistakes, but it was good enough to keep the show going. It was volunteering, after all, and people were glad that the meetup exists at all. That there's a person who's doing all the organizing for them. Pro tip: Spin the story so people perceive your mistakes as an inseparable part of how home-made and honest the event organization is ;)

I think I improved in organizing over time, but I've seen people who're a lot more skillful than me and it costs them a lot less stress, so if I can, I leave organizing to them. Together with my wife, we managed to organize our 50+ people wedding, and I think it was a good party, so there's still some skill left in me, but I keep it only as a backup if there are no real event managers around.

### Mission accomplished

The most important thing though, over time I got better in Python! Although in the beginning I couldn't dedicate much time to practicing, I regularly dedicated the whole evening per month to listening. I've seen all the talks, tips, and tricks.

(Also, from 2013 to 2015 we actually merged with the local Ruby user group which originally sparked my interest, so I've seen a lot of Ruby talks, too. Until this day I've written about 5 lines of Ruby total, but I've seen so many talks about various Ruby libraries that it happened to me many times in conversations I recommended some of them to actual Ruby developers.)

I started a meetup because I wanted to learn a topic. In the beginning, I didn't know anything about it. I had to bring my own speakers, but somehow it worked out. I've got a lot of knowledge from the talks, I've got a lot of advice from the folks, and I've become a Python meetup organizer, which opened many doors for me, regardless of my actual Python knowledge. Over time I was able to take more and more gigs in Python instead of PHP, and at some point I abandoned PHP altogether, relying solely on my Python knowledge to earn my living.

## Learning by organizing a course

In the Czech Republic there are several [PyLadies](https://pyladies.com/) chapters. Traditionally, each of them organizes a semester-long evening coding course for beginners. It's ran by volunteers and it's free of charge for the students.

Intentionally, the roles between lecturers and organizers of the course are split. Why? Because anybody can be the organizer. You don't need to know how to code to organize a coding course. You need to be able to communicate and manage one or two Excel sheets. This not only allows the course alumni to give back to the community and become organizers, but it also enables people to start their own courses. (Of course, it helps that the [teaching materials are Open Source](https://github.com/pyvec/naucse.python.cz/) and publicly available.)

The seats at "official" PyLadies courses are limited, so there's an application process. It happened multiple times that someone didn't make it, but was proactive and got a seat by volunteering help with the organization of the course. Others even started their own runs. One year there was around 20 people over the limit, so they self-organized and started a parallel course with just a little help from the "official" organizers. They had to bring their own lecturers, but they managed to find them and it worked out. Once or twice the applicants who weren't accepted decided they'll start private runs with their colleagues, after work, in their company. And it's not just about courses. Many one-day workshops started around someone who just wanted to know more about the topic, found a volunteer lecturer, and organized a Saturday event where also other beginners could come. (Of course, it helps the folks from the local PyLadies chapter can provide tips on companies to host the event, has a [nonprofit](https://pyvec.org/) to pay invoices, and so on.)

## Try it!

I've seen it many times, it works. You don't have to know anything about the topic, it's no obstacle in organizing an event or a series of events, and it's gonna help you to eventually learn the topic. On top of that, you'll get a lot of extra skills, contacts, your name will be known in the community, and other fun.

Depending on the current COVID-19 situation in your country, you might not find this advice very useful, but I think it has been proved already many times that events can thrive in their online forms too, it's just a slightly different experience from both the organizers' and attendees' perspectives. Think of the opportunities! It could be difficult to get a Django core committer speaking at your local meetup in [Windhoek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windhoek), but if you can ensure reliable internet connection, this is now very well possible.

It's an amazing conference and a lovely, hardworking community. One of the things they do is they're trying to set up computer labs for children to learn to code.
