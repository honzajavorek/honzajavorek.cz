I see &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evildmp"&gt;Daniele Procida&lt;/a&gt; talking about the &lt;a href="https://africa.python.org/"&gt;Python Africa&lt;/a&gt; website and about &lt;a href="https://na.pycon.org/"&gt;PyCon Namibia&lt;/a&gt;. The seed has been planted to my head. Since then, I dreamed of visiting PyCon Namibia one day. In 2020, just before all the …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's 2017 and I'm at the &lt;a href="https://www.writethedocs.org/"&gt;Write the Docs&lt;/a&gt; conference in Prague. I see &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evildmp"&gt;Daniele Procida&lt;/a&gt; talking about the &lt;a href="https://africa.python.org/"&gt;Python Africa&lt;/a&gt; website and about &lt;a href="https://na.pycon.org/"&gt;PyCon Namibia&lt;/a&gt;. The seed has been planted to my head. Since then, I dreamed of visiting PyCon Namibia one day. In 2020, just before all the COVID-19 mayhem has started, a friend pushed me over the edge. We took our backpacks and spent February 2020 among some awesome people, within the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=namibia"&gt;breathtaking nature of Namibian deserts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I returned back, I was full of ideas on how to collaborate with the Namibian Python community. We thought about inviting some speakers from Namibia to &lt;a href="https://cz.pycon.org/"&gt;PyCon CZ&lt;/a&gt; that year, and other things. I wanted to write down an article about our journey, describe the amazing things we've seen, and first of all, the kind and good-hearted people we've met. But then, the pandemic has destroyed it all and took all my energy away. After more than a year, just a few days before the PyCon Namibia 2021 starts, I at least managed to get finished a quick interview with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JessicaUpani"&gt;Jessica Upani&lt;/a&gt;, the president of the &lt;a href="https://pynamibia.herokuapp.com/"&gt;PyNam&lt;/a&gt; (Python programming society of Namibia).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="me, Jessica, and my friend" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/jessica-and-us.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
Me, Jessica, and my friend at PyCon NA 2020&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this interview we talk about her beginnings, the programming community in Namibia, possible future for Namibian scholars, and about the hardships of organizing community events in a Southern-African country, especially in the time of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Before you immerse into reading the interview, let me just quickly remind that &lt;a href="https://na.pycon.org/"&gt;PyCon NA 2021&lt;/a&gt; takes place online, starting tomorrow - that is 18th-19th June. The standard &lt;a href="https://na.pycon.org/tickets/"&gt;ticket&lt;/a&gt; is 640 CZK/29 USD/400 NAD, and it has a &lt;a href="https://na.pycon.org/programme/"&gt;one-track two-day programme&lt;/a&gt; with talks about wide range of Python topics and speakers from all around the world. You can also follow the conference at &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pyconna"&gt;@PyConNA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jessica, I know you’re one of the driving forces behind the growth and success of the Python community in Namibia. I know you especially as a co-organizer of &lt;a href="https://na.pycon.org/2020/"&gt;PyCon NA 2020&lt;/a&gt;, together with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/muheuenga"&gt;Ngazetungue Muheue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evildmp"&gt;Daniele Procida&lt;/a&gt;, and others, but I came across many clues that in fact you’re doing much more than “just” the conference. Could you list all the activities you’re participating in?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, we do more than just the conference. The conference is just one of the activities that we do to help grow the community. In fact, it is our biggest event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We do school outreach programs to help get more scholars to join the community through coding clubs and to raise awareness of Computer Science related courses to high school learners.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We run workshops and trainings that help us build skills within the community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We also run meetups to help keep the community together and host talks on different Python/Django related topics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes we also collaborate with other community leaders on their events or we attend them and are given a few minutes to introduce the Python community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you personally get to programming and to participation in the programming community? Would you describe your history a bit?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My journey started in 2016 when I attended the first ever Python conference in Namibia organized by Daniele Procida, Vincent Knight and others, with the assistance of the &lt;a href="https://www.unam.edu.na/"&gt;University of Namibia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/"&gt;Cardiff University&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/phoenix-project"&gt;Phoenix Project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attended the conference, because it was free, and hence it meant free food, and the conference was just a few days before my classes started, so I had time. I was certainly not there for Python, because I had heard the worst about Python prior to the conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved the community and the friends I made during the conference, and I was sold by the end of the 4 days. I wanted to give the experience I just had with more people. During the course of the conference, there was a talk about starting a society that would carry out the work of building the community after the conference. I joined and never looked back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="Jessica Upani" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/jessica-upani-ewa-jodlowska.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;During PyCon NA 2020, I remember you saying that you plan to start a PyLadies group, and I remember there was already a group for students, PyNam Scholars. But now when I check &lt;a href="https://pynamibia.herokuapp.com/group/"&gt;your community website&lt;/a&gt;, there are now seven different user groups! How did this happen? Does it mean the community is growing and more and more people are participating?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not necessarily. It means that we have evolved and thought of different ways that we could cater for the different interest areas that our community may have. We started the subgroups to get more people from the community to help us manage the subgroups and for there to be more focused workshops and trainings. PyNam Scholars and PyLadies have both had events but the rest still need collaborative effort to get more done. We are very hopeful that each one of these subgroups will take their own paths and will impact the community at their different levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="Jessica and friends" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/jessica-scholars.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
Jessica and scholars&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If I’m allowed to dream, Namibians could learn programming and either start cool local technological businesses, or get remote jobs as professionals to hire. I don’t believe any of the thousands of Silicon Valley projects will ever solve a single African problem, but it might take just a single mobile app made by Namibians. Also, unlike us, you could actually skip building dirty factories all over your country and get right to the Finnish way of doing things: not many people, not many resources, but very smart. Is this a completely crazy idea? What do you think are the possibilities of programming in Namibia? I’m asking about an idealistic, visionary view, which you wish could happen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ha ha…! That is a thought provoking question. That is exactly what we hope for with all the efforts that we put into skill development. Namibians are so smart and capable. They are capable of just as much as any other developer is capable of from any part of the world, with the right amount of exposure and resources. There have been such amazingly creative projects that I have witnessed since I joined the community. There is still a lot more that needs to be done but I am so hopeful for the Namibian community. I foresee a lot more Open Source startups and much stronger developers as time progresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now if we get back our feet to the sandy Namibian ground, what do you think are the biggest obstacles which prevent you from achieving your goals? It can be personal or systematic, whatever is holding you back the most.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are core issues such as a lack of exposure and a lack of resources within our community. But there are a lot of key players in this journey that still need to work together and recognise their role in the success of the future generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have parents at home who may not see the importance of their child having a computer (or exposure to one) or for the child to attend developer events for example. Some parents would still stop a girl child from owning a computer or attending a developer event but would provide those exact opportunities to their boy child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a great role that the government has to play in terms of policy making, increasing the standard of the adopted curriculum in schools, functional resources at schools, skill development of teachers, and so much more. Universities have their role to play and organizations within the country, either private or otherwise, also need to be willing to invest in tech. The list is endless Honza, I could talk all day about this but we are taking baby steps to help steer our community in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m looking forward to &lt;a href="https://na.pycon.org/"&gt;PyCon NA 2021&lt;/a&gt;. Usually it used to be in February, but this year I noticed that it is in June. I suppose that’s because of the pandemic. How would you describe the impact of the pandemic on your activities?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are scared of hosting the conference online. Connection issues, a lack of resources of our community as well as the affordability of the data to attend the conference are the main concerns. This has been a big issue in our online workshops and hence I'm afraid that it will shy many people from benefiting from the conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our community is also very small and hence we relied on events such as the conference to gather as many of our community members as possible and motivate them to push themselves even more. The pandemic has changed it all and we are comfortable with letting it be and keeping everyone safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference was pushed because we wanted to have an in-person conference so much. There was such a long drag because most of us were so against an online conference. We didn't even know if the conference would take place at all this year, I'm surprised that the conference is now just a few days away. It is a miracle!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="PyCon NA 2020" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/jessica-elvis.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
Jessica Upani introduces &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ElvisZokora"&gt;Elvis Zokora&lt;/a&gt; from Côte d'Ivoire at last year's PyCon NA&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think the conference will run both in person and online, for the first time in history. Could you describe the pros and cons of this decision? Are there any difficulties to overcome?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference is fully online. In the past few weeks, Namibia has experienced a spike in COVID-19 cases from about 200 cases a day to up to 1400 cases a day. The country is now in lockdown in some areas and hence we are not able to meet in person at all. Right now we have just accepted the situation for what it is and go ahead with the conference either way despite the challenges that may be experienced by especially the attendees from Namibia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I'm sorry to hear that :( Crossing fingers it all gets better. When the pandemic hit the Czech Republic, many people here were surprised by the fact that not every child has a computer, not every child has access to the internet. There were &lt;a href="https://www.ucimeonline.cz/aktivity/sbirka-pocitacu/"&gt;fund-raising campaigns&lt;/a&gt; for getting computers to children from low-income families, so they could connect to school online and continue their education. At that time I recalled how your Patreon page &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/pythonnamibia"&gt;patreon.com/pythonnamibia&lt;/a&gt; started. Could you tell us more about the fund-raising, where does the money go and what it enables?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The page is our attempt at creating computer labs in schools. It was created in 2018, during which it didn't make any income. By 2019 we slowly progressed to 30 USD a month. The most growth was only made in 2020-2021. In total we just about reached 2000 USD. This is an accumulation of since we started in 2018 and hence we have not yet withdrawn the amount. In Namibia, a new computer costs 500 USD minimum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we are working on getting more people or organizations to join us, and add to this amount, so that we are finally able to buy computers for one school at a time. This may not have a very large impact but we believe that it is better than doing nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are so grateful to everyone who has supported our Patreon page so far without having any evidence that we will indeed do as we say, but with mere faith that this is a good course, and it will benefit African children who will otherwise not be able to use a computer. We are very grateful and proud of our supporters, who have joined in doing something about this big fight that Africans keep fighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope that everyone reading this will find it in their heart to join us and support the course. Only together can we create a bigger impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="PyNam Scholars" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/pynam-scholars.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
Namibian scholars&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I suppose PyCon NA is the project which now requires the most of your attention and energy, but when it’s over, what is the number one thing you want to focus on?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After PyCon NA 2021, we have a couple of workshops and meetups planned. But more importantly, we have a school outreach that will happen soon after the conference, in which we hope to get more scholars to join in our Python training that will take place over 12 Saturdays. We will continue working for the community to help build coding skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone would like to reach out to us as a speaker, workshop organizer or any other collaboration, we are very open to that. Please, just write to &lt;a href="https://pynamibia.herokuapp.com/"&gt;PyNam&lt;/a&gt; or directly to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does your community work? Could you describe how it’s structured, how does it organize itself? Is there some hierarchy, semi-official roles, org meetings, communication channels?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow. That has been a complicated process! I lead the team, but I am part of an executive team of more than 10 people who oversee the operations of the different subgroups. Every operational subgroup has a lead. Even though the number sounds big enough, that has not reflected on the amount of work that is done in the society. So we are still working on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is my dream to have less to do one day :) PyCon Namibia however is run solely by volunteers both from the Namibian community as well as the international community, and a few PyNam executives, who are willing to volunteer. So everyone and anyone is welcome to join the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a WhatsApp group for coordination, and we use Microsoft Teams for the online events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="Jessica Upani" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/jessica-pynam.jpg"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What advice would you give to a person in a similar position to yours, i.e. local community leader, who is working hard to make their user group grow? Perhaps someone from Maputo, Hradec Králové or Harare is reading this. Is there something which worked for you well and you think it might work well elsewhere, too?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, awesome question which I love to talk about all the time. I would say just get started, if you haven't done so already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This question has so many layers, Honza. In my journey there have been so many things that have been involved, and that I have learned from. If I can pick a direction in which to answer, this is in terms of the characters of the person/s starting this journey, because that's the most important one in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to be pure in terms of your why. Your why should be selfless, should never give up and should be willing to sacrifice one's personal gains for the good of the community. Know what you want to accomplish overall, and then take one step at a time that will lead you in that direction. Do not be overly concerned about the successes of other communities, rather aim to understand your type of community and strive to navigate through that to reach your overall mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You do not need to have it all together in terms of coding skills for you to start, you just need the will to work for your community without gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And maybe, if you don't do it, no one else will. Just get started, the rest will work itself out, one step at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I can't imagine a better closing. I know you're quite busy these days and I didn't really get in touch in good time, so thank you very much Jessica, that in the end, you were able to carve out a bit of time to answer these questions. Fingers crossed with organizing the conference, I'm sure it's gonna be awesome!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's super late, but you poked my mind in such a thought provoking way! It was nice to reflect on the past and the future. Thanks, Honza!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category></entry><entry><title>Týdenní poznámky #54: Očkování</title><link href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/tydenni-poznamky-54-ockovani/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-06-11T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2021-06-11T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Honza Javorek</name></author><id>tag:honzajavorek.cz,2021-06-11:/blog/tydenni-poznamky-54-ockovani/</id><summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utekl další týden (7.6. — 11.6.) a tak &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/tydenni-poznamky-53-jaro/"&gt;stejně jako minule&lt;/a&gt; sepisuji, co jsem dělal a co zajímavého jsem se naučil.

&lt;p&gt;Jak jsem psal, dělám spolu s Engetem na speciálních společných materiálech. V pondělí to má termín, takže jsem se tento týden snažil vše dokončovat a zabralo mi to většinu času.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Výsledek bude něco, co se bude nacházet jak na jejich webu, tak na mojem. Benefitovat z toho bude moci široká veřejnost, takže win win, dost se na to těším. A jsem zvědavý, jak to dopadne, jak to nakonec bude vypadat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zpracovani-sponzoru"&gt;Zpracování sponzorů&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#zpracovani-sponzoru" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Už minulý týden jsem si udělal tabulku sponzorů a aktualizoval všechny dohody, které jsem uzavřel. Uprostřed tohoto týdne jsem si potřeboval odopočinout od veškeré administrativní práce a od psaní materiálů, tak jsem naprogramoval skript, který sponzorům přidělí v klubu sponzorskou roli. Taky se teď loga na stránce klubu vypisují z databáze, resp. z té Google Sheets tabulky, a nejsou natvrdo v HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="favicon-pritom-takova-blbost"&gt;Favicon: Přitom taková blbost!&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#favicon-pritom-takova-blbost" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U nabídek práce, kde chybí logo firmy, stahuji favicon aj. obrázky z webu firmy. Byl to před časem takový zběsilý nápad, ale ve výsledku to funguje až překvapivě dobře. Blbé je, že knihovna &lt;a href="https://github.com/scottwernervt/favicon"&gt;favicon&lt;/a&gt; vrátí někdy spoustu ikonek a obrázků a &lt;a href="https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/media-pipeline.html"&gt;scrapy pipeline&lt;/a&gt;, která loga pak zpracovává, je nebyla schopna nějak dobře seřadit a vybrat ten nejlepší, takže se občas na webu objevil jako logo firmy úplně nesmyslný obrázek. Třeba &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/profiles/rh/themes/redhatdotcom/img/red-hat-social-share.jpg"&gt;tenhle&lt;/a&gt; místo &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/misc/favicon.ico"&gt;tohoto&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Štvalo mě to už dlouho, ale byl to úkol, který byl zcela nepodstatný. Jenže tento týden jsem měl trochu deficit programování a zároveň se tato chyba projevila i u nově přidané nabídky práce, že už jsem se naštval a řekl jsem si, že to opravím.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Již dříve jsem se pokoušel to vyřešit, ale kvůli architektuře systému (splachovací databáze, separátní procesy scraperů, předpřipravená pipeline od Scrapy, do které nejde zas tak moc hrabat, kešování) všechna přímočará řešení selhala. Teď jsem si matně pamatoval, že jediné, co mě kdysi ještě napadlo, bylo uložit si původní rozměry obrázku do EXIFu po tom, co ho stáhnu a zmenším, a pak je číst později při vybírání vhodného obrázku. To mi nyní přišlo jako velký úlet, takže jsem strávil několik hodin tím, že jsem prošel všechna ta přimočará, ale nefunkční řešení, která jsem prošel už dřív, vždy skončil na hlasitém „aha, ale to takhle vlastně nepůjde!“ a nakonec se vrátil k tomu, že jsem to udělal opravdu přes ten EXIF :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celé je to &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/junior.guru/blob/master/juniorguru/scrapers/pipelines/company_logo.py"&gt;tady&lt;/a&gt;. Použil jsem &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/"&gt;Pillow&lt;/a&gt; (ten už jsem tam měl) a &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/piexif/"&gt;piexif&lt;/a&gt;. Funkci na výběr nejvhodnějšího obrázku mám i hezky otestovanou. Dal jsem do kódu mohutný komentář, který vysvětluje, že EXIF je opravdu nejlepší volba a pokud si někdo v budoucnu bude myslet, že je to padlé na hlavu a existuje jednodušší řešení, tak ať si to nemyslí. Chvíli jsem zápasil s tím, do jakých metadat původní rozměry obrázku vložit, ale nakonec jsem vybral něco, co měl piexif rovnou v příkladech. Stejně je to fuk, ty obrázky se použijí jen na JG a tyto údaje slouží pouze pro tu scrapy pipelinu. V první řadě se vybírá takový obrázek, jehož původní rozměry byly co nejvíc čtveraté:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;similarity_to_square&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;abs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ale zároveň pokud je obrázek moc malý, tak to nehraje roli:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;or&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;similarity_to_square&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Z těchto obrázků se vybere ten, který má větší „rozlohu“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="smlouva-nad-ramec-vseobecnych-obchodnich-podminek"&gt;Smlouva nad rámec všeobecných obchodních podmínek&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#smlouva-nad-ramec-vseobecnych-obchodnich-podminek" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Komunikoval jsem s právničkou, abychom doladili ještě nějaké otázky ohledně mé dohody s jednou vzdělávací agenturou. Neodpovídala a nakonec jsem zjistil, že jí ani nefunguje web. Napsal jsem SMS a zjistili jsme, že jí vypršela doména, ale maily jí chodí, zapomněla mi odpověď akorát odeslat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mezitím jsem se snažil aspoň sám zjistit, co vlastně potřebuji. Přišel jsem na to, že asi něco jako „smlouvu s včleňovací doložkou“, ale nakonec je posudek právničky takový, že nemám dělat byrokrata, že úplně stačí nějaký obyč papír. To je poprvé, kdy mi právníci navrhují něco méně právnického, než navrhuji já sám :D Asi mě ten Oracle nakonec opravdu nějak poznamenal. No, teď mám už vše potřebné pro uzavření dohody, ale v pátek už jsem to nedokázal dotáhnout do konce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="smutny"&gt;Smutný&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#smutny" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jsem smutná&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Jsem veselá&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Většinou je to jedno&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MSXuX_p1v0"&gt;Pusťte si!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Měl jsem trochu depku, že se nikam neposouvám a nic nestíhám. Přemýšlel jsem, jestli se moc neutápím v každodenní administrativě a komunikaci s lidma, uzavírání nových partnerství apod. Jestli toho není tak moc, že při tom nestíhám dělat už nic jiného. Nakonec jsem si vsugeroval, že dělám ty materiály pro Engeto a to mi bere hodně času (hlavně ta prokrastinace psaní, ta toho času žere fakt hodně!), i když to není zrovna teď nikde vidět, a že po pondělku bude už Engeto hotové. A že smlouvu s další agenturou nějak už doklepnu a uzavřu, a že pak bude čas konečně zas dělat na samotném webu JG a na příručce. Těším se na to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mám v hlavě dokonalou představu, jak by která část JG měla vypadat, jak chci přebudovat příručku, pracovní nabídky, jak bude vypadat nová úvodní stránka klubu, apod. Všechno to mám vymyšlené a myslím, že tak jak to chci, tak to dává perfektní smysl na dlouhé měsíce dopředu, nevěřím, že se to pak už bude nějak překotně měnit, spíš budu jen přidávat nový obsah. Teď už to jen celé teda překopat :D Bude to hodně práce, bude to chtít hodně času. Ale snad už s tím brzo teda začnu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Budu muset začít stránkou klubu, aby ze zlepšila konverze lidí do klubu, protože teď ta stránka moc dobře neláká na vše, co člověk v klubu dostane. Je to úplně prapůvodní stránka z února, kdy bylo v klubu pět lidí a sám jsem netušil, kam se to vyvine. Teď vím, co mám a kde jsou největší benefity, které chci na té stránce vysvětlit a lidem „prodat“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potom nahodím nový ceník pro firmy, ale upřímně, už jsem dost uvažoval i nad tím, že bych ho tam napevno nalinkoval jako ten Google Dokument, který mám teď, protože ho budu moci doplňovat a ladit a nebude mě to stát žádné nervy s HTML a CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No a potom asi přijde na řadu příručka, překopat, nový design, rozházet obsah do více stránek, přidat nový obsah, revidovat existující, atd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zašel jsem si na očkování. Díky očkování jsem měl příležitost si uvědomit, že ačkoliv jsem oficiálně levák, všechno kromě psaní dělám pravou :D&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zrovna minule jsem tu myslím psal, že jsem zkoumal knihovny, které umožňují extrahovat hlavní text na stránce. No a hned potom můj oblíbený Simon Willison &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1401656327869394945"&gt;tweetuje dotaz v podobném smyslu&lt;/a&gt;. Ta &lt;a href="https://github.com/adbar/trafilatura"&gt;trafilatura&lt;/a&gt; vypadá zajímavě.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spoustu času jsem strávil s lidmi v klubu, vítáním nových členů, tříděním pracovních nabídek, vyřizováním e-mailů a trochu i se sociálními sítěmi, ale ty jsem měl většinu týdne opět zablokované.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psal jsem si s jednou další firmou o tom, jak bychom mohli spolupracovat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volal jsem si s &lt;a href="https://www.nadaniadovednosti.cz/"&gt;Nadání a dovednosti&lt;/a&gt; a dohodli jsme se, že moje nabídka dává smysl a že to nějak doladíme a zkusíme uvést v praxi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zmeškal jsem skrze kostrbatou komunikaci přes LinkedIn a e-maily o jeden den nějaké zasedání Federace dětských domovů, kde jsem teoreticky mohl prezentovat nabídku pro DD. Možná dobře, aspoň to lépe připravím do podzimu, kdy má být další. Prý lepší oslovit DD tam, osobně. Pokud nebude další vlna covidu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volal jsem si s Mews a dohodli jsme se na dalším postupu. Ladíme podobu něčeho jako stipendia/fin aid balíčku, který bychom mohli dávat znevýhodněným lidem s potenciálem dostat se do IT. Bylo by v tom členství v klubu, ale třeba i nějaký kurz apod. Celkově mi to přijde jako strašně super nápad. To, že budu pomáhat znevýhodněným do IT, mám ve své vizi už dávno. Když jsem ale v začátcích JG psal na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/donate/"&gt;donate stránku&lt;/a&gt; „aby každý Luďan z Mostu měl po ruce návod, jak začít s programováním“, tak jsem sám tak úplně nevěřil tomu, že to dokážu dotáhnout až takhle daleko a oslovím s tím i někoho jiného, než lidi z Karlína s latéčkem v ruce. No a teď to vypadá, že asi fakt snad brzo budu reálně schopný pomoci i někomu třeba z dětského domova.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přišla nová nabídka práce na JG, tentokrát dokonce placená. Recruiter v jiné firmě byl zmatený z mé nabídky (což se mu vůbec nedivím), tak jsme si vyměnili telefony a teď si občas voláme. Mělo by z toho být hned několik placených nabídek práce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investorka nevěřila, že vydělávám pořád jen 20 tisíc čistého. Tak jsem zkoušel v tabulkách hledat chybu, v jejímž důsledku by čísla byla špatně a mohl bych díky tomu zjistit, že ve skutečnosti vydělávám víc. Chybu jsem hledal hodinu, ale žádnou jsem nenašel :D&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 7 dní od 5.6. do 11.6. jsem při procházkách nachodil 6 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 1 hodin a zdolal při tom 6 kilometrů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tři věci, které bych chtěl zvládnout udělat příště:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Konečně uzavřít dohodu s jednou vzdělávací agenturou.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Začít dělat novou úvodní stránku pro klub.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dokončit v pondělí to, co spolu podnikáme s Engetem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonusy:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pověnovat se Python komunitě, uspořádat schůzi výboru, členskou schůzi, zajít na &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/naPyvo/status/1403312699291938816"&gt;první letošní Pyvo naživo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pověnovat se &lt;a href="https://na.pycon.org/"&gt;PyCon Namibia&lt;/a&gt;, který je letos online, lístky &lt;a href="https://na.pycon.org/tickets/"&gt;zde&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ani nevím jak, ale týden je pryč. Musím přiznat, že otevření zahrádek a jarní počasí mi na produktivitě moc nepřidalo, především tím, jak se lidé chtějí zase najednou scházet a dělat spolu věci. Nějak jsem si přes pandemii odvykl :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ladeni-obchodnich-podminek-a-dohody-nad-jejich-ramec"&gt;Ladění obchodních podmínek a dohody nad jejich rámec&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#ladeni-obchodnich-podminek-a-dohody-nad-jejich-ramec" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Řešil jsem s právničkou obchodní podmínky. Udělali jsme nějaké změny, ale nakonec méně změn, než jsme původně mysleli. Myšlenka je taková, že když je to otevřenější, mohu dělat dohody s firmami víc na míru. Jenže když pak firma chce nějaký papír, tak co?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud si s firmou něco dohodnu nad rámec obchodních podmínek a nestačí jim „čestné slovo v e-mailu“, existuje jednoduchý způsob, jak to mohu „sepsat na papír a podepsat“, což bychom pak já i druhá strana mohli aspoň archivovat? Jde mi o to, zda si to mám celé vymyslet, nebo to má název, náležitosti a třeba i vzorovou podobu. Asi začátečnický dotaz, ale já celý život jen posílal faktury proti dohodám v e-mailech, tak se to opravdu teprve učím :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samé otázky!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uklid-v-administraci-klubu"&gt;Úklid v administraci klubu&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#uklid-v-administraci-klubu" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minule jsem psal, jak se mi povedlo udělat si přehlednou tabulku členů a že mám i členy, které neeviduje Memberful, protože byli v klubu ještě dřív, než jsem vůbec nějaký Memberful měl. Tento týden jsem je postupně kontaktoval a zahlazovali jsme různé nesrovnalosti v datech. Ochotně klikali na odkazy a registrovali se na Memberful, takže super, budu v tom mít za chvíli super pořádek. Narovnal jsem při tom i nějaká firemní partnerství vzhledem k tomu, jaké chystám změny v ceníku a podmínkách.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co se týče firem, udělal jsem si novou tabulku, kde mám teď krásně přehledně všechny firmy a dohody. Překvapilo mě, že rekonstruovat všechny dohody z e-mailů mi zabralo tolik času. Každopádně tabulka je hotová. Chtěl jsem z ní dynamicky vypisovat loga do webu nebo přidat do klubu roli „sponzorujeme klub“, ale to jsem tento týden už nestihl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="afrika"&gt;Afrika&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#afrika" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Už je to víc jak rok od mé návštěvy &lt;a href="https://na.pycon.org/"&gt;PyCon NA&lt;/a&gt;. Měl jsem tehdy plnou hlavu nápadů, co všechno udělám, jaké články na blog o tom napíšu, jaké spolupráce zkusíme udělat, ale covid to tak nějak všechno smetl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zkusil jsem se k tomu tento týden vrátit a aspoň pár týdnů před tím, než bude PyCon NA 2021, zkouším narychlo spáchat rozhovor s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JessicaUpani"&gt;Jessicou Upani&lt;/a&gt; s tím, že jej vydám tady na blogu. Skoro celý jeden den jsem připravoval různé otázky a posílal jí je, teď čekám na odpovědi. Narazil jsem při tom (znova) na &lt;a href="https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/zahranici/pohnuty-osud-namibijskych-deti-miluji-pohadky-a-dodnes-umi-c/r~527886babed911ebb9860cc47ab5f122/"&gt;tuhle haluz&lt;/a&gt;, o které jsem vůbec nevěděl, tak jsem se zaposlouchal do &lt;a href="https://a2larm.cz/2021/04/katerina-mildnerova-zivotni-pribehy-namibijskych-deti-vychovanych-v-ceskoslovensku-jsou-casto-velmi-temne/"&gt;podcastu&lt;/a&gt; apod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Navíc se to zrovna sešlo, že se mi ozval i &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/marianomugana"&gt;Mariano Mugana&lt;/a&gt; z Mozambiku, kterého jsem osobně potkal v Namibii a který v Maputu organizuje všechny možné akce pro místní programátorky a programátory. Tehdy se mi u piva svěřil, že je smutný, že se jim nepovede nikdy vybudovat tak mezinárodní akci jako v Namibii, protože se v Mozambiku nemluví anglicky a ani já bych tam nemohl mít tu svou keynote, nikdo by mi nerozuměl. Tak jsme spolu vymysleli, že přece jenom nejsou jediná země, která mluví portugalsky, a že se mi jej třeba podaří s někým spojit. Tento týden jsem se věnoval tomu, že jsem se jej snažil nějak propojit s kamarádem z Portugalska a dalším z Brazílie. Jsem zvědavý, co vymyslí. V dnešní době online meetupů by nemuselo být tak složité, aby si střihli přednášku v Mozambiku a třeba, pokud budou dobrodružné povahy a covid tomu nebude stát v cestě, třeba se tam jednou i zajedou podívat na nějaký PyCon, kdo ví?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="csr"&gt;CSR&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#csr" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporate Social Responsibility je balíček, který chci na JG mít pro firmy - že budou proplácet členství lidem, kterým by členství mohlo významně pomoci v životě a kariéře.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prošel jsem všechny nedokončené e-mailové konverzace s lidmi z neziskovek a dětských domovů a odepsal. Nakonec se mi přece jenom povedlo narazit na nějaké kontakty, ale budou to asi konverzace a domluvy na dýl, takže uvažuji i o tom, že věc začnu prokopávat taky z druhé strany. Uvažuji o tom, že na nové &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/club/"&gt;stránce pro klub&lt;/a&gt;, kterou chystám, bude i možnost přihlásit se do klubu skrze „fin aid“ formulář. Tam by člověk vyplnil e-mail a „motivační dopis“. Já bych pak mohl tyto přihlášky trochu třídit od nesmyslů a motivační dopisy anonymně ukazovat firmám a nechávat je rozhodnout se, zda chtějí člověku členství proplácet. Takovým způsobem bychom možná mohli i přijít na lidi, na které bychom přes nějaké neziskovky nikdy nepřišli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objevil jsem článek o &lt;a href="http://www.romea.cz/cz/zpravodajstvi/domaci/frantisek-nemet-v-budoucnu-chci-pracovat-s-umelou-inteligenci"&gt;Františkovi&lt;/a&gt; a hned psal na Romea, jestli Franta nechce do klubu, ale už to měli dávno pošéfované a klub mu nabízeli, takže tohle asi do budoucna už řešit opravdu nemusím, spolupráci máme nastavenou :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jsem v kontaktu s &lt;a href="https://www.fosaops.org/"&gt;Fosa&lt;/a&gt;, kde možná něco vymyslíme pro lidi s nejrůznějším omezením, ale to se ještě uvidí.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sepsal jsem nějaký ten odstavec do materiálů, které společně tvoříme s Engetem. Hezky nám to roste, ale ještě pár iterací si to vezme. Následující dva týdny mě to asi bude ještě významně vytěžovat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trochu jsem se věnoval i sociálním sítím, ať už to byly různé odpovědi nebo retweety.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ozval se mi známý se zajímavou příležitostí pro juniory ve firmě, která dělá simulace pro armády. Dal jsem ji do klubu. Pokud vás něco takového zajímá, napište mi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Člen klubu mě upozornil na to, že mi na webu nefunguje u některých inzerátů tlačítko na odpovězení na inzerát. Zjistil jsem, že má pravdu a že tento průšvih tam byl minimálně pár týdnů :( Promptně jsem to opravil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vytvořil jsem a poslal &lt;a href="https://us3.campaign-archive.com/?u=7d3f89ef9b2ed953ddf4ff5f6&amp;amp;id=949e6f04cf"&gt;květnový newsletter&lt;/a&gt;. Moc jsem se s ním nemazal, v plánu je postupně jej upozaďovat a soustředit se na klub. Proto dostává více méně šablonovitou podobu, kdy v novinkách pod nabídkami práce už jsou jen generické položky, které z měsíce na měsíc prakticky neměním.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tato &lt;a href="https://www.jobstack.it/it-job/python-developer/5a4c0a132a51f"&gt;pěkně napsaná nabídka práce&lt;/a&gt; mě přivedla k průzkumu jak inzerující firmy, tak portálu Jobstack.it. Přidal jsem si zase nějaké lidi na LinkedIn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uzavřeli jsme dohodu s &lt;a href="https://github.com/MewsSystems/developers"&gt;Mews&lt;/a&gt;, že budou podporovat klub. Zavolali jsme si tento týden a domlouvali se na další strategii a tom, jak mohou využít klub naplno.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prošel jsem si záznamy přednášek z &lt;a href="https://frontendisti.cz/konference"&gt;konference Frontendistů&lt;/a&gt;, která proběhla o víkendu, a ty, které jsem neviděl a vidět chtěl, jsem si naházel do Pocketu. Pár jsem si jich dokonce už i pustil, stopáž 15-20 minut tomu velmi nahrává. Najít si čas na hodinovou přednášku je problém.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prodloužil jsem doménu &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/"&gt;junior.guru&lt;/a&gt;, zatím to vypadá, že ještě rok to existovat bude :D&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nabil jsem si kredit na Wedosu, aby se z něj platily domény. Toto si bohužel zaslouží bod v poznámkách, protože mi to zabralo příliš mnoho času. Při hledání „jak dobít účet wedos“ jsem ale aspoň našel &lt;a href="https://help.wedos.cz/otazka/chci-zaplatit-domenu-jak/44751/"&gt;tento zoufalý výkřik&lt;/a&gt; a to mě pobavilo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1398243224863621126"&gt;Zkoumal jsem&lt;/a&gt;, odkud by se daly stahovat nabídky práce pro veřejnou správu. Samozřejmě cílem by bylo dostat nabídky práce &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/"&gt;sem&lt;/a&gt;. Z konverzací pod tweetem zatím vyplývá, že nabídky jsou nejvíc asi na jobs.cz a že moje hypotéza, že jsou to příležitosti pro juniory, je spíš správná.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Potýkal jsem se s nějakou chybou v knihovně strictyaml, kterou rád používám na čtení YAML na všech novějších projektech. Založil jsem &lt;a href="https://github.com/crdoconnor/strictyaml/issues/151"&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt;, chyba je v nějaké závislosti, takže maintainer zatím jen vydal fix s downgradem té závislosti.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Podobnou opravu jsme &lt;a href="https://github.com/Frozen-Flask/Frozen-Flask/pull/114"&gt;společnými silami udělali na Frozen-Flask&lt;/a&gt; s Flaskem, protože se nakonec opravdu ukázalo, že nový Flask pracuje jinak se statickými soubory a Frozen-Flask s ním nefunguje správně. Vydal jsem &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/Frozen-Flask/0.17/"&gt;v0.17&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Film &lt;a href="https://www.csfd.cz/film/892942-nova-sichta/"&gt;Nová šichta&lt;/a&gt; jde do kin. Běžte na něj!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 7 dní od 29.5. do 4.6. jsem naběhal 10 km, při procházkách nachodil 15 km, ujel na kole 28 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 10 hodin a zdolal při tom 53 kilometrů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="co-planuji"&gt;Co plánuji&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#co-planuji" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tři věci, které bych chtěl zvládnout udělat příště:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Konečně uzavřít dohodu s jednou vzdělávací agenturou.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vypisovat loga na web z tabulky firem, doplnit roli „sponzorujeme klub“ do Discordu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dokončovat materiály, na kterém pracujeme spolu s Engetem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-co-vy"&gt;A co vy?&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#a-co-vy" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud byste čistě náhodou měli dojem, že jste oproti mě za uplynulý týden vůbec nic nestihli, tak mám pro vás skvělou zprávu! V klidu se na ten dojem &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/neni-to-zavod/"&gt;můžete vykašlat&lt;/a&gt;. Není zač!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="co-me-zaujalo"&gt;Co mě zaujalo&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#co-me-zaujalo" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když si něco přečtu nebo poslechnu a líbí se mi to, &lt;a href="https://getpocket.com/@honzajavorek"&gt;sdílím to na Pocketu&lt;/a&gt;. Od posledních poznámek jsem sdílel toto:&lt;/p&gt;

Taky zajímavá zmínka o tom, že pokud toto téma nepovažují za zajímavé novináři nebo jejich šéfové, na prostor nedostanou. Bude Feriho objíždění škol se záměrem inspirovat mladé k politice nakonec paradoxně důvodem, proč tytéž školy teď začnou lépe vyučovat témata kolem konsenzuálního sexu?&lt;/li&gt;

V českých školách i rodinách chybí sexuální i vztahová osvěta a mladé ženy si pak logicky myslí, že je přirozené, že se k nim muž chová jako ke kusu hadru. Pro všechny bude lepší, pokud se přinejmenším toto smýšlení začne vlivem Feriho kauzy měnit.“&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id="vylepsovani-klubu"&gt;Vylepšování klubu&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#vylepsovani-klubu" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tento týden jsem chtěl na delší dobu završit zvelebování klubu, abych se posléze přesunul zase zpátky k webu, pracovním nabídkám, příručce. Prošel jsem si nápady, které mám v záloze a vyšly mi z toho hlavně dvě věci.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Špendlíky. Někoho napadlo, že by se mohlo připínat v kanálech víc příspěvků, aby se k nim šlo vracet a viděli zajímavé věci i noví lidi, kteří přijdou. Jenže já nevím, co je pro většinu členů tímto způsobem zajímavé. Nakonec jsem to udělal tak, že když má nějaký příspěvek hodně emoji se špendlíkem, bot příspěvek připne. Jenže proč by to kdo dělal, že? Pouze vyhlídka toho, že příspěvek se možná připne, to nestačí. Chtěl jsem, aby to mělo i nějakou hodnotu pro každého daného člověka. A to už byl jen krok k tomu, abych vymyslel, že když dá člověk špendlík na příspěvek, bot mu jej uloží do soukromých zpráv. Člen, který si takto něco připíchne, z toho přímo sám benefituje, může si ukládat zajímavé příspěvky a vracet se k nim, zároveň pokud to udělá hodně lidí (procento z počtu členů v klubu), příspěvek se připne pro všechny. Podle mě ideální synergie individuálně užitečné funkce s komunitně užitečnou funkcí, fakt se mi to líbí, ale uvidíme, jak se to uchytí. Při tvorbě této funkce jsem udělal vtipnou chybu - když se to poprvé pustilo, poslalo to soukromou zprávu, kde bylo každé písmenko na svém vlastním řádku :D Ale už to je opraveno.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Další věc byla automatické posílání pozvánek na Pyvo a na srazy Frontendistů. To by nebylo nic moc složitého, oba srazy mají iCal feed, který by šlo načíst, zpracovat, ládovat budoucí srazy do kanálu. Jenže když jsem si dělal úvodní analýzu a přemýšlel, jak to vyrobím, došlo mi, že je to celé mnohem složitější. Srazy jsou původně vázané na různá města, Brno, Praha, Plzeň, atd. Tak je to u Pyva i Frontendistů. To, že nyní probíhají online, je přechodný stav. Můj klub je online a lidi v něm jsou ze všech koutů republiky. Někteří nikdy nebudou moci jen tak přijít na nějaký sraz v Praze nebo Brně. Posílat všechny srazy do nějakého kanálu by bylo irelevantní pro velkou část členů. Upozornění na sraz v Praze hezký, ale zajímavé pro 10 lidí. V Brně? Zajímavé pro 5 lidí. Cílem klubu je vyloženě být online komunitou pro začátečníky, kteří kolem sebe komunitu nemají. Pro ty, kteří nemohou snadno dojít na sraz, ať už kvůli rodinnému životu nebo tomu, že jsou z vesnice. Pozvánkami na prezenční akce bych vlastně podrýval smysl celého klubu. Proto jsem tuto funkci nakonec zavrhl. Do budoucna bych to viděl tak, že bych tam klidně agregoval online akce, ale prezenční spíš ne. Budu to muset produktově lépe promyslet. Každopádně bude strategičtější si počkat i na to, jak se srazy vyvinou do budoucna a tuto funkci řešit třeba až uvidím, jak to funguje napodzim a ne teď nebo v létě.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dále jsem zase trochu přeuspořádal kanály v klubu podle toho, jak je lidé používají, založil nové, aktualizoval pravidla a popsal do nich nejrůznější tipy na to, jak se v klubu orientovat. Do kanálů k jednotlivým technologiím jsem přidal vysvětlující připnuté příspěvky. Pokusil jsem se lépe a viditelněji objasnit, jak přesně používat kanály na mentoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V nějakém článku o budování komunit jsem četl několik tipů, co bych měl dělat. Článek už nenajdu, ale dělal jsem si z něj poznámky. Myslím, že následující se mi nějak povedlo v klubu udělat:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Establish rewards for engaged members. Building an active community can take time — but rewarding special roles or privileges to active users can help incentivize more activity. This can be like a special color for their name, high spot on a list of users, or the ability to react to messages with emotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build hooks into your community to boost engagement. Everything Marketplaces and Compound send weekly digests. Trends Pro Members join conversations after receiving weekly reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="detske-domovy-a-dalsi"&gt;Dětské domovy a další&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#detske-domovy-a-dalsi" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moje kontaktáž dětských domovů z minula se trochu posunula. Napsal mi na LinkedIn jeden ředitel DD, napsala mi jedna neziskovka do mailu, komunikuju s jedním insiderem na Messengeru. Nicméně jsem nic z toho tento týden nedotáhl, bylo to na vedlejší koleji. Třeba se k tomu zvládnu vrátit příští týden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/juniordotguru/"&gt;IG JG&lt;/a&gt; začal sledovat účet &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/fosaops/"&gt;Fosa&lt;/a&gt;, tak jsem jim taky cvičně napsal, odepsali, ale já už nezvládl něco odpovědět. Mail jsem ale četl a z jeho formulace vyplývá, že si myslí, že dělám kurzy programování. Budu muset vylepšit formulace na webu nebo v e-mailech tak, aby bylo jasnější, co dělám a jakou to má přesně hodnotu. Komunikace s neziskovkami, které jsou z úplně jiných oborů, je zajímavý způsob, jak si natrénovat vysvětlování mého projektu na lidech, kteří o něm předem nic neví.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="prace-pro-jg"&gt;Práce pro JG&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#prace-pro-jg" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Členka klubu, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mia-bajic/"&gt;Mia&lt;/a&gt;, mi navrhla, že bych se o nějaké činnosti mohl podělit s více lidmi a nechat je pracovat na JG, aby to víc odsýpalo, třeba formou dobrovolnictví, brigády. Je to dobrý nápad a měl bych nad tím přemýšlet víc a někam si bokem odkládat věci, kde mi mohou lidé pomoci.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blbé je, že jsem ten web teď vykutil takovým způsobem, že tam prostě všechno narychlo nějak peču a půlka je připálená a v kuchyni je spousta kouře a štípou z toho oči. Potřeboval bych ten repozitář víc připravit na to, aby do něj mohl někdo přispět, a tak. Taky mi přijde blbé nechat lidi pracovat přímo na věcech, které mi mají generovat nějaký zisk, např. lákat lidi do klubu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neplacená stáž na Open Source projektu s pozitivním vedlejším efektem, proč ne, ale asi ne na věcech jako nový ceník pro firmy nebo nová úvodní stránka pro klub, což jsou věci, které teď potřebuji nejvíc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="reserse-kolem-budoucnosti-pracovnich-nabidek"&gt;Rešerše kolem budoucnosti pracovních nabídek&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#reserse-kolem-budoucnosti-pracovnich-nabidek" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stále uvažuji, jak do budoucna vylepšit pracovní nabídky. Napadlo mě, že by nemuselo být „těžké“ mít program, který je schopen z libovolného URL extrahovat text pracovní nabídky a analyzovat jej. Šlo by použít totéž, co používá &lt;em&gt;reader view&lt;/em&gt; ve Firefoxu nebo věci jako Pocket, Instapaper, atd. Udělal jsem si k tomu úvodní rešerši, zde si ukládám odkazy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/buriy/python-readability"&gt;python-readability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/ReadabiliPy"&gt;ReadabiliPy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/goose3/goose3"&gt;goose3&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://github.com/jiminoc/goose/wiki"&gt;goose wiki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla/readability"&gt;readability&lt;/a&gt;, které zajišťuje &lt;em&gt;reader view&lt;/em&gt; ve Firefoxu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lepsi-administrace"&gt;Lepší administrace&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#lepsi-administrace" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vytvořil jsem skript, který mi stáhne data z Memberful o platících uživatelích, stáhne data z Discordu, spojí je a přehled mi hodí do Google Sheets do tabulky, kde si to můžu analyzovat a filtrovat. Už při prvním koukání do tabulky jsem zjistil, že je to zajímavé počtení, např. z toho jde vidět úspěšnost různých slevových kupónů a tak. Musím to lépe prostudovat, už se těším. Management kupónů není v Memberful moc dobrý, nebo dobrý je, ale ne pro moje specifické kupónové čachry, takže toto mi pomůže v lepší orientaci.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Také mohu hned kontrolovat podezřelé uživatele. Ve středu do klubu v jedné minutě přišlo asi šest nových členů, což jsem moc nechápal a bál jsem se, že je to nějaký hack, útok, nějaká díra v systému, že mi někdo zneužívá kupóny. Ale z dat v tabulce jasně vyplývá, že jsou to všechno smrtelníci a výpis v klubu je asi jen nějaká chyba v Discordu, možná měl chybu a neposílal uvítací zprávy a když to opravili, poslal je všechny najednou pro několik členů, kteří mezitím přišli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Také se chystám projít si &lt;a href="https://memberful.com/help/how-to/give-free-access/"&gt;tuto stránku&lt;/a&gt; a podle návodů v ní dát oficiální přístup do klubu lidem, kteří na Discordu byli ještě dříve než Memberful a nejsou s Memberful propojení. Chtěl bych v tom mít pořádek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Naprogramoval jsem &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/junior.guru/blob/master/scripts/draw_winners.py"&gt;losovací skript&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/43wgNpMNYow"&gt;vylosoval výherce&lt;/a&gt; volňásků na sobotní &lt;a href="https://frontendisti.cz/konference"&gt;FrontKon&lt;/a&gt;. Konferenci jsem propagoval na sociálních sítích.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sdílel jsem na sociálních sítích &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB31aubcjno"&gt;přednášku o juniorech z SREconu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ptal jsem se lidí, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1397798482287734786"&gt;zda neznají další české programátorské Discordy&lt;/a&gt;. O žádných, o kterých bych nevěděl, jsem se nedověděl. Možná špatná bublina, měl bych se ptát mezi mladýma a ne na sítích pro páprdy, Twitteru a Facebooku. Ty Discordy, které znám, jsem nalinkoval z klubu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nasbíralo se mi zhruba milion různých mailů, tak jsem se jimi probíral a všechny jsem doteď ani neprošel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odpovídal jsem různě v klubu, na jeden dotaz jsem napsal několik příspěvků o objemu článku na blog. Nechám to uzrát a třeba to pak učešu a někdy vydám i na blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jsem na pokraji uzavření partnerství s &lt;a href="https://github.com/MewsSystems/developers"&gt;Mews&lt;/a&gt;, na stránku klubu už jsem dal i jejich logo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/"&gt;JetBrains&lt;/a&gt; přidali na JG tři nabídky na stáže. Wow! :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Popohnal jsem právničku s aktualizací obchodních podmínek.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zkoušel jsem jen tak cvičně, jak těžké by bylo vytvořit nový scraper na nabídky práce z dalšího zdroje. Nedokončil jsem to a nevím, kdy se k tomu vrátím.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refaktoroval jsem v kódu věci kolem načítání dat z Discordu, byl to maglajz v jednom souboru, teď je z toho souborů asi pět.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vytvořil jsem lapač hledačů na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/topics/unicorn/"&gt;Unicorn University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rozeslal jsem na Slacku a e-mailovou pozvánkou do kalendáře členům Pyvce pozvánku na členskou schůzi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Řešil jsem s pár dalšíma lidma člena klubu ze základky (viz minulé poznámky), ale brzy se vše vyřešilo tak nějak samo. Klukovi došla trpělivost a programování vzdal, odešel sám jak z klubu, tak i z jiných programovacích Discordů. Nedokázal překonat to, že při programování člověk stále debuguje a řeší, proč mu něco nefunguje. Nepomohlo ani to, že jsme se mu snažili pomáhat a motivovat jej.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Několikrát za týden jsem procházel nabídky práce a hodnotil je, aby se mohla umělá inteligence učit. Ke konci týdne jsem trochu upravil vyhledávací dotazy v některých zdrojích inzerátů a výsledkem bylo nárazově velké množství dalších položek na ohodnocení. Vše jsem poctivě prošel. Zahlédl jsem věty jako „Alespoň základní znalost Pythonu plus nějaký programovací jazyk“ nebo „mladý dynamický kolektiv“, což jsem myslel, že už se objevuje jen ve vtipech. Teď už jen aby se to hodnocení opravdu nějak promítalo do učení té AI, to by bylo super. Ale tímto na tebe Mílo nechci rozhodně nijak tlačit :D&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dále jsem pracoval na tom, abychom s Engetem připravili společný materiál. Píšeme texty, dělal jsem tento týden hodně reviews.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zjistil jsem, že mám v klubu bývalého kolegu pana Luboše, jenž se proslavil komentovanou opravou traktoru Lakatoš. Svět je malý!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 7 dní od 22.5. do 28.5. jsem naběhal 19 km, při procházkách nachodil 11 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 6 hodin a zdolal při tom 30 kilometrů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="co-planuji"&gt;Co plánuji&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#co-planuji" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tři věci, které bych chtěl zvládnout udělat příště:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dát si dopořádku evidenci firemních dohod, faktur, předplatných, mít hezkou tabulku a přidat do klubu roli „Sponzorujeme klub“. Dát dopořádku členství přes Memberful pro ty, kteří jsou v klubu, ale Memberful nemají.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Udělat rozhovor s Jessicou Upani.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dokončovat materiály spolu s Engetem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-co-vy"&gt;A co vy?&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#a-co-vy" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud byste čistě náhodou měli dojem, že jste oproti mě za uplynulý týden vůbec nic nestihli, tak mám pro vás skvělou zprávu! V klidu se na ten dojem &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/neni-to-zavod/"&gt;můžete vykašlat&lt;/a&gt;. Není zač!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Když si něco přečtu nebo poslechnu a líbí se mi to, &lt;a href="https://getpocket.com/@honzajavorek"&gt;sdílím to na Pocketu&lt;/a&gt;. Tento týden samý Feri. Sorry! Od posledních poznámek jsem sdílel toto:&lt;/p&gt;

Může vám být nepříjemné, že existuje feminismus, ale nezastavíte jej umlčením feministek. Museli byste vrátit technologický pokrok do 19. století, což není možné. Minulá uspořádání společnosti byla dobře přizpůsobena na tehdejší úroveň pokroku, dnes by zcela selhávala. Namlouvat si, že ne, je nostalgie a romantika.&lt;/li&gt;

Některé věci jako přes kopírák (Trump, Brexit, ale i Česko), některé unikátně indické, vzhledem k historii, počtu obyvatel, kastovnímu systému, mnohonárodnostnímu a mnohonáboženskému uspořádání, ke kterým se těžko hledají paralely.&lt;/li&gt;

Spolu s tím, jak nižší vrstvy nemají žádné zastoupení, nevěří establishmentu a přiklánějí se k SPD a lidem jako Volný. Bude-li tato tendence pokračovat, může nás to jednou dost překvapit - až těmto lidem bouchnou saze, abychom se nedočkali zase toho, že se bude stavět další „most inteligence“ a do parlamentu budou moci jen traktoristi. Zajímavý je i postřeh, že zástupce menšiny, který je ze vzdělané třídy, zastupuje tuto vzdělanou třídu a ne lidi ze stejné menšiny, kteří jsou chudí a žijí v ghettu.&lt;/li&gt;

Taky zajímavá zmínka o tom, že pokud toto téma nepovažují za zajímavé novináři nebo jejich šéfové, na prostor nedostanou. Bude Feriho objíždění škol se záměrem inspirovat mladé k politice nakonec paradoxně důvodem, proč tytéž školy teď začnou lépe vyučovat témata kolem konsenzuálního sexu?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hlavní úkol na tento týden byl prolomit prokrastinaci a pracovat na textech, které budou sloužit jako podklady pro speciální věc, kterou tvořím spolu s Engetem. I vzhledem k přednášce v klubu jsem zabral až ve čtvrtek, a to potom, co jsem ve středu těkal z úkolu na úkol a neudělal jsem skoro nic podstatného. Jako obvykle pomohlo zablokovat všechny sociální sítě ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Čtvrtek i pátek jsem potom z velké části věnoval psaní.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="prednaska-s-vildou"&gt;Přednáška s Vildou&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#prednaska-s-vildou" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V úterý proběhla &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/events/#2021-05-18T18-00-00"&gt;přednáška s Vildou&lt;/a&gt; o cestě HTTP požadavku, v podstatě úvod do sítí. Proběhla skvěle, mělo to dobré ohlasy a sám jsem se spoustu věcí přiučil nebo si zopakoval. Myslím, že to Vilibald vysvětlil líp, než mi to kdysi vysvětlovali na VŠ. Záznam se tentokrát povedl skvěle a zvuk je na něm pro změnu lepší, než byl v reálu :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Během pondělí, den před přednáškou, se mi povedlo dokončit jednu malou automatizaci, a to posílání zpráv do Discordu týden před přednáškou, pár dní před přednáškou, v den přednášky, apod. Teď už je nemusím psát já, udělá to za mě robot. Upravil jsem &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/honzajavorek/b1a77651e566cb6405a131bbf1fb0692"&gt;svůj seznam&lt;/a&gt;, aby odpovídal nové realitě.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vypadá to, že by další přednáška v klubu mohla být o &lt;a href="https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geografick%C3%BD_informa%C4%8Dn%C3%AD_syst%C3%A9m"&gt;GIS&lt;/a&gt;, tedy mapy a počítače. Ale uvidíme, není to potvrzené.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vyhlásil jsem v klubu soutěž o lístky na &lt;a href="https://frontendisti.cz/konference"&gt;konferenci Frontendistů&lt;/a&gt;. V rámci spolupráce jsem dostal tři lístky. Udělím je pomocí „import random“ z lidí, kteří o ně projevili zájem pomocí emoji. Losovat bych měl v pondělí a nahraju to, aby lidi viděli, že nepodvádím. Napíšu si na to nějaký skript. Myslel jsem, že ho vytvořím už tento týden, ale nevytvořil jsem ho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="clen-ze-zakladky"&gt;Člen ze základky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#clen-ze-zakladky" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V klubu se mi mým vlastním nedopatřením objevilo dítě ze základní školy, které svým chováním dělá trochu vlny. Trochu řeším, co s ním. Jestli ho vychovávat, nebo poslat jinam, aby mi to tam nerozložilo. Zase bych jej fakt nerad odradil od programování. Zaměstnává mě to ve větších či menších chvilkách poslední dva dny a je to věc, která rozhodně ovlivnila tento můj týden, ale je to otevřená kauza, tak se o tom nebudu více rozepisovat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akorát doplním, že si osobně při řešení té situace připadám dost neohrabaný, ale že mě v tomto podržel samotný klub tím, jak jsou tam všichni úžasní. Jeden člen se dokonce sám nabídl, že to pomůže nějak ukormidlovat. Jsem dojat :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="detske-domovy"&gt;Dětské domovy&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#detske-domovy" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zkoumám možnost, jak by šlo spolupracovat s dětskými domovy. To může vzhledem k předchozímu odstavci znít zvláštně, ale v dětských domovech nejsou jen děti, jsou tam i dospívající a někdy skoro dospělí lidé. Na předešlé e-maily mi bohužel nikdo neodpověděl. Tentokrát jsem napsal mnohem kratší e-mail s jasnou &lt;em&gt;call to action&lt;/em&gt;, aby věděli, co se mnou:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rozvoj dětí se zájmem o programování&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dobrý den,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;provozuji projekt https://junior.guru/ a ve spolupráci s firmami nás napadlo, že bychom mohli pomoci dospívajícím dětem z dětských domovů, které mají zájem o programování. Je totiž velmi těžké se tomu věnovat, pokud kolem sebe nemáte nikoho dalšího, kdo vás vede nebo vám pomůže, když si člověk neví s něčím rady.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naše pomoc by byla hlavně formou poskytnutí mentoringu a komunity dalších lidí, které také programování baví. Nevíme ovšem, kde vůbec takové děti, které by programování bavilo a měly možnost (především techniku) se v tomto směru realizovat, sehnat, a zda vůbec existují. Napadlo nás oslovit vás.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Můžeme se nějak spojit a probrat to? Díky,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Napsal jsem &lt;a href="https://www.dejmedetemsanci.cz/"&gt;DDŠ&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nadaniadovednosti.cz/"&gt;NaD&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.yourchance.cz/"&gt;yourchance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.fddcr.cz/"&gt;FDD&lt;/a&gt;. Opět zatím žádná odpověď. Nevím, co dělám špatně.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="napady-na-vylepseni-klubu"&gt;Nápady na vylepšení klubu&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#napady-na-vylepseni-klubu" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Udělalo mi radost, že sama komunita v klubu začala generovat tipy na to, co by se dalo zlepšit a dostal jsem i pár tipů na zvyklosti z jiných Discordů nebo na existující Discord boty. Například takový, který lidem hlídá účast na akcích. Budu to muset ještě prozkoumat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keď možem a viem tak vždy rad pomožem, o tomto komunita ma byť, nie len aby tam bol admin a moderator ale som rad ze to tu je žive a su tu fakt super prispevky a podobne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jedna z věcí, které jsme vymysleli, je připichování příspěvků, pokud se u nich objeví hodně emoji se špendlíky. Připíchnuté příspěvky lze pak snadno dohledat. Toto jsem ještě nenaprogramoval, ale přijde mi to fajn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vždy, když do klubového Discordu přijde nový člen, objeví se systémová zpráva, která na to upozorní. Doplnil jsem do klubového bota, aby u lidí, kteří se do klubu vrátí, přidal k této zprávě emoji s máváním a šipkami v kruhu. Sice se bot spouští zhruba jednou denně, takže to není úplně &lt;em&gt;realtime&lt;/em&gt;, ale i tak je to pomůcka, když chci mít přehled, kdo je nový a kdo se vrátil. Nejčastěji se lidi takhle vrací, když je Memberful vykopne kvůli tomu, že neměli včas zaplacené členství :) (třeba prošla karta)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Koukal jsem se na &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB31aubcjno"&gt;přednášku o juniorech&lt;/a&gt;. Vhodné především pro ty, co chtějí nějaké juniory zaměstnávat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Myslel jsem, že na Seznam nechodí aktivační maily z Memberful, tak jsem strávil nějakou tu hodinku na Memberful supportu, kde jsem zjišťoval, v čem je problém. Hlavně mě rozrušovalo, že člověk, kterému ten mail nedojde, se nedostane do účtu, protože nedávno odebrali přihlašování přes jméno a heslo a zavedli místo toho „magic link”. No, shrnu to asi tak, že jsou skvělí, jako vždycky. Hlavně v tom, jak mě dokázali uklidnit a vrátit z roviny emocí do roviny konstruktivních řešení :D Druhý den jsem se jim i trochu omluvil, protože sám vím, jaké to je být na user supportu, v Apiary jsem to dělal dost často. Napsali, že se není vůbec za co omlouvat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V klubu se rozběhly zajímavé diskuze o &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/topics/greenfox/"&gt;GreenFox Academy&lt;/a&gt; nebo o Unicorn University. Jen houšť!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Byla schůze výboru Pyvce. Únava pandemií kulminuje, chvíli jsem myslel, že se vůbec nesejdeme. Posunuli jsme termín členské schůze, aby nebyl už za týden. Ten původní jsme si nějak nedokázali potvrdit a nikomu o něm říct. Tak třeba napodruhé o něm někomu říct dokážeme… Bylo by fakt super, kdybychom to dokázali, naučili členy spolku volit a mohli už přesluhující výbor vyměnit, aby to dostalo novej vítr. Samozřejmě nepomáhá, že i zbytek Python komunity je teď v pandemickém spánku a nic se neděje, nejsou konference, není nic. Smíšené pocity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přidal jsem na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/club/"&gt;stránku klubu&lt;/a&gt; logo Frontendistů a aktualizoval logo DigiKoalice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1394272249142730762"&gt;Povedlo se mi zjistit, co za písničku mají na Rohlík supportu.&lt;/a&gt; Jednak je Rohlíkový Twitter support fakt super, jednak mám radost, protože na jedné párty jsme s kamarády na tuhle písničku tančili a jsem rád, že ji teď mám jako mp3. I když bylo dost těžké ji sehnat. Na Spotify to bylo šedé. Na Amazonu mi to nešlo ani za nic koupit, zkoušel jsem to asi 4x, asi musím být z US, nevím. Na iTunes to je, ale Apple všude tlačí Apple Music a prosekat se pralesem upoutávek na to, že určitě nechci iTunes, ale chci Apple Music, bylo dost těžké. Apple Music ani iTunes nepoužívám, takže mi trvalo půl hodiny klikání, než jsem pochopil, že písničku nejde koupit na webu, ale asi jen v tom programu na macOS. Ten jsem otevřel, ale nepochopil. Nakonec jsem písničku našel a musel jsem do nějakého super skrytého kontextového menu, abych ji mohl koupit. Koupení naštěstí proběhlo OK. Mám mp3! Snad v tom souboru není deset DRM a nezmizí mi za chvíli z disku, protože někdo někde něčemu nedá licenci, nebo protože se můj disk příliš dlouho nachází ve východní Evropě.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jak jsem tady nedávno psal, že mám pocit, že mi stagnuje přísun členů, tak od té doby mám zase dojem, že se s nimi roztrhl pytel, ani netuším, odkud vlastně všichni chodí :D Nestíhám je vítat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V klubu bylo tento týden dost živo, takže jsem strávil i dost času odpovídáním a čtením zpráv.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Komunikoval jsem s dvěma firmami, s kterými mám rozjednané členství v klubu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na JG přibyly dvě nové neplacené nabídky práce, konkrétně neplacené stáže. Zkontroloval jsem je a přidal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Šel jsem na antigenní test a pak k holičce. Hurá!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přemýšlel jsem ve sprše nad tím, že pokud budu příště dělat nějakou slevovou akci na členství v klubu, měl bych ji úzce cílit (např. dát nějaké vstupy přímo organizátorkám PyLadies v nějakém městě, aby udělali soutěž nebo to nějak rozdaly, případně dát vstupy podobným způsobem nějakému srazu, influencerovi, a tak). Nebo že bych měl využít aktuální členy a dát kupóny jim, ať je buď uplatní pro sebe, nebo pošlou někomu ze svých přátel. Nemám to ještě úplně domyšlené, ale líbí se mi to víc, než plošná sleva na 1. máje apod.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 4 dní od 18.5. do 21.5. jsem naběhal 18 km, při procházkách nachodil 2 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 4 hodiny a zdolal při tom 20 kilometrů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="co-planuji"&gt;Co plánuji&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#co-planuji" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tři věci, které bych chtěl zvládnout udělat příště:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dokončit všechny drobnosti, které souvisí s hodnotou klubu pro členy, případně ladit stránku pro akce v klubu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dokončit soutěž o lístky a naposledy propagovat konferu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dokončovat materiály spolu s Engetem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-co-vy"&gt;A co vy?&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#a-co-vy" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud byste čistě náhodou měli dojem, že jste oproti mě za uplynulý týden vůbec nic nestihli, tak mám pro vás skvělou zprávu! V klidu se na ten dojem &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/neni-to-zavod/"&gt;můžete vykašlat&lt;/a&gt;. Není zač!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="co-me-zaujalo"&gt;Co mě zaujalo&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#co-me-zaujalo" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když si něco přečtu nebo poslechnu a líbí se mi to, &lt;a href="https://getpocket.com/@honzajavorek"&gt;sdílím to na Pocketu&lt;/a&gt;. Od posledních poznámek jsem sdílel toto:&lt;/p&gt;

Pokud chcete umět najímat juniory, určitě si ji pusťte - spousta dobrých tipů (byť z oboru SRE, ale i tak, použitelné i jinde). Jednou bych na toto téma chtěl mít materiály i na JG.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://getpocket.com/redirect?&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fslatestarcodex.com%2F2013%2F03%2F07%2Fwe-wrestle-not-with-flesh-and-blood-but-against-powers-and-principalities%2F&amp;amp;h=c664f537783bad072ec4088b4aef3498030108bb85c3160caf035c873df23644"&gt;We Wrestle Not With Flesh And Blood, But Against Powers And Principalities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jsme jen loutky ve hře technologického pokroku, který přináší nové možnosti a nové problémy, na něž se následně jako společnost adaptujeme skrze progresivní nápady. Může vám být nepříjemné, že existuje feminismus, ale nezastavíte jej umlčením feministek. Museli byste vrátit technologický pokrok do 19. století, což není možné. Minulá uspořádání společnosti byla dobře přizpůsobena na tehdejší úroveň pokroku, dnes by zcela selhávala. Namlouvat si, že ne, je nostalgie a romantika.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Akorát že není pátek, je pondělí. Padesáté poznámky jsem nestihl napsat v pátek a o víkendu na to nějak nebyla chuť a čas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="audio-video"&gt;Audio video&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#audio-video" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S &lt;a href="https://coreskill.tech/"&gt;Danem Srbem&lt;/a&gt; jsme si jeden den spontánně zavolali, abychom si něco rychle řekli, ale vyústilo to v call na celé odpoledne, kde jsme řešili detaily nahrávání, učil mě pořádně ovládat a nastavovat &lt;a href="https://obsproject.com/"&gt;OBS&lt;/a&gt;, apod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Řešili jsme hlavně zvuk a to, aby se nestala stejná chyba, jako při AMA s Jirkou Psotkou. Nastavil jsem &lt;a href="https://obsproject.com/forum/threads/%E2%80%9Capple-vt-h264-hardware-encoder-unlocked-for-apple-silicon-m1.138433/"&gt;Apple VT H264 Hardware Encoder&lt;/a&gt;, který by měl být lepší pro M1, zvyšovali bitrate audia, koukali jsme na &lt;a href="https://www.izotope.com/en/learn/audio-dynamics-101-compressors-limiters-expanders-and-gates.html"&gt;různé filtry&lt;/a&gt;, které mi mohou pomoci ladit zvuk, předělali jsme způsob, jakým se posílá zvuk do &lt;a href="https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole/"&gt;BlackHole&lt;/a&gt;. Předtím jsem měl multi-output device, kde audio z počítače bylo nastaveno tak, aby šlo do něj. Z něj šlo do mých sluchátek a do černé díry, na které poslouchalo OBS. Teď to bude tak, že v Discordu nastavím výstup na černou díru a v OBS budu mít zapnutý odposlech, takže ve sluchátkách uslyším přímo to, co se nahrává (kromě sebe, protože slyšet se mluvit, zatímco mluvím, není moc užitečné). Také díky tomu můžu přímo v OBS nastavovat hlasitost svoji a zvuku z Discordu, aby byla stejná. Změny jsem si hned poznačil do &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/honzajavorek/b1a77651e566cb6405a131bbf1fb0692"&gt;svého seznamu úkonů&lt;/a&gt;. Zvažovali jsme i nahrávat do různých stop, aby šlo případně dělat postprocessing pro každý hlas zvlášť, ale nechci s tím trávit víc času, než je nutné. Bude muset stačit, že to nahraju na první dobrou prostě dobře.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dále jsem s Danem a bráchou a probíral mikrofony a sluchátka, poznačím si tady odkazy na věci, o kterých byla řeč:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://sluchatka.heureka.cz/sennheiser-pxc-550-ii-wireless/"&gt;Sennheiser PXC 550 II Wireless&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://sluchatka.heureka.cz/cooler-master-masterpulse-mh751/"&gt;Cooler Master MasterPulse MH751&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://kytary.cz/marantz-pro-podpack1/HN220994/"&gt;Marantz Pro Pod Pack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kupovat zatím nic nebudu, je to dost peněz. Možná ten mikrofon. Sluchátka mám blbá, ale to mi přijde zatím dost drahý špás na to, že pro výkon při přednáškách není tolik podstatný. Ale na běžné domácí poslouchání by se mi lepší hodily: ANC by bylo fajn, nicméně chci Bluetooth (na poslech při domácích pracech) i jack (na nahrávání přednášek) a hlavně aby mi neskřípaly moc hlavu, protože to ty moje teď dělají a moc dlouho v nich nevydržím.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan také pracoval na opravě zvuku u AMA s Jirkou Psotkou. Dohodli jsme se, že pokud to nepůjde automaticky, tak 2 hodiny záznamu ručně procházet nebude, řekne mi co a jak a já to jako dělník naklikám. Ale nakonec to udělal celé sám, za což bych mu chtěl ještě jednou velice poděkovat! V jednu chvíli mi poslal „opravený“ záznam, který jsme pak ale zjistili, že je nějaký vadný. Jenže mezitím jsem ho už nahrál na YouTube a dal členům klubu, takže pak jsme dělali ještě jedno kolečko. Trochu Pat a Mat, nicméně finální, třetí video je už opravdu to nejlepší, co z toho vyždímeme. Dali jsme tam i sekce, na které jde klikat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Záznamy běžně nikde neuveřejňuji, jsou jen pro členy klubu a jejich „kamarády“. To znamená, že je mohou volně poslat i někomu jinému, zhruba stejně, jako by odemykali článek v novinách za paywallem. AMA s Jirkou byla ale tak dobrá, že na ni &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-POZC63Chuk"&gt;dám odkaz i tady&lt;/a&gt;. Stejně ty moje grafomanské poznámky nikdo nečte, takže to nebude žádný velký leak. A kdo to čte, je můj kamarád. Asi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pokud to leak bude, aspoň lidi uvidí, co se v klubu odehrává a budou chtít do něj. Nebo budou chtít svou firmu prezentovat podobně a bude z toho další hezká AMA!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="umela-inteligence-pro-nabidky-prace"&gt;Umělá inteligence pro nabídky práce&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#umela-inteligence-pro-nabidky-prace" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nedávno jsem jel s &lt;a href="https://milavotradovec.cz/"&gt;Mílou&lt;/a&gt; na kole na výlet, abychom se domluvili, co dál s nabídkami práce. Plán byl, ale čekalo to na mě. Priorita to není, jenže když se čeká na maintainera moc dlouho, contributorům opadne nadšení a najdou si jiné vyžití. Machine learning se musí kout, dokud je Míla žhavý.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takže jsem se do toho pustil a připravil mu podhoubí pro jeho další změny. Vytvořil jsem tajnou místnost na Discordu, kam padají nabídky, na kterých se můj robot a Mílova ML magie neshodnou. Tam je můžu já a případně další dobrovolníci hodnotit pomocí palců nahoru dolu, jestli si myslíme, že jsou juniorní nebo ne. To bude zpětná vazba pro učení. Naprogramoval jsem posílání nabídek do místnosti a sosání palců zpět do databáze. Míla by to asi dokázal udělat taky, ale já už přesně věděl jak a co, protože jsem tyhle věci všechny nedávno dělal, takže jsem to měl docela rychle. Nejsem na to nějak hrdý, je to celkem naprasené, ale zatím to bude stačit a snad to zajistí, že Mílovo nadšení neuhasne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Následně vždy, když tam něco přibylo, tak jsem se to snažil poctivě rozklikávat a ohodnotit. Dobré je, že to jsou jen jednotky nebo desítky nabídek, takže je to v mých silách. Kdybych měl hodnotit vše, co můj robot vyřadí, tak to je třeba jen za dnešek 344 nabídek. To by mi trvalo projít celý den. To není odhad, to vím, protože když jsem robota programoval, tak jsem to fakt procházel a projít nízké stovky nabídek spolu s úpravami v robotovi mi trvalo zhruba jeden pracovní den.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Při rozklikávání nabídek jsem si všiml, že LinkedIn u některých ukazuje i osobu, která nabídku zadala. Proaktivně jsem si osoby vždy rozkliknul přidal si je, když už jsem se na danou nabídku koukal. Pokud si mě přidají, budou se jim zobrazovat moje statusy o JG a třeba z toho bude byznys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="generovani-plakatku"&gt;Generování plakátků&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#generovani-plakatku" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Začal jsem pracovat na automatizaci úkonů, které dělám kolem každé přednášky. Ideální bylo začít automatickými zprávami, které budou upozorňovat na blížící se přednášku, protože bych je hned vyzkoušel na úterní přednášce s Vildou. Jenže to se mi nechtělo, tak jsem pracoval na generování plakátků, které teď nutně nepotřebuji.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Díval jsem se, jak lze z HTML a CSS vygenerovat obrázek. Inspirovala mě k tomu zpráva, že Google Documents &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/05/Google-Docs-Canvas-Based-Rendering-Update.html"&gt;se budou nově renderovat přes canvas&lt;/a&gt;. Třeba existují nějaké voňavé nové technologie, které by mě zbavily nutnosti spouštět prohlížeč a dělat screenshot? Našel jsem &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/46243263/325365"&gt;tuto hezkou odpověď&lt;/a&gt;, kde je spousta nástrojů a API. Různé jsem zkoušel, ale nakonec jsem došel k tomu, že nic není rychlejší, lepší nebo jednodušší než to, co už používám na náhledy stránek (tzv. &lt;code&gt;og:image&lt;/code&gt;), tedy že vygeneruju HTML přes Jinja2 a uložím screenshot přes &lt;a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/pageres"&gt;pageres&lt;/a&gt;. Takže jsem si hezky početl a pohrál, ale používám dál to, co už jsem dávno měl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doplnil jsem &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/junior.guru/blob/master/juniorguru/data/events.yml"&gt;data o přednáškách&lt;/a&gt; tak, aby z nich šlo generovat plakáty. Ještě se z nich negeneruje ani &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/events/"&gt;tahle stránka&lt;/a&gt;, ale jednou určitě bude. Plakáty jsou zábavnější!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Začal jsem generovat HTML ze šablon, ale při tom jsem se rozhodl překopat půlku repozitáře, protože jsem najednou potřeboval tyto obrázky generovat v první fázi buildu webu, která pracuje jen s daty, ne během samotného sestavení stránek. Tu první fázi jsem přejmenoval z &lt;code&gt;fetch&lt;/code&gt; na &lt;code&gt;sync&lt;/code&gt;, protože mi přišlo, že už je tam hromada věcí, které nejen data stahují, ale i posílají, např. do Discordu. Mám ale pravidlo, že tam smí být jen věci, které jsou &lt;a href="https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence"&gt;idempotentní&lt;/a&gt;, což moje skripty nad Discordem zásadně jsou. Posílání e-mailů je jinde, aby se omylem třeba neodeslaly duplicitně. Taky jsem si konečně napsal ty dva řádky, které zajistí, že pokud chci spustit jen část z té první fáze, nemusím psát &lt;code&gt;pipenv run python -m juniorguru.fetch.stories&lt;/code&gt;, ale stačí &lt;code&gt;pipenv run sync stories&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Přehazoval jsem vidlema soubory sem a tam, protože jsem přemýšlel, kde bude nejlepší mít obrázky a kde styly, když už najednou nejsou záležitostí webu, ale i jiných částí JG. Připravil jsem si fotky speakerů a napsal skript, který je automaticky zmenší na požadovanou velikost, takže mi bude u nových stačit je oříznout na čtverec libovolné velikosti a hodit do složky. Stahování avatarů z Discordu pro speakery, kteří by svou fotku neměli, jsem zatím zavrhl jako YAGNI. Plakátky se generují hezky a generuju i čtvercové pro sdílení na Instagramu, což jsem doteď taky dělal ručně. Zatím to není nikde vidět a nemám to ostylované, takže to není hezké, ale základ funguje:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://junior.guru/static/images/posters/5f41c3bf961b1f2b4256fd5e5b1ea899db69f0770ca42bde719ad346502a2ff5.png"&gt;Vilda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://junior.guru/static/images/posters/5f41c3bf961b1f2b4256fd5e5b1ea899db69f0770ca42bde719ad346502a2ff5-ig.png"&gt;Vilda jako čtverec&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S tímto jsem v pátek skončil a myslel jsem si, že napíšu poznámky a bude hotovo. Jenže jsem pak objevoval spoustu drobných chyb, které jsem při těch velkých změnách ve struktuře projektu nadělal. Web JG třeba najednou neměl CSS. Postupně jsem je opravoval, ale narazil jsem na chybu, kterou jsem vyřešit neuměl. Chyběly některé obrázky. To jsem řešil následující 2 hodiny bez velkých úspěchů a než jsem si vytrhal všechny vlasy, opravil jsem to nakonec tím, že jsem downgradoval Flask z nové v2 na menší, což tedy byla věc, která se odehrála už před několika dny a s pátečním překopáním webu vůbec nesouvisela.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Downgrade Flasku samozřejmě neproběhl jen tak, protože &lt;code&gt;pipenv install&lt;/code&gt; si začalo najednou stěžovat na nějaký problém s kompilací SciPy. Musel jsem číst pomalu darknet, abych našel řešení, které zjevně na M1 je:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ brew install openblas gfortran
$ export OPENBLAS=$(/usr/local/bin/brew --prefix openblas)
$ export CFLAGS="-falign-functions=8 ${CFLAGS}"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pak teprve instalovat SciPy. Poté jsem mohl pokračovat debugováním původního problému. Naštěstí downgrade Flasku opravdu pomohl. Chyba je někde tam, Frozen-Flask asi nepočítá s některými změnami v novém Flasku, ale nešlo to naprvní pohled nijak vidět ani to nikde neskončilo chybou, pouze &lt;em&gt;občas&lt;/em&gt; zmizely &lt;em&gt;některé&lt;/em&gt; obrázky!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hned bych to nahlásil maintainerům Frozen-Flask, kdybych nebyl maintainerem Frozen-Flask. Bezmoc. Aspoň jsem to pak trochu zdokumentoval &lt;a href="https://github.com/Frozen-Flask/Frozen-Flask/issues/112#issuecomment-841629172"&gt;tady&lt;/a&gt;. Mimochodem zrovna tento týden se mi ozval nějaký člověk, který se chce stát maintainerem Frozen-Flask, tak jsem mu odepisoval, že na to nemám čas, stejně jako všichni maintaineři přede mnou, tak ať se klidně přidá. Možná bych se mohl pověnovat aspoň tomuto zákeřnému bugu a napsat na něj test nebo jej lépe zdokumentovat, uvidíme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když už jsem myslel, že jsem vše opravil, zjistil jsem, že jsem si sice hezky pohrál s CSS &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties"&gt;custom properties&lt;/a&gt; pro barvy, ale dal jsem je i do &lt;code&gt;linear-gradient()&lt;/code&gt;, kde mi nefungují pro hex čísla, do &lt;code&gt;rgba()&lt;/code&gt; musím dávat jednotlivé složky. Když jsem barvy měl původně v SCSS proměnných, fungovalo to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No jinými slovy, vše jsem rozbil a pak jsem to celý večer lepil a byl jsem následně zralý na velké klikání na &lt;a href="http://milujipraci.cz/"&gt;Miluji práci&lt;/a&gt;. Na poznámky nedošlo. Už jsem jen odpadl, pustili jsme si s investorkou seriál a šli spát. Super pátek. Naštěstí to vyvážila párty neděle, kdy se kamarádi stavili k nám na Žižkov na partičku &lt;a href="http://www.bang.cz/"&gt;Bangu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zjistil jsem, že i když nemám nějak extra boostnutý Discord server, v základu můžeme mít 50 custom emojis. Pár jsem jich přidal a to dále spustilo lavinu všelijakých požadavků na emoji :D Máme &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging"&gt;gumovou kachnu&lt;/a&gt; i hlavu &lt;a href="http://robweb.sk/"&gt;yablka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na &lt;a href="https://python.cz/"&gt;python.cz&lt;/a&gt; jsem opravil pokažený auto-deploy. Z nějakého důvodu se skriptu nedařilo přepsat &lt;code&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; větev, tak jsem zkusil nějaký nový GitHub token a ještě jsem větev ručně smazal a vyrobil znova. To zabralo ¯\_(ツ)_/¯&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Člen klubu nasdílel &lt;a href="https://github.com/SveterCZE/justice"&gt;svůj projekt&lt;/a&gt;, kde si hraje s daty ze státních rejstříků. Prošel jsem jej, nainstaloval, stáhl data, napsal mu na to poctivě feedback, to mi zabralo tak hodinu nejmíň.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Díval jsem se na &lt;a href="https://cesko.digital/show-and-tell"&gt;Show &amp;amp; Tell&lt;/a&gt; Česko.Digital. To mi připomenulo, že jsem chtěl dodělat API na pracovní nabídky. Otevřel jsem &lt;a href="https://github.com/cesko-digital/cd-tools/pull/9"&gt;PR s otázkami ohledně dokumentace&lt;/a&gt;. Taky jsem si vzpomněl, že jsme chtěli na blogu Česko.Digital vydat článek o tom, jak se může juniorka zapojit, ale ten někde uvízl ve schvalovacím procesu. Šťouchl jsem do toho opět, ale zatím bez výsledku. Je to škoda, protože pokud to chápu dobře, tak už je připravený a napsaný. Holt budu čekat dál. Nechci zas lidi moc otravovat a stále to připomínat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Naplánoval jsem zase nějaké statusy na sociální sítě.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pročetl jsem příběhy o career switchers na blogu Mews a všechny tři se mi nakonec líbily: &lt;a href="https://developers.mews.com/a-different-kind-of-magic-mike/"&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://developers.mews.com/meet-the-mewsdevs-daria/"&gt;Daria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://developers.mews.com/marketa-linguist-who-found-love-in-sql-and-portugal/"&gt;Markéta&lt;/a&gt;. Přidal jsem je na JG. Pokud máte nějaké další příběhy a nejste vzdělávací agentura, sem s nimi! Success stories vzdělávacích agentur nepřebírám v rámci nezávislosti, byť nijak nechci umenšit autentičnost jednotlivých životních příběhů a povedených kariérních změn, příběhy v režii agentur jsou psány s určitým zadáním. Pokud je to ale na blogu firmy, kterou neživí kurzy, tak v pohodě.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přišel inzerát prácovní nabídky, takže jsem ho přidal a vyfakturoval. Jupí!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volal jsem si s právničkou a vymysleli jsme spolu, jak upravíme obchodní podmínky. Poslal jsem jí pak nějaké dokumenty a prý to bude další týden hotové. Uvažoval jsem, zda místo kupónu neřešit zpětné proplácení členství vzdělávacími agenturami přes speciální typ předplatného, ale nakonec jsem zůstal u kupónů, protože jinak, pokud by členům vypršelo proplacené předplatné, nemohli by tak snadno přejít na předplatné, které si platí sami. Když je to přes kupón, stačí když zadají kartu a jedou dál za svoje.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V souvislosti s tím jsem si psal s Memberful supportem a snažil se lépe pochopit to, jak fungují kupóny, protože jsem některé věci nechápal. Samozřejmě mají všechno v &lt;a href="https://memberful.com/help/how-to/create-a-coupon/"&gt;dokumentaci&lt;/a&gt;, ale chtěl jsem jim dát trochu i zpětnou vazbu, jak jsou některé věci neintuitivní nebo i matoucí.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Levels na remoteok.io &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1391701746615918595"&gt;změnil chování API&lt;/a&gt;, což rozbilo můj scraper. Nevím, k čemu je dobré, že jeho JSON umí detekovat robota na náhledy a v takovém případě vrátí HTML, jestli je to nějaké lepší SEO, ale jako člověku, který trochu rozumí API, mi to přijde jako velké kacířství. Dobré bylo, že přímo v HTTP odpovědi bylo aspoň hned napsáno, jak to mohu opravit: &lt;em&gt;Getting this page as an API reply? Make sure your User Agent string does not contain the words "bot" or "google". Or add ?api=1 to force the JSON reply.&lt;/em&gt; Scraper jsem tedy opravil. Můj &lt;code&gt;User-Agent&lt;/code&gt; je standardně &lt;code&gt;JuniorGuruBot (+https://junior.guru)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V robotovi na pracovní nabídky jsem opravil chybu, která u některých nabídek odkazovala přímo na „apply“ formulář místo na popis nabídky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ČSFD mají novou verzi webu, takže už mi zhruba týden nefungovalo přidávání filmů do Trella přes &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/film2trello"&gt;film2trello&lt;/a&gt;. Opravil jsem to a smazal spoustu kódu, protože teď je přímo na stránce s filmem i odkaz na Aerovod, takže nemusím zvlášť scrapovat katalog Aerovodu a párovat filmy. Občas nicméně přidání filmu timeoutuje, protože scrapnutí stránky a interakce s Trello API trvá a děje se to všechno během requestu, zatímco Vercel, kde to jede, má pro free uživatele limit &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/film2trello/issues/57"&gt;jen 10s&lt;/a&gt;. Řešit jiné cloudy kvůli takové blbosti se mi nechce. Prostě to bude timeoutovat, pokud to bude trvat dlouho ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Dost často to dlouho netrvá a funguje to správně.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aby nebylo málo změn v repozitáři JG, které mohou něco rozbít, sloučil jsem build steps pro linter a testy. Samozřejmě to rozbilo minimálně seznam build steps, které když projdou, tak na základě nich GitHub považuje Pull Request za zelený bez ohledu na to, jak dopadly ty ostatní build steps (vhodné např. pokud chci kontrolovat rozbité odkazy, ale nechci, aby se kvůli nim nemergnul Pull Request od dependabotu).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Narazil jsem na Open Source alternativu ke &lt;a href="https://docs.xz.style/fonts/"&gt;Google Fonts&lt;/a&gt;. Sympatické! Bohužel (?) na JG nemám jediný custom font, takže zatím nevyužiju. Moje fonty nikoho netrackují a načtou se okamžitě.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skript, který stahuje a analyzuje zprávy na Discordu, se mi rozbil, protože jsem přidal private místnost na nabídky práce, kam nemá můj bot přístup. Uvědomil jsem si, že to nemám moc dobře vyřešené, že by měl takové věci umět sám přeskakovat a číst jen místa, kde je public přístup. Skript jsem upravil. Bohužel to nejde udělat jednodušeji, než kontrolovat oprávnění u každého kanálu, ale aspoň to nejsou další API cally, jde to pomocí &lt;a href="https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py"&gt;discord.py&lt;/a&gt; zjistit z už dostupných dat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Udělal jsem první promo na &lt;a href="https://frontendisti.cz/konference"&gt;konferenci Frontendistů&lt;/a&gt;, ale ještě budu dělat další. Asi bude i překvapení pro členy klubu, ale musím ho domyslet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Propagoval jsem &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/events/#planned"&gt;přednášku s Vilibaldem Wančou o „životě HTTP požadavku“&lt;/a&gt;, která bude zítra.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chtěl jsem už konečně začít pracovat na materiálu, který připravujeme společně s Engetem, ale úspěšně jsem to prokrastinoval. Jenže jsem koukal, že ani oni nic nemají, tak že asi dobrý. V pátek přišel status check, jestli stíhám, že oni si to připravují v dokumentu vedle a do toho společného dají jen věci, kterým mám udělat review :D Takže fail, nestíhám a jsem pozadu. Každopádně jsem ještě v pátek i přes debugování všeho, co se mi na webu rozbilo, stihl do dokumentu dát aspoň základní draft odstavců, na kterých budu dál pracovat. Nejtěžší je začít, že? Tak jsem začal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vyprší mi lítačka a vlastně nevím, jestli chci novou, nebo ne. Mám pocit, že jsem nikam rok nejezdil a když už jsem někam jel, tak na kole. Bydlím na místě, kde vše zařídím pěšky. Zkusím to bez lítačky a nechám se překvapit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 10 dní od 8.5. do 17.5. jsem naběhal 26 km, při procházkách nachodil 37 km, na túrách nachodil 1 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 17 hodin a zdolal při tom 64 kilometrů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="co-planuji"&gt;Co plánuji&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#co-planuji" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tři věci, které bych chtěl zvládnout udělat příště:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pracovat na materiálu, který připravujeme společně s Engetem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přednáška s Vildou, automatizovat dál věci kolem přednášek.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promovat dál &lt;a href="https://frontendisti.cz/konference"&gt;konferu Frontendistů&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus:&lt;/strong&gt; Shánět někoho dalšího na přednášku, ale možná si dám i chvilku pauzu, ať stíhám dělat i jiné věci. Chlapů mám pár v zásobě, bral bych spíš ženy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-co-vy"&gt;A co vy?&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#a-co-vy" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud byste čistě náhodou měli dojem, že jste oproti mě za uplynulý týden vůbec nic nestihli, tak mám pro vás skvělou zprávu! V klidu se na ten dojem &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/neni-to-zavod/"&gt;můžete vykašlat&lt;/a&gt;. Není zač!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="majova-sleva"&gt;Májová sleva&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#majova-sleva" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Májová sleva na klub dopadla tak, že se zaregistrovalo celkem 10 nových lidí. To nebylo špatné. Zřejmě to dost zregulovalo to, že byl víkend, státní svátek a minimálně v pátek i docela hezké počasí. Kupón jsem nakonec nechal funkční až do pondělí, zaregistrovali se ještě 3 opozdilci. Myslím, že ze všeho nejvíc to byl test mojí bubliny na sociálních sítích a toho, zda lidi vidí nějakou hodnotu v klubu z toho, co je o něm vidět za informace zvenku.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Příště bych měl ale slevy dělat spíš s nějakou promyšlenou strategií. Našel jsem si k tomu &lt;a href="http://blog.karsa-monitor.cz/nas-zakaznik-nas-pan-potrebuje-slevy-jak-na-ne/"&gt;tento článek&lt;/a&gt;, ale ještě nečetl. Také jsem přemýšlel, že bych mohl ty kupóny sdílet v proužku na webu, jako to dělají eshopy, které jsem v poslední době viděl (např. Bonami, Zalando), a ne jen na sociálních sítích.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cenik-pro-firmy"&gt;Ceník pro firmy&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#cenik-pro-firmy" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jsem v kontaktu s jednou firmou a napadlo mě, že už se mi v hlavě celkem poskládalo, jak by měl vypadat budoucí nový ceník pro firmy. Byli jsme domluvení, že jim pošlu do mailu nabídku, tak jsem to vzal jako příležitost a velkou část pondělí jsem tvořil nový ceník. &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1keFyO5aavfaNfJkKlyYha4B-UbdnMja6AhprS_76E7c/edit?usp=sharing"&gt;Udělal jsem ho jednoduše v Google Dokumentech&lt;/a&gt; a možná jej hodím na web prostě takhle, než se to úplně ustálí, abych se nekódoval s HTML a pak to složitě nepředělával. Nechal jsem se trochu inspirovat i &lt;a href="https://cz.pycon.org/2019/static/pyconcz-2019-sponsorship-prospectus.324aa2019692.pdf"&gt;prospektem pro sponzory PyCon CZ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Četl jsem si trochu o pricingu a zkusil jsem nějaké triky z &lt;a href="https://www.ilincev.com/38-tipu-jak-zvolit-a-prezentovat-cenu"&gt;tohoto článku&lt;/a&gt;, ale ne zas moc, nechci, abych působil jako podomní prodejce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nový ceník nemám kupodivu klasicky jako tři možnosti levná/střední/drahá, protože mi přišlo, že to vlastně nesedí na to, s čím za mnou firmy chodí. Každá je trochu jiná. Takže jsem to zkusil udělat tak, že je nějaký základ, placené partnerství, a na něj lze vršit různé balíčky navíc dle libosti. Díval jsem se, jak to má řešené Levels &lt;a href="https://remoteok.io/hire-remotely"&gt;tady&lt;/a&gt;. Hodně se mi líbí, že má u těch upsell možností vždy napsáno „2x more views“ apod., takže kupující hned vidí hodnotu, jakou dostane. Jenže nic takto přímočarého jsem u svých balíčků zatím vymyslet nedokázal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nabidky-prace"&gt;Nabídky práce&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#nabidky-prace" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tento týden jsem odmítl dvě nabídky přidané na JG, protože nebyly dost juniorní. Byly zadány jako komunitní, takže mě to nemrzí, jelikož nepřicházím o peníze, ale vlastně mrzí, protože přicházím o čas. Tohle neškáluje. Každou ručně zadanou nabídku musím přečíst, zvážit, naformátovat do Markdownu. Ano, jednu nebo dvě nabídky jsem taky přidal, ale ty byly teda taky zadarmo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hezký den,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;díky za zaslanou nabídku práce. Pročetl jsem ji a obratem bych ji uveřejnil, pokud by šlo změnit požadavek na „Velmi dobrou znalost JavaScriptu, HTML a CSS“, například na „Znalost JavaScriptu, HTML a CSS“. Pracovní nabídky na junior.guru se zaměřují na entry level juniory, takže je velmi nepravděpodobné, že někdo z nich bude velmi dobrou znalost mít. Pokud to není typ kandidátů, které byste přijali, tak by nabídku asi mělo větší smysl inzerovat např. na https://www.startupjobs.cz/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Díky,
Honza Javorek&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://junior.guru/
https://honzajavorek.cz/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Přemýšlím, jak toto řešit. Přijde mi, že se s firmou buď neshodnu na tom, kdo je junior, nebo tu komunitní možnost využívají firmy na své nabídky s tím, že je to zadarmo, tak o nic nejde a pošlou tam cokoliv, hlavně aby se to někde uveřejnilo a někdo to přečetl. Jak moc se navíc některé ty firmy kvalifikují na onu komunitní možnost, to nevím. Občas napíšou, že třeba spolupracují s PyLadies, nebo jde vidět, že to je fakt malá firma, ale někdy fakt nevím a říkám si, tyjo, to nepustí ani pětikilo za inzerát?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mám z toho smíšené pocity, tím spíš, že nabídky teď nejsou můj primární zdroj příjmů. Ano, 500 Kč je pořád jako zhruba 5 členů v klubu za měsíc, na zemi to neleží, ale v současné chvíli to začíná mít velkou režii na to, že to pomalu ani těch 500 Kč nevydělá. Zároveň chci zachovat možnost přidat nabídku, protože chci, aby nebylo drahé poptávat juniory. Nejlevnější nabídka na StartupJobs stojí 1500 Kč a já chci, aby na JG mohl přidat stáž nebo nějakou brigádu fakt kdokoliv. Navíc jsem od začátku domluvený s PyLadies, že když někdo pošle nabídku jim, na JG ji uveřejním zadarmo. Jenže teď mi přijde, že firmy tu komunitní možnost spíš zneužívají, nebo prostě není dost jasné, co tam ne/mají zadávat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nápady, co můžu udělat:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přidat do formuláře checkbox, kde budou muset odsouhlasit, že nabídka je fakt pro entry level uchazeče, aby si to uvědomili, než to pošlou.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přidat do formuláře políčko, kam musí napsat, co je kvalifikuje na komunitní variantu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dát vkládání všech nabídek zadarmo. Naučit třídícího robota rozpoznat text nabídky na prakticky jakékoliv stránce. Umožnit zadávání nabídek jen skrz URL, ne zadáváním textu a vyplňováním formuláře. Robot si URL stáhne, najde text nabídky, vyhodnotí její junioritu a pošle inzerentům verdikt mailem, proti kterému se mohou odvolat tím, že na mail odepíšou. Pokud chci nabídku uveřejnit i přes robotův nesouhlas, označím ji v tabulce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poslední možnost se mi líbí a škáluje, ale má problém v tom, že je to spousta programování něčeho, co nepřináší peníze a zároveň mi ubyde věc, kterou mohu prodávat firmám. Ale těm asi můžu prodávat společné sepsání hezké nabídky, konzultaci, &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/215426887eaaad9105ecf647d0ff24cf94de7c9eb47cc6f2c55e6921/"&gt;paušální permanentní nabídku&lt;/a&gt;… to se asi dá řešit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="stagnace-rustu-poctu-clenu"&gt;Stagnace růstu počtu členů?&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#stagnace-rustu-poctu-clenu" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Přemýšlel jsem spolu s kamarádem nad jeho i nad svým byznysem. Jeho byznys jsme probrali a došli k tomu, že musí držet focus na ty nejdůležitější věci, neodbíhat od nich a dělat to, co ví, že má udělat. Můj byznys se má tak, že tabulka vykazuje, že mám zhruba 21000 Kč měsíčně čistý příjem. Jenže se toto číslo moc nehýbe. Přemýšlel jsem s tím kamarádem i s investorkou, co se děje:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nemám chybu v tabulce a ve výpočtech? (To je dost možné, ale nestihl jsem to zkontrolovat. Našel jsem zatím jen jednu chybu, a to že se vrácené peníze z ČSSZ a VZP započítaly jako špatně kategorizované příjmy, to jsem opravil.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uzavírám partnerství s firmami, ale přijde mi, že sotva nějaké uzavřu, už abych hledal nové, protože uplyne měsíc a strhnou se zase zálohy apod., vše se zase přepočítá a výsledkem je stejný příjem jako předtím.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Najdou lidi klub? (Snad jo, ale marketing mimo bublinu mám teď chabý.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chtějí lidi do klubu? (Těžko říct, osobně si myslím, že &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/club/"&gt;stránku klubu&lt;/a&gt; už je potřeba předělat, aby lépe informovala o tom, co v klubu lidi najdou, lépe vysvětlila hodnotu klubu, aby tam byly všechny novinky, atd. Mohlo by to podstatně zlepšit konverze.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uživatelé mají vždy 2 týdny, než začnou platit, takže je to jak s koronavirem, nikdy úplně přesně nevím, na čem jsem, je to o dva týdny posunuté.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odchází lidi? (Zdá se, že moc ne. Nějaká retence je přirozená, je otázka jak velkou bych teď měl mít, ale osobně si myslím, že to není teď ten hlavní problém.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Partnerství s firmama stále přibývají a spousta věcí je rozjednaných. Možná stačí počkat a nebýt tak hrr a chtít všechno hned?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud bych měl 12 firem (zhruba 12x10000 Kč za rok), mám 10000 Kč měsíčně jistých. K tomu MRR z členů klubu, stačilo by zhruba 200 platících, abych měl dohromady 30000 Kč čistého. Potom bych prohlásil, že mě JG uživí, očekával postupný posun na 35000 (průměrná hrubá mzda v ČR) a začal se zase zabývat i věcma, které nemusí nutně vydělávat peníze. Na takových číslech teď nejsem, ale zdaleka mi to nepřijde nemožné. Myslím, že jsem rozhodně na dobré cestě. Možná by mi k lepšímu pocitu pomohlo, kdybych měl konkrétnější plán co se týče marketingu, věděl kolik mi má přibýt lidí za měsíc nebo kolik mám uzavřít firemních partnerství a nějak lépe bych viděl, jestli jsem nad plán nebo pod plán? Nemůžu jenom dělat věci tak, jak přicházejí a spoléhat se na to, že směr je dobrý a dříve či později se na požadovaný měsíční příjem dostanu. Nebo můžu? Aby se to taky nestalo až za pět roků, když budu mít pomalé tempo…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Věc, ke které jsme došli a kterou bych měl rozhodně udělat, je napsat lidem. Napsat soukromé zprávy lidem v klubu, ptát se jich, jak mě našli, co se jim v klubu nejvíc líbí, nelíbí, co jim tam chybí, jak jim jinak můžu pomoct, atd. Dokud neudělám tuhle mravenčí práci, nevím nic a můžu sice koukat na čísla, ale čísla jsou taky jenom čísla, nemají kontext. Když budu vědět co se ne/líbí lidem v klubu, budu navíc vědět co přidat, nebo co vyzdvihnout na nové &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/club/"&gt;stránce lákající na klub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mezitím se do konce týdne do klubu přidali další noví lidé, kteří ani nevím, jak klub našli :D Takže je otázka, jaká to je potom stagnace. Jestli je reálná, nebo je to jen chyba v mé hlavě a k tomu třeba i v excelové tabulce. Taky si musím připomínat, že tohle všechno mám za 3 měsíce provozu klubu. Mě to přijde jako věčnost, ale ve skutečnosti je to samozřejmě skvělý výkon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="role-v-klubu-a-vyber-toho-nej-za-posledni-tyden"&gt;Role v klubu a výběr toho nej za poslední týden&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#role-v-klubu-a-vyber-toho-nej-za-posledni-tyden" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Už minulý týden jsem přidal bota, který přiděluje role členům v klubu na základě jejich aktivity. Tento týden jsem kód pročistil, předělal a hlavně otestoval a vychytal nějaké hraniční případy. Taky jsem ladil seznam kanálů, které se berou v úvahu pro počítání hodnocených příspěvků, některé jsem ještě přidal do seznamu ignorovaných.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dále jsem naprogramoval věc, která projde zprávy za poslední týden a vyhodnotí, které byly nejvíc pozitivně hodnoceny. Z toho se pak poskládá výběr toho nej za poslední týden a posílá se to do kanálu s oznámeními, momentálně by se tak mělo dít každý pátek. Výroba tohoto nebyla nakonec moc složitá. Některé části jsem trochu naprasil, ale zdá se, že to funguje, tak se to zatím přežije. Naučil jsem se, jak lze v Discord příspěvku udělat odkazy pomocí Markdownu (lze to jen botem, v description pro Embed). Zjistil jsem, že by bylo dobré vidět začátek příspěvku, takže jsem použil &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/textwrap.html#textwrap.shorten"&gt;textwrap.shorten()&lt;/a&gt; ze standardní knihovny na zkrácení textu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hodně jsem si hrál s tím, jak výsledek vypadá, aby byl jednak užitečný a jednak nevzbuzoval špatné konotace. Např. jsem původně myslel, že tam budou emoji s medailema, ale pak jsem to zavrhl a udělal jen seznam, protože nechci v členech vzbuzovat soutěživost, spíš kooperaci a „vzájemné předávání díků“. Taky každá zpráva obsahuje vysvětlení, jak se seznam tvoří a jak mohou lidé hlasovat pod příspěvky pomocí reakcí s emoji, a tím děkovat autorům užitečných zpráv. Zároveň se nejvíc pozitivně hlasované zprávy zobrazí v tom výčtu, takže to pomůže těm, kdo nemají čas si číst klub každý den důkladně, ale nakouknou jednou za týden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myslím, že přesně něco takového v klubu chybělo. Např. lidi, kteří hledali práci a potom ji našli, jsou zasypáni úkoly a učením v nové práci a vůbec nemají čas klub číst. Chtějí ale zůstat v kontaktu. Tyto týdenní výčty by mohly pomoct s tím, aby o nic důležitého nepřišli. Uvidíme, jak to bude fungovat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="prednasky-do-yamlu"&gt;Přednášky do YAMLu&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#prednasky-do-yamlu" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Už mě nebaví dělat kolem přednášek vše ručně a začíná toho být nějak moc. Také už jich dost proběhlo, takže vím, co vše to obnáší a jak různorodá data se mohou objevit. Nejvyšší čas automatizovat. Začal jsem tím, že jsem přednášky přepsal z &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/junior.guru/blob/master/juniorguru/web/templates/events.html"&gt;tohoto HTML souboru&lt;/a&gt; do &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/junior.guru/blob/master/juniorguru/data/events.yml"&gt;tohoto YAML souboru&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pak soubor čtu přes &lt;a href="https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/"&gt;strictyaml&lt;/a&gt; a ukládám do SQLite. Následně chci přednášky do HTML dynamicky vypisovat a třeba si i generovat plakátky apod., ale to ještě nemám. Jediné, co jsem zatím udělal, je to, že se lidem na Discordu přiřadí nová, modře obarvená role „Mám přednášku“, pokud měli v historii přednášku, nebo se s nimi přednáška plánuje. Je to malé poděkování za to, že si něco připravili, zároveň to může pomoci ostatním je rozeznat, kdyby jim chtěli poslat dotaz apod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ama-s-jirkou-psotkou"&gt;AMA s Jirkou Psotkou&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#ama-s-jirkou-psotkou" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do posledního dne jsem nevěděl, jestli budou nějaké otázky na AMA, ale pak někdo prorazil mlčení a spustilo se otázek milion. Poučení je prorazit mlčení sám, nebo někoho instruovat, aby jej prorazil. Nemusel jsem si tedy prakticky připravovat svoje otázky, ale tak pár jsem jich doplnil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMA byla strašně super. Přišla hromada lidí. Jirku jsme grilovali 2 hodiny a úžasně odpovídal na všelijaké dotazy, bylo to boží. Například:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Je lepší začít hodně dole s nějakou stáží a podobně, nebo raději mít nastudováno a zkusit naskočit co nejvýš?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kolik bylo let nejmladšímu juniorovi bez praxe, kterého jsi přijímal, a naopak kolik bylo let nejstaršímu?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jak to máte s juniory na full remote? Jsem z druhého konce republiky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Očekáváš nějakou zkušenost s Open Source?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Co bývá v prvních měsících pro nově nastupující juniory nejtěžší? A co pro ty, co je zaškolují a věnují se jim?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uvádět do životopisu netechnické vzdělání nebo neuvádět žádné?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Co děláte v případě, když si kandidát řekne o míň peněz?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jaké je typické zvýšení mzdy juniora a kdy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proč firmy nezaměstnávají zaměstnance na zkrácené úvazky?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Když procházíš CV, co bys určil jako takový jeden největší nebo tři největší nešvary, které ti brání efektivně se jimi probrat a vyhodnotit kandidáta?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jak bys popsal potřebnou úroveň angličtiny?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;O jakou mzdu si mám říct jako junior?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jaký je poměr v týmech mezi seniory a juniory, jakou pozornost může junior očekávat, když nastoupí?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ještě jednou to napíšu: PERFEKTNĚ SE TO POVEDLO. Až na jednu věc. Úplně jsem pokazil záznam. Nastavoval jsem si nahrávání na poslední chvíli a musel jsem někde udělat chybu, nebo muselo něčemu někde vadit pořadí toho, jak jsem věci zapnul (většinou nastavuji &lt;a href="https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole/"&gt;BlackHole&lt;/a&gt; a až potom zapínám OBS a Discord, teď jsem to nějak zmatlal napřeskáčku), každopádně je na záznamu Jiří strašně potichu a já strašně nahlas a je to naprosto nepoužitelné. O to víc, že se večer tak povedl, mě teď mrzí, že se nepovedl ten záznam. Plánuji ještě zkusit nějak to audio upravit, třeba ručně pozesilovat co půjde, ale je to velké zklamání a chyba na mé straně. Nicméně záznam jsem nahrál jako unlisted video na YT a pár lidí, kteří se nemohli dostavit, si to pustilo a zvuk přetrpělo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Další poznatek byl, že AMA v pohodě fungovala na bázi psaní otázek do chatu a poslouchání, takže by se na ni dala využít clubhousová funkce Discordu, &lt;a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500005513722-Stage-Channels-FAQ"&gt;stage&lt;/a&gt;. To jsem si uvědomil ve chvíli, kdy se připojovali lidé nechtěně se zapnutým mikrofonem a rušili probíhající akci. Nic vážného, ale na té stage by to bylo víc v pohodě. Byl bych tam já jako předčítač otázek a Jirka jako odpovídač a kdo by chtěl mluvit, mohl by „zvednout ruku“. A možná by to takhle mohlo fungovat i na přednášky a ne jenom na AMA?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co se týče experimentu s FB událostí, nemyslím si, že měla výrazný efekt. I když jsem pozval celou JG skupinu na FB, kde je přes 700 lidí, nakliklo se snad 5 lidí, které všechny osobně znám nebo jsou už v klubu. Takže FB události asi dělat nebudu. Jsem rád, že jsem to neprogramoval a vyzkoušel to nejdřív vytvořit ručně.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Narazil jsem na &lt;a href="https://simpleanalytics.com/"&gt;SimpleAnalytics&lt;/a&gt; a zjistil jsem, že nejsou zas tak drahé: 500 Kč měsíčně, při platbě za rok dokonce jen 230 Kč měsíčně. Zatím do toho nejdu, platím jen zcela nezbytné věci, ale mít do budoucna privacy-first analytics místo Google Analytics, to by bylo super. Pod &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1389141552975450119"&gt;tweetem&lt;/a&gt; mi lidi posílali ještě další tipy na podobné služby. Nevím jak ty další služby, ale SimpleAnalytics na webu tvrdí, že má podporu i pro eventy. To by pokrylo vše, co potřebuji.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Se vzdělávací agenturou jsme dospěli k dohodě, ale ještě musím upravit smlouvu, aby podchycovala to, co jsme si dohodli, tedy že budou posílat absolventy do klubu a proplácet jim členství. Mám &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/tos/"&gt;obchodní podmínky&lt;/a&gt;, ale ty toto neřeší. Asi bych mohl sepsat speciální smlouvu, ale vzhledem k tomu, že chci toto běžně nabízet, rozhodl jsem se, že podmínky doplním. Napsal jsem právničce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opravil jsem vizuální bug toho, jak se na mobilu zobrazoval a zalamoval text pod hlavama členů klubu na webu JG.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psal jsem na dvě neziskovky, abychom uzavřeli partnerství a firmy případně mohly proplácet členství v klubu za lidi, které by doporučili. Zatím bez odpovědi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pomáhal jsem AutoMatu s uveřejněním nabídek práce, &lt;a href="https://auto-mat.cz/o-nas/pracujte-pro-automat#programator"&gt;hledají lidi&lt;/a&gt; a to i klidně juniorní. Taky hledají někoho, kdo se vyzná v AWS a pomohl by jim lépe nastavit služby, které u AWS používají.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odepisoval jsem za Pyvec někomu, kdo hledal pythonistu. Pokud hledáte pythonisty, návod je &lt;a href="https://python.cz/prace/#nabidka"&gt;tady&lt;/a&gt;. Pokud hledáte juniorní pythonisty, dejte to na JG.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zašel jsem si pro novou občanku. Zjistil jsem, že to funguje stejně jako pošta, pokud přijdu před obědem, čekám 3 minuty. Pokud po obědě, čekám 3 hodiny. Tentokrát jsem přišel před obědem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odpověděl jsem některým lidem po delší době na maily. Jiným lidem jsem odpověděl, že jim nestíhám odpovědět, ale určitě jim někdy odpovím.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dal jsem si cyklistický meeting s &lt;a href="https://milavotradovec.cz/"&gt;Mílou&lt;/a&gt;, abychom se domluvili na dalším postupu ohledně třízení nabídek práce na JG pomocí ML.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zjišťoval jsem, jestli může Discord bot někomu poslat soukromou zprávu tak, jako bych to byl já a ne jako by to byl ten bot. Chtěl jsem to použít na uvítací zprávu novým členům, na kterou kdyby odepsali, tak už bych mohl reagovat jako živá osoba. Pokud zprávu pošle bot, je to trochu neosobní a hlavně, když mu odepíšou, přijde to do zpráv jemu a ne mně. Výsledek asi hodinového bádání je, že to nejde. Na Redditu mi &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/n5dexp/how_to_send_an_automated_dm_message_as_me_not_as/"&gt;zprávu&lt;/a&gt; smazali, že tam nepatří, tak jsem hledal, kam patří. Našel jsem Discord o Discordu a &lt;a href="https://discord.com/channels/613425648685547541/697489244649816084/839461668445749289"&gt;tam jsem se zeptal&lt;/a&gt;, odpovědí bylo, že automatizovat zprávy, které vypadají jako od člověka, je proti ToS. Což mě teda přivádí na myšlenku, že když je něco proti ToS, tak to znamená, že tomu nelze technicky zabránit :D Ale „nelze technicky zabránit“ a „lze udělat přes API“ je velký rozdíl. Dál to nehodlám řešit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pracovní nabídky poslané přímo na JG schvaluji tak, že k nim do Google Sheetu zadám datum schválení. Bohužel jsem se ale u dvou spletl a napsal místo 2021 rok 2020. Nabídky to místo schválení vyhazovalo z výpisu jako prošlé, ale já si toho vůbec nevšiml. Dnes jsem to zjistil, inzerentům se omluvil a datum opravil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psal mi týpek, který se přeučuje z geodeta na programátora. Na takové konzultace po mailech teď už nemívám moc čas odpovídat. Věnuju se lidem v klubu, takže pokud máte podobný dotaz, přidejte se do klubu (prvních 14 dní zadarmo…) a dotaz položte tam. Aspoň si to přečte víc lidí a mohou si z toho taky něco vzít. Nebo vám odpovím v soukromé zprávě, ale aspoň budu vědět, že jste vstoupili do klubu a existuje nenulová šance, že se vám tam zalíbí a zůstanete :) Nicméně jsem teda po asi dvou týdnech, co to na mě svítilo v inboxu, konečně odpověděl. Podle mě už toho uměl tolik, že by si dávno mohl sehnat první práci jako programátor :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Začal jsem už domlouvat další přednášku: &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/events/#planned"&gt;Život HTTP požadavku&lt;/a&gt;. Vytvořil jsem už i plakátek a záznam na stránce s akcemi, ale propagovat budu přednášku až příští týden. Věci kolem přednášky dělám zase komplet ručně, nestihl jsem zatím automatizovat nic, co by mi reálně s něčím pomohlo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 7 dní od 1.5. do 7.5. jsem naběhal 11 km, při procházkách nachodil 11 km, ujel na kole 34 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 13 hodin a zdolal při tom 56 kilometrů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tři věci, které bych chtěl zvládnout udělat příště:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Začít pracovat na materiálu, který připravujeme společně s Engetem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatizovat věci kolem přednášek.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promovat Vildovu přednášku.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pokud byste čistě náhodou měli dojem, že jste oproti mě za uplynulý týden vůbec nic nestihli, tak mám pro vás skvělou zprávu! V klidu se na ten dojem &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/neni-to-zavod/"&gt;můžete vykašlat&lt;/a&gt;. Není zač!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;V úterý se odehrála posunutá přednáška Adiny Foxové. Před přednáškou jsem dojel svůj &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/honzajavorek/b1a77651e566cb6405a131bbf1fb0692"&gt;přednáškový checklist&lt;/a&gt; a navíc ještě znova všude upozornil, že to bude. Přednáška byla moc fajn a dokonce po ní živelně vznikla delší diskuze na různá témata, takže super. Vše se mi opět povedlo nahrát pro ty členy, kteří přednášku nestihli. Adinu vykolejilo, že Discord při sdílení obrazovky nějak schoval všechno ostatní, takže nevěděla, jestli je vůbec připojená na call. Techniku jsme sice před přednáškou zkoušeli, ale na 1-1 callu, ne v místnosti, kde se to asi chová jinak. Příště budu vědět, přidal jsem si to do checklistu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Účast v čase přednášky nebyla dle mých očekávání (byť mě Adina i další v klubu ujišťovali, že to nijak špatná účast nebyla), tak jsem se zkoušel ptát, proč lidi na přednášku nepřišli. Nikdo jako důvod nezvolil „venku bylo hezky“, i když bylo. 7 lidem nevyhovovalo datum/čas, 4 se spoléhají na záznam, 7 vědělo o přednášce, nicméně ji neuhlídalo nebo nestihlo. 2 nezajímalo téma. Největší problém je zřejmě prostě vybrat datum a čas, které sednou všem. Nakonec jsme se dohodli, že zkusím aspoň víc používat mention @everyone na všechny členy klubu, aspoň v souvislosti s přednáškami, aby si všimli, že začala, když už jsou třeba zrovna online na Discordu. „Víc používat“ je asi nadnesené, nepoužil jsem to zatím ještě nikdy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Počet lidí neovlivním a nevím, kolik jich přijde, do poslední minuty. Z toho pak mám vždy stres. Přemýšlel jsem, jak jej umenšit. Jednak bych rád, aby chodilo víc lidí. Jednak jde i o očekávání. Když přijde málo lidí, vím, že se ostatní podívají na video, ale prostě to vypadá blbě před speakerem. Cítím se blbě, že si něco připravoval pro 10 nebo 15 lidí. Budu to do budoucna řešit tím, že speakera na tuto možnost připravím, aby o tom předem věděl. Tím se smaže můj blbý pocit, když tato varianta nastane. Zároveň se budu dál snažit, aby přišlo lidí co nejvíc. Budu taky počítat s variantou, že nepřijde skoro nikdo, a např. na nadcházející AMA si připravím i vlastní otázky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMA je nový formát, který zkoušíme. &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/events/"&gt;První AMA bude s recruiterem Jiřím Psotkou&lt;/a&gt; a těším se na ni. Zároveň samozřejmě trnu, aby byly otázky, protože bez nich se dělá AMA blbě. Nabádám lidi, aby se klidně ptali už předem v textové místnosti na to určené, ale zatím otázky nejsou. Takže to možná zase budou nervy a trochu překvapení :) Ale jak už to tak bývá, mám nervy nervy nervy, ale nakonec to dopadne dobře. Budu připraven na vše a uvidíme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celou středu jsem věnoval domlouvání Jirkovy AMA, přípravě plakátku, dolaďování popisu přednášky, propagaci přednášky na sociálních sítích. Blbé na &lt;a href="https://buffer.com/"&gt;Bufferu&lt;/a&gt; je, že tam nejde naplánovat zprávu na LinkedIn, kde jsou funkční mentions na lidi a firmy, takže vždy musím jít na LinkedIn dodatečně a příspěvky editovat a mentions přidávat. V některých případech to nejde ani u FB statusů, ale to jen někdy, většinou to jde. Předpokládám, že za to nemůže Buffer, ale nějaká blbá omezení LinkedIn API. Na radu investorky jsem zkusil jeden nový trik: &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/464597201515797/"&gt;FB event&lt;/a&gt;. Pokud to pomůže šířit info o akcích, tak to budu dělat i do budoucna (časem ideálně pomocí nějakého skriptu).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probudil jsem se a v mailu jsem měl 14 notifikací o Pull Requestech, které udělal &lt;a href="https://dependabot.com/"&gt;Dependabot&lt;/a&gt; na mých repozitářích. Žádá mě, abych upgradoval z původního Dependabotu na verzi, kterou udělali už pod křídly GitHubu, jenž je před časem koupil. Jenže tato nová verze neumí auto-merge, který používám na 12 z 14 uvedených projektů.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1387691480375046145"&gt;Tweetoval jsem&lt;/a&gt;, proč se mi to nelíbí, ale u toho jsem nakonec nezůstal a začal i &lt;a href="https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/1973#issuecomment-829083554"&gt;komentovat a reagovat přímo v issue&lt;/a&gt;, kde se to řeší. Vypadá to, že s jejich názorem nikdo nepohne, ale do srpna, kdy se stará verze vypne, je ještě čas. Jejich argumenty mi přijdou nekonzistentní a nerozumím tomu, jak odebrání této funkce vyřeší cokoliv z toho, co oni si myslí, že to vyřeší.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lidi mi poslali spoustu alternativních řešení, ale já nechci alternativní řešení. Já chci, aby auto-merge podporoval přímo Dependabot. Důvody si přečtěte ve výše odkázané diskuzi (nemyslím tím pouze můj příspěvek, ale i ty pod ním).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ocitl jsem se na meetupu &lt;a href="https://www.meetup.com/Czech-Community-of-Community-builders/"&gt;Czech Community of Community builders&lt;/a&gt;, který jsem si někde nějak náhodou vyhlídl a říkal jsem si, že tam asi patřím, když teď provozuju klub. Bylo to online. A bylo to super! Příjemný pokec a hned jsem získal i velmi dobré kontakty na lidi, které zajímá, co dělám. S jedním člověkem si doteď píšu na LinkedIn, s druhým jsme měli dnes call o možné spolupráci mezi jejich firmou a klubem. Přidal jsem se i do komunity kolem tohoto meetupu na Slack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Použil jsem díky meetupu taky poprvé &lt;a href="https://www.around.co/"&gt;Around&lt;/a&gt;. Auto-mute super, to bylo o dost lepší než kdekoliv jinde mi přišlo. Ještě by mě zajímalo jak by to fungovalo kdyby vedle mě sedel někdo na stejným meetingu. Jinak hodně dobré funkce jako poznámky ve stylu Google Dokumentu, které se pak účastníkům pošlou. Na prd je, je že to nefunguje ve Firefoxu, takže jsem musel zas něco instalovat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="robot-na-statistiky-v-klubu-a-pridelovani-roli"&gt;Robot na statistiky v klubu a přidělování rolí&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#robot-na-statistiky-v-klubu-a-pridelovani-roli" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dokončil jsem robota, který počítá statistiky příspěvků jednotlivých členů klubu. Nakonec nikam statistiky neposílá jako čísla, ale uděluje Discord role. Některé jsou jen nenápadné štítky, některé jsou důležité a viditelné a obarvují lidi nebo je oddělují v seznamu členů.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nakonec mám lidi, kteří mají nejvíc příspěvků (od začátku existence klubu a za posledních 30 dní), potom lidi s nejvíce pozitivně hlasovanými příspěvky (od začátku existence klubu a za posledních 30 dní), lidi, kteří jsou v klubu krátce (do 15 dní), lidi, kteří mají profilovku a příspěvek, kde se představili (takoví jakože „občani“, rozeznatelní). Plánuju i speciální roli pro speakery z akcí a pro sponzory klubu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="impulzivni-laska"&gt;Impulzivní láska&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#impulzivni-laska" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V pátek jsem si šel zaběhat a všude byly rozkvetlé stromy, jaro, lidi v parku. Taky pár čarodějnic. Vzpomněl jsem si na to, jak jsem byl v roce 2009 ve Finsku a prožil tam Vappu. Chtěl jsem přiběhnout domů, odeslat dubnový newsletter, napsat poznámky a mít hotovo. Už tak jsem byl ve skluzu. Jenže mě zalila impulzivní chuť experimentovat a láska a vůbec, takže jsem vymyslel, že udělám slevový kupón na dnešek a zítřek (30.4. a 1.5.), s 50 % slevou, což je teda dost. Slevový kupón jsem poprvé zkoušel na MDŽ a pár lidí to do klubu přivedlo, ale jak jsem se bál, aby jich nepřišlo moc, nerozšoupl jsem se zas tak moc v tom, co jsem nabízel. Teď zkouším, co udělá, když nabídnu větší slevu. Co od toho čekám? Hele vlastně vůbec nevím. Asi pár lidí v klubu a pár rychlých peněz navíc, ale spíš je to prostě impulzivní páteční sváteční experiment. Snad se počet lidí bude nějak regulovat tím, že je víkend, a nepřijde do klubu 500 nových lidí :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;První máj, lásky čas! &lt;a href="https://juniorguru.memberful.com/checkout?plan=59574&amp;amp;coupon=LASKA2021"&gt;Tady to je!&lt;/a&gt; Použijte při registraci do klubu kód &lt;strong&gt;LASKA2021&lt;/strong&gt; a dostanete &lt;strong&gt;roční členství v klubu jen za 599 Kč&lt;/strong&gt;. Pokud už členství máte, můžete kupón někomu z lásky darovat. Platí pouze 30.4. a 1.5. 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No a tohle než jsem připravil a nasdílel a trochu ještě promyslel, tak to trvalo, pak ten newsletter, že, takže teď je pátek čtvrt na jedenáct večer, já teprve píšu poznámky a investorka je velmi nespokojená. Čím víc lásky na prvního máje pro vás, tím míň u mě doma. Ajaj!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="newsletter"&gt;Newsletter&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#newsletter" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ke konci měsíce posílám newsletter. Chci časem roli newsletteru umenšovat. Postupně ho asi stáhnu z webu, přestanu nabízet firmám jako způsob propagace nabídek, lidi budu přesměrovávat spíš na sociální sítě a do klubu. Nicméně zatím stále existuje.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zjistil jsem, proč byl ten poslední nějaký divný. Já jej totiž v Mailchimpu nějak špatně okopíroval a posílal se jen na určitý segment odběratelů! Úplně omylem jsem to poslal jen 100 lidí místo skoro 400. A málem se mi to stalo znova, ale všiml jsem si toho počtu odběratelů, kterým to má jít a nějak mi to nedalo, začal jsem do toho šťourat, no a zjistil jsem, že březnový newsletter byl úplně špatně. Ach jo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tak tady je &lt;a href="https://us3.campaign-archive.com/?u=7d3f89ef9b2ed953ddf4ff5f6&amp;amp;id=4d3b35637d"&gt;březnový&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://us3.campaign-archive.com/?u=7d3f89ef9b2ed953ddf4ff5f6&amp;amp;id=c1a74c1d08"&gt;dubnový&lt;/a&gt;. Tím dubnovým jsem si vytvořil tak trochu šablonu, kterou už asi nebudu moc měnit. Dřív jsem dolů psal různé novinky, ale teď už se mi moc nechce a asi tam budu mít permanentně info o tom, že nabídky práce jsou teď v klubu lépe než v newsletteru a že novinky mají lidi sledovat na sítích.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aktualizoval jsem všechny screenshoty v náhledech na junior.guru. Doplnil jsem speciální kód, který místo screenshotu FB skupiny stáhne její cover obrázek, podobně jako se nedělají screenshoty YT videí, ale stahuje se náhledový obrázek videa. Založil jsem u toho &lt;a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/pageres/issues/411"&gt;tohle issue na Pageres&lt;/a&gt;. Schovávat na screenshotech různé cookie lišty a popupy, nebo obcházet různé ochrany proti scrapování, to je fakt past vedle pasti. Naštěstí Pageres zvládá hodně věcí a co nezvládne ani on, to prostě &lt;a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/take-screenshots-firefox?redirectslug=firefox-screenshots&amp;amp;redirectlocale=en-US"&gt;cvaknu z Firefoxu&lt;/a&gt; na jedno tlačítko a uložím do složky, ze které si to můj skript vezme a upraví na požadovaný formát a velikost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vysvětlil jsem kamarádovi jak fungují streamy a file-like objekty v Pythonu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přečetl jsem si &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/patrickwardle/status/1386732292224155648"&gt;tento tweet&lt;/a&gt; a ihned aktualizoval macOS. V souvislosti s tím mi přestaly fungovat Xcode věci a musel jsem je &lt;a href="https://medium.com/flawless-app-stories/gyp-no-xcode-or-clt-version-detected-macos-catalina-anansewaa-38b536389e8d"&gt;přeinstalovat&lt;/a&gt;. Udělal jsem i update věcí v Homebrew a při tom se mi aktualizoval Node na verzi 16. Protože jsem nepoužíval nvm, tak se mi vše rozbilo. Při hledání řešení jsem našel &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/67241196/325365"&gt;tuto SO otázku&lt;/a&gt;, která přesně popisovala můj problém, řešení tam nebylo. Tak jsem řešení &lt;a href="https://github.com/sass/node-sass/issues/3077"&gt;našel&lt;/a&gt; a napsal &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/67303155/325365"&gt;odpověď na SO&lt;/a&gt;, kde jsem popsal, co se stalo a že nemá autor otázky používat „systémový“ Node, ale vlastní přes &lt;a href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm"&gt;nvm&lt;/a&gt;. A potom jsem to tak šel udělat i u sebe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opravil jsem drobnou chybu v robotovi, který posílá nabídky práce přímo do klubu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opravil jsem chybu ve stahovači nabídek práce z LinkedIn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loga na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/club/"&gt;stránce klubu&lt;/a&gt; jsem rozdělil na firemní a komunitní.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do komunitních log jsem přidal yablka. Poslal mi logo v PSD, tak jsem poprvé použil &lt;a href="https://www.photopea.com/"&gt;Photopea&lt;/a&gt; a super.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vyměkli jsme a přestali trápit náš aku šroubovák. Objednali jsme seriózní elektrický mlýnek na kafe. Tento čin v nás vyvolal smíšené pocity, zda jsme se tím nestali příliš seriózními a dospělými lidmi. Mele ovšem skvěle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vítal jsem nové členy v klubu. Už je nás 143 členů za 3 měsíce provozu klubu. Na stránku klubu jsem napsal přesně takovouto větu. Předtím tam bylo 20 náhodných profilovek lidí z klubu a pak slova „a 123 dalších“, ale i mě samotnému se to strašně špatně vnímalo. Podle mě by nikoho nenapadlo to sčítat, vidí akorát číslo. Takže jsem tam nejdřív napsal přímo „143 členů“ a potom to ještě změnil na „143 členů za 3 měsíce provozu“, aby to číslo bylo v nějakém kontextu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 7 dní od 24.4. do 30.4. jsem naběhal 8 km, při procházkách nachodil 16 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 6 hodin a zdolal při tom 24 kilometrů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="co-planuji"&gt;Co plánuji&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#co-planuji" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tři věci, které bych chtěl zvládnout udělat příště:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Napsat si s firmou, která má zájem o členství v klubu, dořešit konečně partnerství s jednou vzdělávací agenturou.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Úspěšně uspořádat AMA s Jirkou.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pokračovat ve tvorbě věcí, které zvyšují hodnotu klubu pro jeho členy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonus: Včas vypnout kupón se slevou. Zajít si na úřad pro novou občanku.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-co-vy"&gt;A co vy?&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#a-co-vy" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud byste čistě náhodou měli dojem, že jste oproti mě za uplynulý týden vůbec nic nestihli, tak mám pro vás skvělou zprávu! V klidu se na ten dojem &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/neni-to-zavod/"&gt;můžete vykašlat&lt;/a&gt;. Není zač!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="co-me-zaujalo"&gt;Co mě zaujalo&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#co-me-zaujalo" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když si něco přečtu nebo poslechnu a líbí se mi to, &lt;a href="https://getpocket.com/@honzajavorek"&gt;sdílím to na Pocketu&lt;/a&gt;. Od posledních poznámek jsem sdílel toto:&lt;/p&gt;

Článek popisuje, jak Google Chrome kvůli tomu zrazuje své uživatele a jde na ruku čistě svému monopolnímu majiteli. Přitom bychom se všichni nejspíš bez sledování obešli - Facebook i Google by se uživili i obyčejnější reklamou.&lt;/li&gt;

V textu usvědčuje konkrétního autora Novinek z povrchního, systematického šíření zloby a nasranosti mezi lidmi. Zajímavý způsob - chytit konkrétního autora za ruku a prohlásit „co to tady čmáráš na ty zdi?! já tě vidím co tady děláš!“ Se zástupy trolů to udělat nejde, s redaktorem rádoby seriózního zpravodajství ano.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id="pokusy-s-videem"&gt;Pokusy s videem&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#pokusy-s-videem" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Největším dobrodružstvím tohoto týdne bylo pokusné nahrávání videí s &lt;a href="https://coreskill.tech/"&gt;Danem Srbem&lt;/a&gt;. Myšlenka je taková, že ne každému vyhovuje vnímat informace skrze text, tak jestli by nešlo určité kousky &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/candidate-handbook/"&gt;příručky&lt;/a&gt; nějak jednoduše a nízkonákladově namluvit a těmito videi pak příručku doplnit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V rámci příprav na natáčení jsem si vykopíroval celou příručku do Google Dokumentu a začal ji zvrchu dolů číst. Když jsem našel něco, co bych rád změnil, doplnil, rozšířil, opravil, tak jsem si udělal komentář. Celé jsem to nestihl dočíst, ale už teď tam mám spoustu poznatků. Kdy to zpracuju, to nevím, ale jsem rád, že jsem to takto vzal při jednom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V úterý jsme se spojili a zkusili něco nahrát. Byla to celkem sranda, tréma, hledali jsme v mém bytě pokoj s nejmenší ozvěnou, apod. Nemám žádné profi vybavení, takže to byl trochu boj. Každopádně něco jsme nahráli. Dan to ještě tentýž večer zpracoval a zkusil něco nastříhat. Už teď vidíme hromadu problémů a chyb, takže osud tohoto prvního pokusu není vůbec zatím jasný. Teď bych si to měl celé pustit (což není moc příjemné, koukat se na sebe a poslouchat se, ale zvykám si) a dělat si poznámky, co by šlo říct nebo udělat jinak. Pak uvidíme, co dál.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Až budeme mít nějaké aspoň trochu použitelné pokusy, asi to dáme nejdřív k okomentování lidem v klubu, než se to dostane do příručky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="trvaly-pobyt"&gt;Trvalý pobyt&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#trvaly-pobyt" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ověřoval jsem, že nejdůležitější instituce (ŽÚ, FÚ, ČSSZ, zdravotní pojišťovna) si všimly, že jsem změnil trvalý pobyt. Protože se mi nechtělo nikam chodit ani volat, napsal jsem všem e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dobrý den,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;jsem OSVČ a přestěhoval jsem se. Chtěl bych ověřit, zda {INSTITUCE} zaznamenala z centrálních registrů změnu mého trvalého pobytu z {STARÁ ULICE ČÍSLO} na {NOVÁ ULICE ČÍSLO}, oboje Praha 3-Žižkov, 13000, případně jestli tuto změnu musím ještě dodatečně nějak oznamovat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Děkuji,

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prakticky do druhého dne mi všichni napsali nebo zavolali zpět, všichni milí a vše bez problémů. Vždy se to v pořádku zpropagovalo z rejstříku obyvatel, takže asi to fakt funguje :D Příště už tomu možná budu věřit natolik, že už nebudu psát ani ty e-maily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zajímavější byla jedna americká firma, kam bylo možné pouze zavolat, ale nakonec jsem zkusil nějaké &lt;a href="https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soci%C3%A1ln%C3%AD_in%C5%BEen%C3%BDrstv%C3%AD_(bezpe%C4%8Dnost)"&gt;sociální inženýrství&lt;/a&gt; a vmanipuloval opět jedním pouhým e-mailem svého předchozího zaměstnavatele do toho, aby tam adresu změnil za mě :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chtěl jsem změnit adresu i u operátorů a bank, ale ti mě poslali k šípku, protože chtějí doklad a já novou OP ještě nemám. Kromě T-Mobile, tam to šlo online naklikat i bez dokladu. Na dotaz, proč můj druhý operátor vlastně potřebuje číslo OP, jsem dostal odpověď, kterou si vykládám jako „někdo tak navrhl náš systém a číslo OP v něm figuruje jako neopomenutelné IDčko“. Meh. Takže to potom někdy. Ne že by mi vlastně nebylo úplně fuk, jakou adresu u mě mají. Každá slušná banka jede už přes net a když chce poslat novou kartu, raději se ujistí, na jakou adresu to má poslat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adresu jsem změnil dále i na webu, ve Fakturoidu a ve Stripe, aby byla správná na dokladech vydávaných členům klubu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="google-analytics"&gt;Google Analytics&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#google-analytics" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Říkal jsem si, že teď v poslední době moc nesleduju GA, tak že bych si je měl pořádně projít a zkusit z nich něco vyčíst. Udělal jsem si pořádek v goals, abych sledoval jen „club engagement”, tedy když lidi kliknou na tlačítko, které vede k zakoupení členství. Věci jako přihlášení k newsletteru apod. jsem vypnul, to teď sledovat nepotřebuju.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zda si členství opravdu zakoupí, to neměřím. Memberful má podporu pro nějaké Ecommerce cosik, ale to nevím jak funguje. Zkusil jsem to zapnout, ale podle &lt;a href="https://memberful.com/help/how-to/google-analytics/#set-up-manual-integration"&gt;návodu&lt;/a&gt; to vypadá, že používám něco, co se jmenuje Google Tag Manager a ten když jsem otevřel, tak to vypadalo jako nějaké markeťácké peklo na sledování lidí, tak jsem to zase zavřel. Já ty konverze stejně nepotřebuju (zatím) měřit end-to-end, stačí mi vědět, že se někdo pokusil zakoupit členství. Proces samotného kupování v této fázi nijak neovlivním, konverzi ani Memberful, ani Discordu nezlepším. Důležité je pro mě teď hlavně zajistit, aby se co nejvíc lidí dovědělo o tom, že klub existuje, a byly jim jeho výhody vysvětleny tak, že budou mít chuť se pokusit do něj dostat. Na to Ecommerce měření nepotřebuju.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No takže si čtu GA, ale buď jsem moc lama, nebo tam prostě nic zajímavého není. Nejvíc lidí chodí napřímo. Pak z vyhledávání a z postů na sociálních sítích. Z toho vyvozuju, že posty má smysl dělat a že mám dál lapat hledače. Hodně lidí zřejmě JG už prostě zná. Vysledovat nějaký pohyb na stránkách, který by vedl ke konverzi, moc nejde. Vysvětluji si to tak, že lidi JG znají a chodí tam opakovaně, o klubu slyší opakovaně, ale trvá jim, než se rozhoupou a zkusí to. Takže když se rozhoupou, jdou už na jistotu (ti, kdo kliknou, mají jako landing page buď samotnou stránku klubu, nebo hlavní stránku). Není to spontánní rozhodnutí. V takovém případě mi nějaké flow uživatelů na stránce asi nepomůže. Můžu akorát koukat, jestli moc lidí neodpadá na cestě ke stránce s klubem, nebo jestli stránka s klubem lidi přesvědčí ke kliknutí. V obou případech je asi co zlepšovat, ale že bych v GA viděl nějaké zázračné indicie k tomu, co bych měl udělat, to se asi říct nedá.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No nic. Trochu mě to asi zklamalo. Možná bych se v tom měl víc vzdělat, ale druhá věc je, že mě to ani moc nebaví. Nechcu nahánět čísílka. Myslím, že vlastně tuším, co mám dělat: Zvyšovat hodnotu klubu pro jeho členy a umět tu hodnotu vysvětlit na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/club/"&gt;stránce o klubu&lt;/a&gt;. Pak dělat PR, aby se povědomí o JG šířilo skrz bubliny. Nevím, co by v GA muselo být, aby toto bylo jinak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zvysovani-hodnoty-klubu"&gt;Zvyšování hodnoty klubu&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#zvysovani-hodnoty-klubu" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;První věc, kterou jsem chtěl už dlouho zvýšit hodnotu klubu pro jeho členy, je robot na nabídky práce. Ty se stahují a třídí každý den a vypisují &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/"&gt;na webu&lt;/a&gt;. Chtěl jsem mít v klubu speciální místnost, kam by robot nové nabídky sypal hned jak je najde, a kde by o nich šlo rovnou třeba i diskutovat. Jedna místnost, kde si lidi sdílejí nabídky práce, které někde najdou, už tam je, ale pro robota jsem chtěl separátní, aby si ji případně lidi mohli snadno vypnout, kdyby v ní bylo moc rušno.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toto jsem nakonec vyrobil za pouhý jeden den, protože vše potřebné už jsem měl nebo uměl. Akorát jsem to v klubu oznámil a pak jsem jeden den počkal, jestli to opravdu funguje (nastavil jsem privátní kanál, kde testuju robota), než jsem to začal do kanálu sypat na ostro. Odezva mezi členy zatím fajn, uvidíme co dál.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do budoucna by šlo nabídkám přidělovat emoji reakce podle toho, jestli jsou vytřízené dobře nebo špatně. Tím by šlo učit machine learning, jenž se snaží pro JG vytvořit &lt;a href="https://milavotradovec.cz/"&gt;kamarád Míla&lt;/a&gt;. Napadlo mě, že by to takto mohlo být lepší, než to mít na webu a hodnotit to přes posílání eventů v Google Analytics, přes klikání náhodných kolemjdoucích. Přece jen lidi v klubu jsou trochu víc zainteresovaní. V této fázi ale zatím nejsme a má to taky nedostatek v tom, že potřebujeme i vytahovat dobré nabídky z vyhozených, což ale znamená mít někde ohodnotitelné i to, co se vyhodilo. Kdo bude ale procházet a hodnotit stovky těch vyhozených, to nevím. Uvidíme. Možná pro masochistické zájemce. Nebo pro mě, že bych to občas prostě prošel. Zatím mám v klubu jen ty, které prošly. Lidi můžou hlasovat, zda se jim nabídka líbí nebo ne a toto se mi uloží do databáze. Toť vše.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jako další věc chci udělat bota, který bude v klubu dělat nějakou statistiku zpráv a jednou za týden ji postne třeba do #meta kanálu, to je jedno. Cílem je zvyšovat zapojení lidí, ocenit trochu lidi co v klubu pomáhají nejvíc a mít něco trochu jako „weekly digest“ pro lidi, co vše nestíhají číst. Jak na to? Projdu zprávy za poslední týden nebo měsíc (a třeba i od počátku klubu, jakože „all time“) a hodím pár čísel jako kdo napsal nejvíc (spíš pro pobavení, není cíl) a kdo měl nejkladněji reagovaný příspěvek (vyhodnotím reactions „inteligentně“), tzn. nejužitečnější příspěvek. Tyto nejvíc užitečné příspěvky pak i vypíšu, aby se k nim případně lidi mohli vrátit (to je ten „weekly digest“ trochu). Hlavně mi jde o nějaký kredit pro ty, kdo jsou užiteční. Můžu jim i přidělit nějakou Discord roli, ať jdou vidět, to se dá pak ladit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co jsem udělal první, je postování pár čísel do privátního kanálu. Budu se na to pár týdnů dívat a přemýšlet nad tím, jaké emoce to ve mě vyvolává nebo jak by se měly formulovat texty kolem toho. Jaký popsek by byl lepší, nebo jaká čísla tam asi radši vůbec nedávat. Toto mám rozpracované, ale nejprimitivnější verze s pár čísly už něco posílá.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protože jsem přidal už třetí skript (&lt;a href="https://andrewbrookins.com/technology/the-rule-of-three/"&gt;pravidlo tří&lt;/a&gt; přebíjí &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself"&gt;DRY&lt;/a&gt;), který něco dělá s Discordem, přestal jsem rozkopírovávat podpůrný kód a začal jej zobecňovat do nějakých abstrakcí. Vytvořil jsem si soubor s funkcemi společnými pro více skriptů a otestoval jsem si je. S tím jsem si hrál půlku čtvrtka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Přidával jsem na JG nově zaslané pracovní nabídky. Jednu, zaslanou v režimu „zdarma“, jsem musel odmítnout. Napsal jsem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dobrý den,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;díky za zaslanou nabídku práce. Pročetl jsem ji a požadujete v ní 2/3+ roky profesionálních zkušeností nebo třeba perfektní znalosti s HTML, CSS &amp;amp; SASS/SCSS. To bohužel cílová skupina https://junior.guru/jobs/ nesplní, pracovní nabídky tam se zaměřují vyloženě a co nejvíce na entry level, kdy člověk může nastoupit se zcela minimální praxí.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud byste vzali i začátečníka, pojďme zkusit vaši nabídku nějak přeformulovat, ale jinak bych doporučil inzerovat např. na https://www.startupjobs.cz/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Díky,
Honza Javorek&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Odpověď jsem nedostal. I psaní takových mailů je součástí obsluhy nabídek práce na JG…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;„Na sociálních sítích nelze být státotvornej. Je to jen nekonečné psaní písmenek do prázdna, u kterého vystřelí pár emocí, ale které si ani já, ani čitatel nebudeme za 10 minut už pamatovat. Jen nám bude divné, že před chvílí byl oběd a teď už je půl druhé.“ napsal jsem do komentáře na Facebook, a potom jsem si ho zablokoval. Ale pak jsem zase potřeboval něco vyřídit, a šup, už tam sázím nějakou geopolitickou analýzu toho, proč se Rusům nedaří akce tajných služeb. Dneska hledám logo yablka jako SVG, najdu jeho Facebook, tam odkaz na &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO4ObcFTqfA"&gt;tohle&lt;/a&gt;. Zase čtvrt hodiny pryč. Ty vole! :D Ty sítě jsou strašná věc. Přilepí se to na mě a vybudí to ve mě pocit, že mám někam psát moudra o Rusku. A nejde se odlepit. Pomoc. Když otevřu Twitter nebo FB a vidím, co tam lidi řeší, tak je mi jich líto, protože vidím, jak se nachytali. A po 4 minutách tam něco píšu o tajných službách.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nejsem spokojen se &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/practice/#courses"&gt;sekcí o kurzech&lt;/a&gt;. Jedním z cílů JG je vyřešit začátečníkům rozhodovací paralýzu a ukázat jim jasnou cestu, kde a s čím začít. Tato sekce jde proti tomu, je to snaha o vyčerpávající výčet a různé vzdělávací agentury jsou tam abecedně na jedné hromadě. Tento týden jsem tam přidal všechny, o kterých vím, a kterým tam chyběl odkaz. Jaká je budoucnost té sekce zatím nevím, ale v současné chvíli si myslím, že takový seznam nikomu moc nepomáhá. Bylo by podle mě lepší vysvětlit co je bootcamp, online kurz, prezenční kurz, jaké jsou v ČR/SR možnosti. Dodat lidem informace, které jim pomohou zjistit kontext a informovaně si sami z nějakého nezaujatého „katalogu“ vybrat to, co jim bude nejvíc vyhovovat - jinak se budou rozhodovat jen podle toho, kdo bude mít nejvytrvalejší PR.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/learn/#ladies"&gt;sekce pro ženy&lt;/a&gt; jsem přidal odkaz na &lt;a href="https://ajtyvit.sk/"&gt;Aj Ty v IT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během minulého týdne jsem byl na online meetupu v Namibii (viz předešlé poznámky) a trochu mě to namotivovalo se zase ozvat lidem a trochu třeba s něčím pomoct. V podstatě víc jak rok jsem moc akční nebyl. Napsal jsem tedy Marianovi do Mozambiku, s kterým jsme něco vloni v únoru řešili, a Jessice do Namibie, které jsem nabídl, že bych s ní mohl přes WhatsApp udělat rozhovor tady na blog. Jessica souhlasila a nápad se jí líbil. Napadlo mě, že by to mohl být relativně jednoduchý způsob, jak jim vylepšit viditelnost, navíc s Muheuem &lt;a href="https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2021/04/05/pydev-of-the-week-ngazetungue-muheue/"&gt;rozhovor&lt;/a&gt; nebo přednáška sem tam je, ale s ní nic. Má to jen jeden problém, a to, že jsem nikdy v životě rozhovor nedělal. Budu si asi muset připravit nějaké vhodné otázky :D&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;O víkendu jsem vyzkoušel &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/musi-simple-music-streaming/id591560124"&gt;Musi&lt;/a&gt; appku, která by snad mohla fungovat jako alternativní klient na YouTube. Sice tam občas vyskočí nějaká vizuální reklama, ale reklamy ve videu tam nejsou a hudba hraje dál na pozadí, i když se člověk přepne na jinou appku. Vyzkoušel jsem si na tom i schopnost nainstalovat mobilní appku přímo do macOS (což na M1 jde) a měl jsem z toho takovou radost, že jsme si se ženou jeden večer dali YouTube párty :D Ale možná existují i normální aplikace přímo pro macOS pro tento účel a nemusí se používat Musi, které je designované pro mobil, alternativy jsem nehledal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spadl mi stahovač &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/jobs"&gt;nabídek práce na StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt; a řešil jsem celé jedno dopoledne opravu. Pak jsem si uvědomil, že všechny moje pokusy asi naráží na 24hodinovou cache a ať se snažím jak se snažím, nic z parametrů, které měním, nemá reálný dopad na průběh stahování. Takže jsem se pleskl do čela, udělal nějakou minimální úpravu, o které jsem si myslel, že by mohla pomoci, a nechal to být. Druhý den to prošlo a žádný problém nebyl. Ach jo. Dobré aspoň je, že se tím ověřila kontrola chyb, kterou jsem přidával nedávno. Bez ní bych o tomto problému vůbec nevěděl, teď aspoň vím, že umí vážné problémy detekovat. I když je otázka, zda bych si neušetřil jedno dopoledne, kdybych se konkrétně o tomto problému vůbec nedověděl :D&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přečetl jsem si o &lt;a href="https://paramdeo.com/blog/opting-your-website-out-of-googles-floc-network"&gt;FLoC&lt;/a&gt; a pak na web přidal odpovídající meta hlavičku. Ale pak jsem zjistil, že pokud to není HTTP hlavička, ale jen HTML hlavička, tak že ji vlastně nic zatím neumí respektovat a možná to ani nikdy fungovat nebude, takže jsem ji zase odebral :(&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přidal jsem „lapač na hledače“ (viz předchozí poznámky), kteří hledají &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/topics/greenfox/"&gt;Green Fox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V klubu jsem udělal orientační anketu o tom, kdo prošel jakými kurzy. 26 samostudium, 12 veřejná VŠ neIT obor, 10 veřejná VŠ IT obor, 10 Czechitas, 10 PyLadies, 7 Udemy, 5 Coursera, 3 Learn2Code, 2 Engeto, 2 ReactGirls, 2 edX, 1 VŠB rekvalifikační kurzy, 1 Django Girls, 1 DataCamp, 2 CoreSkill, 0 Green Fox Academy, 0 Coding Bootcamp Praha, 0 PrimaKurzy, 0 SDAcademy, 0 BeeIT.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jedné vzdělávací agentuře jsem poslal fakturu, s druhou stále ještě vyjednávám.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Měli jsme schůzi výboru &lt;a href="https://pyvec.org/"&gt;Pyvce&lt;/a&gt;. Pár věcí se nám dokonce povedlo uzavřít a dokončit. Začali jsme pomalu připravovat členskou schůzi 2021.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Díky jedné recruiterce na LinkedIn, která má v popisu „Early Talent Program Manager“ jsem zjistil, že existuje klíčové slovní spojení „early talent“, které v řeči recruiterů nejspíš označuje přesně to, co se jim snažím pomocí &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/"&gt;nabídek práce&lt;/a&gt; dodat. Zajímavé. Zatím nevím, co s tímto zjištěním udělat. Našel jsem 5 dalších lidí na LinkedIn, kteří toto spojení měli v profilu, a přidal jsem si je. Třeba je okouzlí mé LI statusy a sami mi napíšou e-mail, že mě chtějí sponzorovat, haha :D&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;S jednou vzdělávací agenturou začínám pomalu spolupracovat na speciálním materiálu pro juniory, který budeme dohromady tvořit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nahromadily se mi nějaké věci, které by se hodilo naházet na sociální sítě, tak jsem polovinu pátku (dneška) strávil tím, že jsem připravoval posty. Asi pět postů mi zabralo půl dne. Snažím se těmi posty moc nespamovat, takže se posílají dvakrát týdně. Kamarád, který si dřív stěžoval, že moc spamuju, tak mi napsal, že si teď ani nevšiml, že nějaké promo posty posílám, takže asi dobrý. Akorát mám teď ve frontě třeba deset postů a kalendář to zaplnilo do konce května, tak nevím, jestli to vlastně nezahustit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upravil jsem různé texty uvnitř Discordu tak, aby odkazovaly na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/membership/"&gt;stránku pro členy&lt;/a&gt;. Uvědomil jsem si, že zevnitř nikde prolinkovaná není.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 7 dní od 17.4. do 23.4. jsem ještě trochu kašlal, tak jsem kašlal i na pohyb :(&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="co-planuji"&gt;Co plánuji&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#co-planuji" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uspořádal jsem si Trello tudů tak, aby odráželo moje aktuální priority: Zvyšovat hodnotu klubu pro jeho členy a umět tu hodnotu vysvětlit na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/club/"&gt;stránce o klubu&lt;/a&gt;. Tři věci, které bych chtěl zvládnout udělat příště:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doprogramovat robota na statistiky v klubu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provést odloženou &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/events/"&gt;přednášku s Adinou&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Naplánovat další událost a začít automatizovat věci kolem přednášek (výrobu plakátku, výpis na webu, apod.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonus: Možná bych po skoro dvou letech mohl aktualizovat všechny screenshoty webů na JG? Některé mi přijdou už trochu prošlé :/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-co-vy"&gt;A co vy?&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#a-co-vy" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud byste čistě náhodou měli dojem, že jste oproti mě za uplynulý týden vůbec nic nestihli, tak mám pro vás skvělou zprávu! V klidu se na ten dojem &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/neni-to-zavod/"&gt;můžete vykašlat&lt;/a&gt;. Není zač!&lt;/p&gt;

Sdílet náhodné youtubery hrozí tím, že to má stejnou váhu jako videa o placaté zeměkouli, ale přišlo mi, že to celkem dává smysl. Jde hlavně vidět, jak je USA jinde ve vnímání MHD a aut, a že na tom jsme v ČR vlastně ještě skvěle, ani si to neuvědomujeme :) Japonsko a Evropa staví vlaky, zatímco USA sní o hyperloopech, jen aby se lidi nemuseli nedejbože ani přiblížit k něčemu jako veřejně financovanému vlaku.&lt;/li&gt;

Sdílím ho „k zamyšlení“, ale osobně nesouhlasím nebo přinejmenším zatím nesouhlasím hned s několika věcmi. Vliv OSS na hiring mi přijde přeceněný, ale třeba je to v USA jiné. Vliv na sociální kredit je jistě značný. Že jsem morálně zodpovědný za to, že někdo vezme SW a použije ke „zlu“ (Co je zlo? Spousta zla lze snadno definovat, ale ještě větší spousta bude subjektivní?), to mi přijde jako blbost. Jako by vynálezce motoru byl zodpovědný za to, že díky ním létaly Messerschmitty? Nebo vyrobím kuchyňský nůž a jsem najednou komplicem všech domácích vražd? Pokud dělám nějaký projekt pro radost, nevadí mi, že jej dělám zdarma. Když půjdu uklidit potok od odpadků, taky mě nikdo nezaplatí. Je to Tragedy of Commons? Nedá se to řešit byznys modelem? Pokud mě baví uklízet strouhy, můžu si založit úklidovou firmu. Pokud mě baví dělat OSS, můžu kolem toho vymyslet byznys model. Pokud mi vadí, že můj OSS používají velké firmy, mohu mu dát jinou licenci. Jednotlivcům to bude jedno, velkou firmu to odradí. A možná stačí velkou firmu odradit prostě i jen tím, že to bude GPL, což je pro spoustu případů použití kryptonit. No, nechám to ještě uležet.&lt;/li&gt;

Velká říše zamezuje pokroku. Pokrok vzniká díky konkurenci a fragmentaci. Rozpad Římské říše a následná extrémní fragmentace Evropy během středověku byly základem pro naši dnešní prosperitu. Nebo ne? Jak to je dnes? USA (fragementovanější) nebo Čína (centralizovanější) zvládají prosperitu i jako velké „říše“, zatímco EU působí ve své fragmentovanosti málo akčně. Třeba je to ale jen krátkodobý pohled?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id="vyjednavani"&gt;Vyjednávání&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#vyjednavani" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S jednou vzdělávací agenturou je dohoda v procesu, s druhou už jsme se dohodli. Vyjednávání to ale bylo trochu nepovedené, protože jsem zapomněl v předchozí komunikaci dost jasně zmínit, že to co si domlouváme, chápu jako něco, co je součástí jejich placeného členství v klubu. Oni brali věc už za hotovou a já přišel s tím, že bych ale rád nějak dořešil tu platbu za členství. Pak bylo něco jako trapné ticho (to si jen představuju, psali jsme si maily) a následné vysvětlování z mé strany. Než jsme si zavolali znovu a vše si ujasnili, tak jsem z toho teda ani nespal. Vše dobře dopadlo, objasnili jsme si vše a domluvili jsme se v přátelské rovině, ale samozřejmě si připadám jako úplný blbec a představuju si, že oni teď budou u každé mé zprávy pochybovat, jestli jsme 100% na stejné vlně. Snad to časem zažehlíme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To jen abyste, milí čtenáři, věděli, že když člověk neumí sales, tak nejenže nic neprodá, ale dno to nemá na nule, dno je v mínusu. Neschopnost prodávat může být tak „skvělá“, že může dokonce vztahy poškodit. Naštěstí to celé mělo happy end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lapace-hledajicich"&gt;Lapače hledajících&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#lapace-hledajicich" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Velkou část týdne jsem dokončoval Proof of Concept stránek generovaných přes MkDocs a vyráběl „lapače na hledající“. Možná se tomu říká &lt;em&gt;landing pages&lt;/em&gt; nebo nějak jinak, nejsem SEO expert, vlastně hlavně doufám, že mě za to Google nevymaže z indexu. Při tvoření těchto stránek jsem si připadal jako nějaký podomní prodejce ve fialovém obleku, který vyhrne rukáv a tam má na předloktí 15 druhů rolexek v případě, že si nechcete sjednat pojištění ani vás nezajímá nová smlouva na plyn. Je ale dost možné, že takto si připadám jen já a je to úplně běžná praktika. Osobně to beru hlavně jako experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identifikoval jsem sadu nějakých zajímavých klíčových slov a skriptem zjistil, kolikrát je někdo zmínil v klubu na Discordu. Nejdřív jsem ukládal celé zprávy s tím, že třeba nějaké půjde přímo na stránkách ukázat, ale nakonec jsem to zavrhl, protože nelze nijak automaticky vybrat nějakou vhodnou, která by dávala smysl, správně navnadila, nebyla vytržená z kontextu, atd. Navíc jsem vlastně nechtěl, aby zprávy zevnitř klubu visely někde na webu. Co se napsalo v klubu, zůstane v klubu. Čísla jsem ale použil. Učil jsem se přitom s oněmi &lt;a href="https://github.com/fralau/mkdocs_macros_plugin"&gt;MkDocs Macros&lt;/a&gt; a celkově i s &lt;a href="https://www.mkdocs.org/"&gt;MkDocs&lt;/a&gt; a vymýšlel, jak to celé co nejlépe stavět, i do budoucna pro další stránky. Vyzkoušel jsem si makra a proměnné a tak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pak jsem tvořil jednotlivé stránky. Vymyslel jsem jich možná až příliš, při patnácté stránce mě to už moc nebavilo, ale dodělal jsem to tedy. Stránky lapají lidi hledající různé kurzy nebo technologie. V Google Analytics časem uvidím, na které lidi chodí a na které vůbec a jestli to vlastně vůbec někoho přesvědčí jít do klubu, nebo aspoň zůstat na JG a pročítat si tam moudra. Teď to nechám uležet a vsáknout se do vyhledávačů a uvidím.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Posloužilo to dobře jako něco, na čem jsem si mohl hned vyzkoušet MkDocs. Teď bych na MkDocs měl ideálně aspoň sem tam překlápět i existující stránky, abych časem mohl kompletně přejít na nový backend. Nevymyslel jsem lepší místo na odkazy na jednotlivé stránky, než patičku webu, takže je v ní teď trochu odkazový binec, ale to se dá časem vylepšit. Blbé je, že ty odkazy jsou v hlavní šabloně webu, a ta nejde sdílet mezi MkDocs a Flaskem, tu jsem musel rozkopírovat a pro každý backend trochu upravit. Výsledkem ale je, že tyhle odkazy tam teď píšu ručně a to ještě dvakrát do každé z těch hlavních šablon. Bylo to trochu ubíjející, nicméně asi zatím rychlejší, než kdybych se to snažil řešit programováním.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do budoucna jsem chtěl mít na webu stránky pro různé technologie nebo profese, takže teoreticky by se časem mohly vyvinout z těchto lapačů. Zatím jsou lapače jen s minimem textu a jedním tlačítkem, ale když se osvědčí, mohu na nich zapracovat, včlenit je lépe do webu, přidat k nim kvalitnější obsah. Například co je SQL a jak se ho naučit. Reklama na klub by pak mohla být jen doplňkem a ne hlavním sdělením takové stránky. Je to něco, na co se teď trochu upínám ve svých myšlenkách, abych si nepřipadal úplně jako ten podomní prodejce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="alergie-na-uklizeni"&gt;Alergie na uklízení&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#alergie-na-uklizeni" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Předávali jsme starý byt a při jeho uklízení a malování jsem se nadýchal velkého množství prachu. Z toho jsem měl záchvat kašle, který se nelepšil. Navazovalo to na už zhruba týden trvající nalomení zdraví, které jsem pociťoval, ale vždy se nějak ztratilo (takže jsem si šel klidně o víkendu zaběhat a v pohodě). Do toho stres z vyjednávání a z odevzdávání bytu. Následující noc jsem nemohl moc dýchat a kašlal jsem. Po probdělé noci jsem se diagnostikoval přes internet na bronchitidu, kterou ale umí způsobovat i covid-19, takže jsem šel hned na antigenní test a po telefonické konzultaci s doktorkou i na PCR. No, covid-19 nemám a to, co jsem měl, jsem následující dny vyležel. Ještě nejsem 100% ok, ale programovat se s tím dalo a domlouvat spolupráce taky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="videa"&gt;Videa&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#videa" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Budu natáčet krátká videa! Rozbíhám spolupráci na jedné straně se vzdělávací agenturou a na druhé straně s kamarádem. Videa by měla doplnit příručku a celkově rady na JG, protože ne každému se chce číst tuny textu. Uvidíme, jak to půjde, těším se, je to pro mě zase nějaké nové dobrodružství.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Z videí mám trému a tak si je sám přivozuji jen velmi nerad, ideální je, když mě někdo někam pozve. Před přednáškami mívám velkou trému, a to dokonce i před přednáškami v klubu, které má někdo jiný a ne já :D Teď se mi stalo, že se ozvaly hned dvě strany, které by udělaly videa se mnou, no a v týmu to už většinou nějak zvládám, na natáčení kývnu a připravím se. Kdyby ale bylo na mé převážně introvertní duši, tak raději napíšu 4 tuny textu :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na úřadě Prahy 3 jsem čekal 2 hodiny ve frontě na změnu trvalého pobytu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dal jsem lepší fotku k &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/motivation/#stories"&gt;příběhu Pavla z Olomouce&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přidal jsem se na &lt;a href="https://discord.com/invite/gbEyJEqwSD"&gt;Discord Elements of AI CZ&lt;/a&gt;, o kterém se psalo někde na CzechCrunch, &lt;del&gt;abych měl vlevo ve svém Discordu víc bublinek serverů a byl větší Discordový boss&lt;/del&gt; abych se podíval, jak mohou fungovat i jiné české Discordy o programování. Nic moc se tam neděje.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Samotné Outreachy &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/outreachy/status/1380226212832800769"&gt;retweetovalo můj tweet o rozhovoru s Lenkou Segura&lt;/a&gt;. Juchů. Mají 13.7K followers, ale nikdo mě díky tomu sledovat nezačal, protože to zajímavé, co dělám, je jen česky. Tak snad aspoň pár lidí díky tomu přišlo na ten CyberMagnolia blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poslal jsem daňové přiznání a přehledy pojišťovnám.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;O víkendu se mi Adina ozvala, že má zdravotní nesnáz, který ji diskvalifikuje z přednášení, takže jsem úterní přednášku v pondělí přesunul o dva týdny. Internet jsem s tím už nespamoval, jen interně klub, což mělo za následek, že pak přednášku v původním termínu promovala DigiKoalice na FB, ale zachytil jsem to a nechal opravit. Adina tedy bude v klubu 27.4., těste se těšte, její přednáška bude totiž nejspíš i částečně interaktivní.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domlouvám do klubu první AMA session s recruiterem. Myslel jsem, že bych to nějak nacpal do příštího týdne, aby se něco dělo než bude Adina, ale jak jsem řešil jiné věci a chorobu, tak jsem to nezvládl a nebude nic. Bude to někdy později. Domlouvám taky přednášku na téma „Život HTTP(s) požadavku“, která bude na témata jako text vs binární protokol, DNS, TLS, TCP, UDP, IP, OSI model, wifi, ethernet, prostě síťové základy, které se mohou hodit každému, kdo se sítí něco někdy dělá, ať už je to frontend, backend, testování…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prošel jsem a okomentoval kamarádův byznys plán pro jeho plánovanou mobilní aplikaci.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zjistil jsem, že když v jednom procesu spustím a ukončím asyncio event loop (viz článek tady na blogu &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/how-to-create-non-interactive-discord-bot"&gt;How to create a non-interactive Discord bot&lt;/a&gt;) a potom to chci udělat znova, jsem nahraný, protože loop je už ukončená. Jenže ve svých skriptech, které stahují data z Discordu, potřebuji přesně tohle udělat. Nakonec to vyřešilo použití &lt;code&gt;asyncio.new_event_loop()&lt;/code&gt;, viz &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/junior.guru/commit/d82b2a869f43b28bd1fd5ea48e8494f958e25080"&gt;commit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na JG jsem přijal novou nabídku práce, kterou někdo poslal. Tentokrát neplacenou, komunitní. Pokud byste to náhodou nevěděli, na JG &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/hire-juniors/"&gt;můžete přidávat nabídky práce i zadarmo&lt;/a&gt;, pokud jste třeba jen malá firmička, tým studentů, je to nějaká stážička, brigáda, máte nějakou spolupráci s PyLadies, apod.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Díky předchozím poznámkám se ozval známý s tím, že by si rád přečetl co připravuju s certifikátama, že by k tomu třeba taky měl nějaké moudro. Tak možná to nakonec nějak s lidma poskládám, i když o tom sám vím teď spíš prd :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Naučil jsem se slovní spojení &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/967870373283278/permalink/5287774447959494/?comment_id=5288090741261198"&gt;mat prsy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Připojil jsem se na Frontendisty o vzdělávání, ale nestihl jsem přednášku, která mě zajímala nejvíc :) Třeba si to ještě pustím &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VczYbGFfnI8&amp;amp;t=692s"&gt;ze záznamu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Udělal jsem review na Mílův Pull Request na JG, ve kterém přidává první ML magii (viz před-předchozí poznámky).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navštívil jsem online &lt;a href="https://pynamibia.herokuapp.com/meetup/"&gt;meetup&lt;/a&gt; v mé milované Namibii. Bylo super vidět po delší době známé z mé loňské návštěvy &lt;a href="https://na.pycon.org/"&gt;PyCon NA&lt;/a&gt; (letos bude online a CfP je ještě otevřené!). Třeba Daniele, který &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evildmp/status/1382021178592800768/retweets/with_comments"&gt;teď hledá nové angažmá&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2021/04/05/pydev-of-the-week-ngazetungue-muheue/"&gt;Muheue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JessicaUpani"&gt;Jessica&lt;/a&gt;, nebo &lt;a href="https://vuyisile.com/blog/"&gt;Vuy&lt;/a&gt;. Mimochodem, pokud máte nějaký peníz navíc, můžete s ním udělat kopu radosti &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/pythonnamibia"&gt;tady na tom Patreonu&lt;/a&gt;. Obnos, který v Karlíně vystačí na latéčko, naučí v Namibii dítě programovat. Lidi za touto sbírkou osobně znám a mohu se za ně zaručit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upravil jsem kontrolu toho, zda mi spadly scrapery pracovních nabídek. Předtím to nekontrolovalo chyby, které se nepovedlo zachytit :D Jenže když jsem je začal chytat, zase to bylo moc přísné. Ony totiž ty scrapery zalogují error i když se třeba nepovede scrapnout jednu nabídku, protože server vytimeoutoval. Což mě osobně moc netíží. Ale zase kdyby toho bylo hodně, asi by to byl příznak nějakého problému. Tudíž jsem dodal podmínku, že to spadne jen ve chvíli, kdy těch errorů je víc. Zatím jsem dal pocitovou hranici na 5 %, tedy pokud je počet errorů vůči počtu všech nabídek větší než 5 %. Nevím, jestli to vlastně není moc velkorysé, uvidím. Každopádně asi lepší než nic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 7 dní od 10.4. do 16.4. jsem naběhal 10 km, na túrách nachodil 8 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 5 hodin a zdolal při tom 18 kilometrů. Ve skutečnosti teda jen minulý víkend, přes týden jsem nedělal nic a pak jsem odpadl.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A nejzásadnější milník tohoto týdne: Do klubu se přidal Justin Bieber!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="Justin Bieber" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/justinbieber.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tři věci, které bych chtěl zvládnout udělat příště:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ověřit, že nejdůležitější instituce si všimly, že mám nové bydliště, případně jim ho nahlásit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finalizovat spolupráci s oběma vzdělávacími agenturami, přidat loga na web, apod.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Připravit a ideálně i začít překopání &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/hire-juniors/"&gt;ceníku pro firmy&lt;/a&gt; a poté stránky s &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/club/"&gt;klubem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonus: Přidat někam na JG kapitolku o tom, jestli jde programovat na mobilu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-co-vy"&gt;A co vy?&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#a-co-vy" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud byste čistě náhodou měli dojem, že jste oproti mě za uplynulý týden vůbec nic nestihli, tak mám pro vás skvělou zprávu! V klidu se na ten dojem &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/neni-to-zavod/"&gt;můžete vykašlat&lt;/a&gt;. Není zač!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O víkendu jsme se stěhovali a to poznamenalo tak nějak všechno, co jsem dělal nebo nedělal potom. A rozhodně ještě není hotovo, spousta krabic stále čeká na rozbalení a backlog osobních úkolů se mi rozrostl o nejrůznější úpravy, opravy, uklízení a předávání starého bytu, změnu trvalého pobytu, atd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="telefonni-ustredna"&gt;Telefonní ústředna&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#telefonni-ustredna" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volali jsme si s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1379773713990701065"&gt;Adinou Foxovou&lt;/a&gt;. Domluvili jsme detaily kolem její úterní přednášky v klubu. Odhalila mi plány na super nejlepší projekt, který do budoucna připravuje a já se vůbec nemůžu dočkat, až to spustí.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volali jsme si s &lt;a href="https://www.czechcrunch.cz/2021/03/programovani-ji-okouzlilo-tereza-vankova-ted-v-reactgirls-pomaha-dalsim-zenam-v-it-a-sama-to-dotahla-az-do-avastu/"&gt;Terezou Vaňkovou&lt;/a&gt; a bavili se o tom, jak pracovat s dobrovolníky a komunitou, s čímž &lt;a href="https://speakerdeck.com/honzajavorek/12-lessons-learned-from-9-years-of-community-work"&gt;mám nějaké zkušenosti z Python komunity&lt;/a&gt;. Držím jí s &lt;a href="https://reactgirls.com/"&gt;ReactGirls&lt;/a&gt; palce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Měl jsem hovor s šéfkou místní pobočky vzdělávací agentury XYZ. Možná domluvíme nějakou spolupráci.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kývl jsem na dobrovolnou přednášku pro skupinku studentů z programu &lt;a href="https://podniknito.cz/"&gt;Podnikni to!&lt;/a&gt;, kde jsem mluvil o své cestě podnikáním (která začala v roce 2007 a moje angažmá v Apiary vlastně bylo pouze malou pauzou v kontextu mé kariéry, kdy jsem neměl aktivní ŽL). Protože to bylo na konci dne plného jiných callů, nějak jsem se nestihl připravit a přednášku jsem vytvořil během hodiny přesně před jejím začátkem. Jsou z toho &lt;a href="https://speakerdeck.com/honzajavorek/zalozeno-2007"&gt;slajdy&lt;/a&gt;, ale nevím, nakolik jsou zajímavé. Rozhodně to není nějak skvěle vypointované nebo graficky ohromující. Bylo to ale hodně upřímné a všichni se pak shodli na tom, že i užitečné a motivující a fajn :) Tak snad jo, snad to k něčemu bylo!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="spoluprace-se-vzdelavacimi-agenturami"&gt;Spolupráce se vzdělávacími agenturami&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#spoluprace-se-vzdelavacimi-agenturami" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jsem už v kontaktu se dvěma vzdělávacími agenturami (v těchto poznámkách zatím kódované jako ABC a XYZ), které chtějí navázat nějakou spolupráci s klubem. Chci, aby klub a celé JG zachovávaly nezávislý status, takže nehodlám žádné kurzy přímo doporučovat. Ani nemůžu, neprošel jsem jimi, nedokážu posoudit jejich kvalitu. Mohu lidem vysvětlit &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1806114342948040/permalink/3581897008703089/?comment_id=3582808101945313"&gt;rozdíl mezi kurzem a bootcampem&lt;/a&gt;, ale to je tak vše. Chci být průvodce, navigátor, advokát juniorů, prostředník, třeba i &lt;em&gt;influencer&lt;/em&gt;, až zjistím co to je. Takže musím své aktivity kolem agentur s kurzy vyvažovat a je to tenký led. Lidi by neměli mít záminku zpochybňovat mou nezávislost nebo mít pocit, že klub slouží některé z agentur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Způsob, jakým na to chci jít, je ten, že s agenturami mohu navázat partnerství ve věcech, kde to s nezávislostí nekoliduje. Jedna taková věc je, že mohou k nabídce pro své studenty přidat nabídku toho, že v rámci kurzovného student dostane i tři měsíce v mém klubu, aby si snadněji našel práci, udržel si motivaci, zapojil se do nějaké komunity, měl s kým konzultovat pohovory, atd. Takže jakmile někdo absolvuje kurz v XYZ, pokračuje u mě v klubu. Agentura může nabízet službu navíc a má méně práce s kariérním poradenstvím. Já dostanu tříměsíční členství proplaceno a ještě existuje naděje, že když se člověku bude v klubu líbit, začne si to pak platit sám a bude pokračovat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Další způsob, jak můžu spolupracovat, je přednášet „na půdě“ agentur, tvořit s nimi obsah jako články, rozhovory, videa, podcasty. Ale musí to být vyvážené, protože jakmile to začnu dělat příliš intenzivně pro jednu agenturu, další dají ruce pryč. Naopak si musím takových věcí domluvit na co nejvíc stran, aby bylo jasné, že k takové spolupráci má přístup kterákoliv z agentur. A musím si dávat pozor, aby bylo z obsahu jasné, že agenturu nedoporučuji, ale jen svými „moudry“ doplňuji jejich obsah o něco svého.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud si to tady čte někdo z organizace, kterou živí kurzy, a chcete být mezi prvními u vzniku impéria junior.guru, ozvěte se mi. Bude to stát nějaké peníze, ale podpoříte vznik veřejných materiálů pro juniory, které pak sami můžete používat a nemusíte se opakovat jako kolovrátek, až jim budete radit, jak si najít práci. Taky budete mít přístup do klubu, kde se o ně postaráme a k té první práci je v řádu měsíců dovedeme a namotivujeme, zatímco vy můžete v klidu dělat to, co umíte nejlíp - učit programování :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="postup-s-mkdocs"&gt;Postup s MkDocs&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#postup-s-mkdocs" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pár hodin času jsem si nakonec našel i na programování, a to konkrétně využití &lt;a href="https://github.com/fralau/mkdocs_macros_plugin"&gt;MkDocs Macros&lt;/a&gt; pluginu k tomu, abych mohl Jinja2 a obecně různé HTML komponenty použít i přímo v rámci Markdownu. (Ano, vím, že existuje &lt;a href="https://mdxjs.com/"&gt;MDX&lt;/a&gt;, ale to je pro děcka.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zajímavé zjištění bylo, že těmi &lt;a href="https://github.com/fralau/mkdocs_macros_plugin"&gt;MkDocs Macros&lt;/a&gt; mohu kompletně nahradit ty &lt;a href="https://github.com/aklajnert/mkdocs-simple-hooks"&gt;MkDocs Simple Hooks&lt;/a&gt;, kde jsem posílal Pull Request na opravu toho, jak se tam importují moduly :D Ale tak aspoň jsem udělal svět lepším a voňavějším. V rámci stejné strategie jsem pokračoval i tady. Opravoval jsem &lt;a href="https://github.com/fralau/mkdocs_macros_plugin/issues/71"&gt;rozbité odkazy&lt;/a&gt; a jiné drobnosti v dokumentaci pluginu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na čem jsem minule skončil bylo, že jsem potřeboval způsob, jak si Pythonem nastavit proměnnou a číst ji jak v Markdown obsahu stránky, tak v šabloně. Na to jsem založil &lt;a href="https://github.com/fralau/mkdocs_macros_plugin/issues/75"&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt;. Autor mi poradil, ale nefungovalo mi to, no nakonec jsem na to udělal celé &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/mkdocs-macros-playground"&gt;minimal sample repo&lt;/a&gt;, aby se mi do toho nemotala žádná komplexita z JG, a tam jsem vše odladil a odzkoušel a víceméně zdokumentoval v tom původním issue. No a hlavně jsem zjistil jak to dělat a jak to všechno vyřešit a postavit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takže pak jsem hned použil své první HTML v Makrdownu pomocí MkDocs Macros a díky tomu je nadpis na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/tos/"&gt;této strašlivé stránce&lt;/a&gt; o 1 % hezčí :D Ale důležité je něco jiného, a to fakt, že teď už můžu používat komponenty a HTML a Jinja2 v obsahu jinak Markdownových stránek, a toto mi zřejmě už umožňuje úplně vše, co na JG potřebuji. Další krok je, že pomocí tohoto způsobu zkusím vytvořit zcela nové stránky, landing pages pro určitá klíčová slova, které budou lidi posílat do klubu z vyhledávačů. To bude asi teprve pořádná zatěžkávací zkouška.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Po domluvě s Adinou jsem připravil upoutávku k přednášce a nasdílel ji na sociální sítě.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Velikonoční volno jsem plně využil ke stěhování a související činnosti, takže v úterý jsem otevřel mail a bylo tam asi 50 věcí k řešení. Úklidem inboxu jsem strávil podstatnou část začátku týdne. Taky jsem se pověnoval klubu a všem sociálním sítím.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Díky kamarádům jsem narazil na super týpka jménem &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;amp;v=3vBwRfQbXkg"&gt;Marc Rebillet&lt;/a&gt;, který dělá skvělou živou hudbu. V tom lepším případě bývá v županu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na &lt;a href="https://docs.pyvec.org"&gt;docs.pyvec.org&lt;/a&gt; se rozbily nějaké odkazy, tak jsem to debugoval a opravoval.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Narazil jsem na web &lt;a href="https://www.designui.cz/"&gt;Designui&lt;/a&gt; a pročítal si všechny články, které tam vyšly. Líbilo se mi to a všiml jsem si, že jsou tam i pracovní nabídky, tak jsem si autora přidal na LinkedIn a pokecali jsme o tom, jaké to je zkoušet tvořit něco jako projekt/produkt v jednom člověku. Hurá, konečně nějaká trochu spřízněná duše s podobným cílem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kamarád řešil jednu pracovní nabídku a následně i pohovor, tak jsme si volali a probírali to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 7 dní od 3.4. do 9.4. jsem se hýbal 0 hodin a zdolal při tom 0 kilometrů. Ehm. Vynášení krabic do schodů Strava nepočítá. No, nebudu se vymlouvat, proběhnout nebo projít jsem se jít mohl. Snad to trochu doženu přes víkend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Po emailech pokračujeme v domlouvání spolupráce s agenturou ABC, s níž už jsem si volal dřív. Některé věci jsme už i domluvili, některé jsou zatím v přípravě.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Po emailech pokračujeme v domlouvání spolupráce i s agenturou XYZ. Nadhodil jsem nabídku a odpovídal na doplňující dotazy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Napsal mi tatík od synka, který si rozjíždí a administruje svůj vlastní Minecraft server, zda by pro ně mělo smysl přidat se do klubu. Probral jsem to s bráchou, jakožto tátou od synka, který si rozjíždí a administruje svůj vlastní Minecraft server, a došel jsem k závěru, že jim doporučím to zkusit. Podle všeho ty problémy, na které teenager při takové činnosti narazí, nejsou moc specifické pro samotný Minecraft, ale týkají se serveru, Javy, programování. V klubu jsou dva týdny zdarma, tak proč to nezkusit. Akorát pokud to smysl dávat bude, bylo by fajn sehnat takových víc. Už jen proto, aby tam kluk nebyl mezi samými dospěláky. Neřešíte někdo podobnou věc? :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dostal jsem od &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stepanb"&gt;Štěpána Bechynského&lt;/a&gt; předpřipravenou kapitolu do příručky o různých SW certifikcích, což je super! Samozřejmě si to budu muset projít, zkonzultovat, promyslet, zpracovat vlastními slovy. Nevím, kdy se k tomu dostanu, ale pokud o certifikacích něco víte, klidně se mi ozvěte, rád si v tom mezitím udělám pořádek aspoň v hlavě. Každopádně jsem rád, že mám zase o téma víc, které se dá časem do příručky zpracovat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poprosil jsem kamarádku původně ze Slovenska, jestli by neprošla citáty od yablka, které mám na JG, a neopravila mi chyby v přepisu. Korekturu mi udělala a na webu už mám vše opravené.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Při tom, jak jsme minule s kamarádem Mílou vymýšleli to ML (viz minulé poznámky), jsem udělal narychlo úpravu v robotovi na stahování a třídění pracovních nabídek, aby se snadněji pracovalo s těmi daty. Bohužel jsem při tom vytvořil chybu, která zabraňovala tomu, aby se vyřazené nabídky logovaly. Navenek robot fungoval, takže pohoda, ale pod kapotou to bublalo a syčelo a tekl olej na zem. Stěhoval jsem se a tak trvalo týden, než jsem to opravil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prošel jsem Mílův Pull Request s prvními záblesky vyhodnocování nabídek práce pomocí ML.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://junior.guru/motivation/#stories"&gt;Přidal jsem na web&lt;/a&gt; motivační blog Pavla, který odešel z bankovnictví, rekvalifikoval se a po intenzivním studiu si našel práci jako programátor. A to ne v Praze nebo Brně, ale v Olomouci. Ještě vyměníme fotku za lepší, ale na jeho blog &lt;a href="https://itnoob.cz/"&gt;itnoob.cz&lt;/a&gt; už se návštěvníci JG prokliknou.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/czechitas/da-data-jakpsatsql/issues/38"&gt;Ptal jsem se&lt;/a&gt;, jestli lze české Open Source materiály na SQL, které jsem našel, použít pro samouky. Vypadá to, že zatím (?) ne.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přidal jsem do ohlasů na příručku jeden citát z Instagramu: „S programováním sice nemám zkušenosti, ale od března jsem se začala učit CSS/HTML a tvořit weby. Příručku, díky přihlášení do newsletteru, jsem mohla přečist už před začátkem září. A sfoukla jsem ji celou na jeden zátah. Je to velice praktický a univerzální návod, ve kterém inspirace a rady najde nejen budoucí programátor. Díky za Tvou práci! :)“&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přidal jsem do ohlasů na klub jeden citát od kamaráda Jakuba: „Ty diskuse jsou úžasné. Když to lidi zaplatí, tak je to úplně jiné. Extrémně kultivované, srozumitelné, každý příspěvek dává smysl.“&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zdá se, že nový copywriting na úvodní stránce JG funguje, někomu to přišlo natolik chytlavé, že to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jandolezal/status/1380042831549583362"&gt;cituje ve tweetu&lt;/a&gt; :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tři věci, které bych chtěl zvládnout udělat příště:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Řešit následky stěhování, nedá se nic dělat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dokončit PoC landing pages na klub.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poslat konečně DPFO.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonus: Posunout se v domlouvání partnerství s agenturami.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-co-vy"&gt;A co vy?&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#a-co-vy" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud byste čistě náhodou měli dojem, že jste oproti mě za uplynulý týden vůbec nic nestihli, tak mám pro vás skvělou zprávu! V klidu se na ten dojem &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/neni-to-zavod/"&gt;můžete vykašlat&lt;/a&gt;. Není zač!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="prednaska"&gt;Přednáška&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#prednaska" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hlavní událostí týdne byla &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/events/#2021-03-31T18-00-00"&gt;středeční přednáška Ládi Prskavce o Jamstacku&lt;/a&gt; pro členy klubu. V předchozích týdnech jsem vyřešil nahrávání přednášek na mém počítači a přišlo mi, že už od první přednášky nějaký čas uplynul, takže by bylo záhodno naplánovat další. Láďa mohl hned tuto středu, takže jsem to risknul a většinu pondělí věnoval oznámení a přípravě přednášky. Prošel jsem svůj todo list k přednášce a postupně vše odškrtával. V den přednášky jsem vyzkoušel nahrávání a s &lt;a href="https://coreskill.tech/"&gt;Danem Srbem&lt;/a&gt; jsme doladili ještě nějaké detaily, aby to lépe znělo, že mám mít spíš drátová sluchátka, a tak. Na přednášku nakonec dorazilo do 20 lidí, což může mít různé příčiny:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Velmi hezké počasí ten den a nastupující jaro,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;téma jsem pojmenoval Jamstack, což možná začátečníkům tolik neřeklo (možná lepší: „Jak si snadno vyrobit a nasadit staticky generovaný blog“),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lidé mohli předpokládat, že přednášku zase nahraju, takže o ni nepřijdou, když nepřijdou,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;oznámení proběhlo v pondělí, pouhé dva dny před samotnou událostí.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Každopádně kdo dorazil, tomu se přednáška líbila, zhusta to lidi psali do chatu a děkovali za přínosné informace a odkazy k nastudování. Video jsem nahrál na YouTube hned, mám tam šablonu na popisek, takže to trvalo jen chviličku, než bylo vše připraveno a mohl jsem záznam odkázat z klubu a pak i z webu. &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/events/"&gt;Stránku s akcemi&lt;/a&gt; na webu stále spravuji pouze jen přesouváním a editací HTML tagů.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mkdocs"&gt;MkDocs&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#mkdocs" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prozkoumával jsem dál možnost postupně předělat JG na MkDocs. Vymyslel jsem, jak vyřešit CSS na stránkách, které jsou vyrobené pomocí MkDocs. Prostě jsem doplnil pár pravidel do CSS a doplácl to tam tak, aby vypadaly stejně. Bylo to nejefektivnější a v současnosti nejekonomičtější. Musím změny dělat postupně a nemůžu přepisovat backend a frontend zároveň. Nejdřív backend, pak jednou třeba frontend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tím budiž stránka &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/privacy/"&gt;/privacy/&lt;/a&gt; první stránkou, kterou na JG generuje MkDocs. Další je &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/tos/"&gt;/tos/&lt;/a&gt;, kde ale navrchu není design správně. Aby byl správně, musím do MkDocs doplnit podporu pro nějaké komponenty nebo šablonování. A to jsem našel u pluginu &lt;a href="https://mkdocs-macros-plugin.readthedocs.io/"&gt;mkdocs-macros&lt;/a&gt;. Myslím si, že ten mi umožní vše, co budu potřebovat. Ve čtvrtek jsem si přečetl celou jeho dokumentaci a hned na GitHubu projektu založil několik issues a poslal několik Pull Requestů. Většina je oprava překlepů v dokumentaci a pak jeden &lt;a href="https://github.com/fralau/mkdocs_macros_plugin/issues/75"&gt;dotaz&lt;/a&gt;. Jednak projektu opravami pomůžu, jednak díky nim uvidím, jak autor reaguje a jestli na tom mám stavět celý svůj byznys. Dokumentace je taková trochu divoká, autor velmi rád používá různé boxíky na poznámky a upozornění, což ji v důsledku dost znepřehledňuje, ale hlavní je, že dokumentace existuje. Občas jsem pozvedl obočí nad určitými design decisions, ale nebudu dělat chytráka, zatím to vypadá, že toto řeší všechny moje problémy a raději přispěju do něčeho, co už existuje a kde nás na údržbu bude víc, než abych vynalézal vlastní kolo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="machine-learning"&gt;Machine Learning&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#machine-learning" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamarád &lt;a href="https://milavotradovec.cz/"&gt;Míla Votradovec&lt;/a&gt; se začal šťourat v ML a hledal data a projekt, na kterém by si to mohl vyzkoušet. Ptal se mě, jestli na JG něco nemám. No, mám. Mám robota na nabídky práce a je to dost ruční práce, je třídit. Jakože ne úplně ruční, ale je to hromada regulárů a je to hodně práce vyrobit, odladit, udržovat, opravovat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Míla si už v předchozích týdnech s pomocí mého vedení stáhl nějaká historická data a začal na nich trénovat modely. Já tomu moc nerozumím, ale vrátil se s tím, že to celkem funguje. Takže jsme si zavolali a vymysleli další postup. Idealistická, naivní vize, kterou jsme vytvořili, je následující:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na webu by byl výpis nabídek, které robotem prošly. Pak by tam byl bokem i výpis nabídek, které robot vyhodil. Já osobně, ale i návštěvníci webu, bychom mohli oba seznamy pročítat a pokud by něco bylo klasifikováno špatně, mohli bychom kliknout na nějaké tlačítko a dát zpětnou vazbu. To by šlo udělat i na statických stránkách, třeba přes Google Analytics event. Následně se model přetrénuje a bude se takto postupně učit. To by znamenalo, že klasifikace nabídek se bude vylepšovat čistě tím, že si někdy udělám čas a poklikám to, nebo i tím, že na to budou klikat lidi. To by bylo mnohonásobně méně náročné na údržbu než to, co mám teď.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Míla věří, že by možná šlo snadno natrénovat i Slovenštinu, ale to si já nemyslím. Na druhou stranu, přidat teď Slovenštinu znamená programovat prakticky celého robota znova pro další jazyk a dlouze to ladit a probírat se hromadou dat ručně a pak zase ladit, psát testy a ladit. Kdyby robot fungoval přes ML, tak by mi „stačilo“ stáhnout třeba 1000 nabídek z &lt;a href="https://www.profesia.sk/"&gt;Profesia.sk&lt;/a&gt;, jednou bych je prošel a ručně klasifikoval, ale následně by to už bylo hotové. Pak už by se to učilo „samo“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jsem zvědavý, co z toho nakonec bude. Každopádně takovéto věci se vám mohou stát asi jen tehdy, pokud je váš projekt Open Source. K dnešnímu dni jsem už dostal přes Pull Requesty několik oprav textu, a to jsem ani repozitář nijak pro přispěvatele nepřipravil. Toto je další krok k tomu, aby JG byl časem projekt, do kterého přispívají i další z komunity kolem něj.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="priorita"&gt;Priorita&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#priorita" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Řešil jsem, co je teď vlastně moje priorita. Rád bych pokračoval v MkDocs a třeba i předělával CSS na webu, ale tyto věci nemají žádnou hodnotu pro uživatele, pouze v hodně rozmlžené a dlouhodobé podobě. V době, kdy projekt ještě nevydělává dost na to, abych se mu mohl v budoucnu věnovat naplno, si toto nemohu dovolit. Co je tedy ta jedna hlavní věc, kterou bych teď měl dělat? Jakým jedním slovem ji mohu pojmenovat?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Po ranním pondělním zamyšlení jsem si ujasnil, že jsou to „zvyšování hodnoty klubu“ a „marketing“. Potřebuju prostě stále do klubu hlavně dostat víc lidí a firem. To mohu udělat tak, že se o něm doví, a vylepšit tím, že pro členy klubu bude více a více různých výhod a vychytávek. Napsal a nastudoval jsem si na zahraničních webech, co takového mohu dělat. Udělal jsem si z toho kartičky v Trellu a celý nový sloupec, z něhož bych teď měl sekat jednu věc za druhou.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No a chtělo by to ještě i nějaké ty marketingové nápady. Trochu mi dochází dech. Nevím tak úplně, jak bych se zase dostal na úvodní stránku Hospodářek nebo něco podobného :) Ale třeba mě něco napadne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mám nového podporovatele! &lt;a href="https://github.com/petrvacha"&gt;Petr Vácha&lt;/a&gt; mě teď podporuje &lt;a href="https://github.com/sponsors/honzajavorek/"&gt;přes GitHub Sponsors&lt;/a&gt;. Hned jsem jej přidal do &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/donate/#sponsors"&gt;seznamu podporovatelů&lt;/a&gt; a pozval do klubu. Pokud mě chcete podpořit podobně jako Petr, stačí, když si &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/club/"&gt;koupíte členství v klubu&lt;/a&gt;. Je ale fakt, že na GitHubu nebo Patreonu mě můžete podpořit vyšší částkou, než je členství v klubu, a konkrétně GitHub ji zatím stále zdvojnásobuje (měl to dělat jen rok a podle mě to už mělo teď nekdy končit, ale stále to zdvojnásobuje a já si nestěžuju). Tyto příspěvky stále tvoří významnou část mého měsíčního příjmu a jsem za ně rád. Každý podporovatel má automaticky přístup i do klubu, i když jsem odměny na GitHubu ani Patreonu s touto informací ještě neaktualizoval.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domlouvám už další přednášku. Zatím prozradím jen to, že to bude frontendistka a bude to super.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Napadlo mě, že bych mohl kromě přednášek dělat i AMA seance. Přemýšlel jsem, s kým by dávaly největší smysl a pak mi došlo, že s recruitery, tedy jak říká yablko, s dávači pohovorov. Jednoho jsem hned naťukl a odpověď byla, cituji, „thousand times yes“. Naťukl jsem to i v klubu a tam to má hromadu palců nahoru v reakcích, takže asi už stačí akorát najít termín a naučit se takové seance dělat, připravovat, moderovat :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poslal jsem &lt;a href="https://us3.campaign-archive.com/?u=7d3f89ef9b2ed953ddf4ff5f6&amp;amp;id=4d3b35637d"&gt;březnový newsletter s nabídkami práce&lt;/a&gt;. Zvládl jsem to už v úterý, jednak proto, že jsem věděl, že v den přednášky na to nebudu mít vůbec čas, jednak proto, že jsem tam chtěl přednášku promovat. Z MailChimpu zmizela možnost odeslat newsletter do 24 hodin znovu lidem, kteří jej ještě neotevřeli, což v minulosti zlepšovalo doručování. Netuším proč.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://coreskill.tech/"&gt;Daniel Srb&lt;/a&gt; si všiml, že když budu mít v CSS &lt;code&gt;.header__subnav { overflow-x: auto; }&lt;/code&gt; místo &lt;code&gt;scroll&lt;/code&gt;, tak zmizí některé scrollbary, které se občas na webu zbytečně zobrazovaly. Přemýšlím, jak dlouho tam byly, protože vím, že mi někdo posílal podobný bug report už někdy na začátku, co jsem to menu vyrobil, ale jak na macOS scrollbary vůbec nevidím, tak jsem na to zapmomněl.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V klubu jsem před názvy kategorií přidal emoji, aby se v levém panelu na Discordu dalo lépe orientovat. Myslím, že to ničemu nevadí a že to s orientací pomáhá. Opět &lt;a href="https://coreskill.tech/"&gt;Danův&lt;/a&gt; nápad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Všiml jsem si, že StackOverflow změnili trochu HTML u nabídek práce, takže mi je scraper tahá bez data uveřejnění a robot je všechny hází do koše. Vytvořil jsem test na nové HTML a opravil jsem to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Šel jsem na poštu a aktivoval jsem si konečně HW klíč z &lt;a href="https://overeno.mojeid.cz/"&gt;MojeID&lt;/a&gt;, díky kterému jsem se pak mohl online sečíst ve sčítání lidu. Nad otázkou, jaké je moje povolání, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1376978562419425280"&gt;jsem se celkem zapotil&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zrušil jsem webovku na javorek.net, kde byl náhrobek pradávné společné agenturní činnosti mě a &lt;a href="https://michalwiglasz.cz/"&gt;Michala Wiglasze&lt;/a&gt;, kterou jsme provozovali 2007 až 2012. Zrušil jsem i maily, takže na @javorek.net už nic nedojde. Stejně tam chodil už akorát spam, oba máme už sto let jiné maily. &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/javorek.net/"&gt;Repo&lt;/a&gt; jsem archivoval taky. Když jsem na něj teď při psaní poznámek šel, abych si okopíroval z adresního řádku odkaz, všiml jsem si &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/javorek.net/blob/gh-pages/nostalgia.png"&gt;souboru nostalgia.png&lt;/a&gt;, klikl na něj a docela jsem se zasmál.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;O víkendu jsem měl trochu času, tak jsem udělal nějaké Pull Requesty na &lt;a href="https://docs.pyvec.org/"&gt;dokumentaci Pyvce&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na regionálních stránkách s nabídkami práce na JG často nic není, protože prostě juniorní nabídky v Budějcích nebo Hradci aby člověk pohledal. Už dřív jsem tam měl větu „zkus omrknout ostatní nabídky, nejvíce jich bývá v technologických centrech, jako jsou Praha, Brno, nebo Ostrava“, ale teď mě napadlo, že kvůli (nebo díky?) covidu přibývá nabídek práce na dálku, takže jsem dodělal doplňování nabídek těmi na dálku, pokud žádné nejsou v místě. Viz třeba &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/region/jihlava/"&gt;Jihlava&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1377607653313159171"&gt;Uzavřeli jsme partnerství&lt;/a&gt; s &lt;a href="https://cybermagnolia.com/"&gt;CyberMagnolia&lt;/a&gt;, která sdružuje ženy v IT v Česku, aby je propojila bez ohledu na technologie a úroveň seniority. Zatím je z toho přednáška a logo na webu, ale určitě ještě něco vymyslíme. Chtěl bych mít na webu loga zvlášť pro komunitní partnery, ale zatím jsem dal logo do jedné lajny s firmama.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 6 dní od 27.3. do 1.4. jsem naběhal 9 km, při procházkách nachodil 2 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 2 hodin a zdolal při tom 11 kilometrů.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tři věci, které bych chtěl zvládnout udělat příště:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přestěhovat se během Velikonoc o pár ulic vedle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dokončit PoC landing pages na klub.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poslat DPFO.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pokud byste čistě náhodou měli dojem, že jste oproti mě za uplynulý týden vůbec nic nestihli, tak mám pro vás skvělou zprávu! V klidu se na ten dojem &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/neni-to-zavod/"&gt;můžete vykašlat&lt;/a&gt;. Není zač!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ač se snažím blokovat si sociální sítě, tento týden jsem se dost pohyboval na Twitteru. Začalo to tím, že mě někdo upozornil na diskuzi pod &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PaniZHR/status/1373922900294529025"&gt;statusem Paní z HR&lt;/a&gt;. Protože to bylo velice relevantní téma k tomu, co dělám, prošel jsem celou diskuzi pod tím a trochu tam zaúřadoval s odpověďmi. Snad jsem to moc nepřehnal. Každopádně mi přijde, že se díky tomu o JG dovědělo zase pár lidí mimo moji bublinu, což vždy potěší. Přijde mi totiž, že se mi moc nedaří prorazit bublinu a statusy na sociálních sítích už masíruji pouze přesvědčené fanoušky, popřípadě otravuji ty, které JG nezajímá. Sítě jsou ale můj hlavní marketingový kanál, takže je v mém zájmu, aby zasahovali lidi víc a víc i mimo bublinu. Nechci zase nějak spamovat, doufám, že v diskuzi u @PaniZHR jsem psal přínosné věci.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Další smršť přišla potom, co se mi ve čtvrtek večer stala neuvěřitelná příhoda s kurýrem Dáme jídlo. Během dne jsem poslal fakturu &lt;a href="https://inuits.eu/"&gt;další firmě&lt;/a&gt;, která se rozhodla stát se členem &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/club/"&gt;klubu JG&lt;/a&gt;, takže jsme si s manželkou řekli, že se večer rozšoupnem a večeři si necháme dovézt :D Naštvalo mě ale, že jsem si nemohl objednat z restaurace, do které jsem při hezkém počasí schopen dojít i pěšky, takže jsem Dáme jídlo na Twitteru &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1375149272245661702"&gt;trochu vyhejtil&lt;/a&gt;. Objednali jsme jinde, přijel kurýr, přebírám jídlo. A on pak říká: „Nemáte náhodou takový ten web, guru… junior? Já se teď učím Swift, no vy tam doporučujete ten Python, tak se na něj možná taky podívám… Uvažuju o tom vašem klubu, co jste spustil, ale ještě tam nejsem…“ No stál jsem tam před ním v teplákách a zíral jsem a jen jsem opakoval nějaké hloupé věty jako že to je fakt náhoda a byl jsem úplně vedle :D Nenapadlo mě vůbec nic rozumného. Vzít si na něj kontakt. Popřát mu, ať se mu daří. Dát mu samolepku, když už ho tam mám fyzicky. Ne, prostě jsem tam jen stál jak trubka a čuměl na něj :D Takže pokud toto, drahý kurýre, čteš, omlouvám se, že jsem tam stál jak trubka, ale věz, že mi to udělalo hroznou radost. Pokud se mi ozveš, něco spolu vymyslíme, taková náhoda se nemůže nechat jen tak :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1375157706999410690"&gt;Tweetnul&lt;/a&gt; jsem o tom a k dnešnímu dni to má asi 250 lajků, což je snad nejvíc v mém životě, nevím :D Bublá mi to tam v notifikacích už druhý den, followují mě lidi, už jen čekám, kdy mi někdo napíše, že jsem si to celé vymyslel a jen doplní „a pak jsi zavřel dveře a &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/APotomCelaTramvajVstalaATleskala/"&gt;celá tramvaj ti zatleskala&lt;/a&gt;“. Každopádně mě potěšilo, že &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chovanecm/status/1375166841824411651"&gt;nejsem sám, kdo v takové chvíli jen zírá a neví&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To, že se něco takového stalo, je fakt haluz a samozřejmě mě těší, že to, o co se snažím, má až takto viditelné výsledky. Možná bych reálný dopad JG pociťoval víc, kdyby nebyla pandemie a já chodil na programátorské srazy a tam potkával lidi, kteří se díky JG dostali k programování, ale takto si je mohu jen představovat. Nemám vůbec tušení, kde všude se to používá. Jen náhodou se dovím o tom, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dzarka/status/1375329550838722562"&gt;že si o JG říkají třeba na VŠB&lt;/a&gt;. Nebo objednávám u právničky obchodní podmínky a ona mi řekne „Aha, to jste vy s tím junior.guru? O tom jsem už slyšela!“ :D Takové věci mi rozhodně dělají radost a dávají mi ohromnou motivaci pokračovat v tom, co dělám. Sice mě to zároveň děsí, protože jsem jen týpek v teplákách objednávající si pelmeně a ne celebrita, ale asi to prostě souvisí s tím, že JG spojuji se svým ksichtem. Jednak je to &lt;em&gt;one-man show&lt;/em&gt; a přiznat, že jsem za tím jen já, je určitý druh transparentnosti, jednak mám nějaké předchozí komunitní zásluhy a JG se díky nim mohlo svézt na mém existujícím osobním brandu. Akorát mám teď dojem, že JG už asi veškeré mé předchozí zásluhy trumflo, je slavné samo o sobě a naopak teď můj osobní brand živí. Tak či tak, dokud mě nebudou lidi zdravit u pisoáru v hospodě, asi to pro dobro projektu a své kariéry přežiju.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Že bude tweet tak úspěšný jsem netušil a osobně mi vrtá hlavou, proč to na lidi tak funguje. Mám z toho ale radost, objevila mě díky němu i spousta nových lidí a třeba se povědomí o JG ještě rozšíří.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="poc-s-mkdocs"&gt;PoC s MkDocs&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#poc-s-mkdocs" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rozhodl jsem se, že zkusím, zda by šlo postupně portovat JG z &lt;a href="https://github.com/Frozen-Flask/Frozen-Flask/"&gt;Frozen-Flask&lt;/a&gt; na &lt;a href="https://www.mkdocs.org/"&gt;MkDocs&lt;/a&gt;. Důvody jsou udržovatelnost, možnost aby přispívali i ostatní, atd. Frozen-Flask jsem vybral proto, že jsem jej znal z projektů pro Python komunitu. Tam jsme se k němu zase dostali tak, že jsme původně měli dynamické Flask appky a chtěli je předělat na statické weby. Do začátku to bylo v pohodě, zastával jsem hodně přístup, že udělám vše tím nejpřímějším možným způsobem, takže je doteď veškerý obsah JG prostě v HTML. Zjistil jsem, že mi dává maximální flexibilitu a i texty v něm jdou psát dostatečně rychle. Kdybych začal s Markdownem, každou chvíli bych řešil, že doprostřed textu potřebuji dát nějaký box s něčím a kdo ví co.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No ale teď už jsem ve fázi, kdy fáze prototypování je nejspíš za mnou a především po pivotu byznys modelu už si dovedu představit, jaké řešení by stačilo na všechny moje potřeby, před pivotem, po něm, i do budoucna. A věřím v této chvíli po prvotním průzkumu tomu, že kdyby JG bylo na MkDocs, zvládlo by to vše, co potřebuji a zároveň by to byl mnohem jednodušší a přehlednější projekt. Což o to, já se v něm vyznám, ale kdybych chtěl, aby do toho začali přispívat i jiní, to by už bylo horší.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenže jak to portovat? Jsem velkým zastáncem &lt;em&gt;continuous delivery&lt;/em&gt;, takže rozhodně ne tak, že si to začnu někde plácat bokem, tam to budu připravovat půl roku a pak udělám VELKÉ PŘEPNUTÍ z verze na Flasku na verzi na MkDocs. Jen si to představím a hned bych vyjmenoval 10 důvodů, proč je to špatně, proč bych to nikdy nedokončil, proč by se mi zpomalil veškerý vývoj… Ne ne. Musí to umět existovat zároveň! Takže jsem tento týden vynalézal způsob, jak MkDocs nastavit a zakomponovat do projektu tak, aby dokázalo generovat stránky, které přepíšou stránky vygenerované Flaskem. Potom jsem si dal za úkol jednu z méně významných stránek postupně překlopit do MkDocs. Vyřešil jsem postupně všechny problémy a výsledkem je &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/test/"&gt;tato stránka&lt;/a&gt;. Negeneruje ji Flask, ale MkDocs. Je v designu webu, je odkazy propojená se zbytkem. Akorát mi chybí CSS obsahu, to musím ještě vymyslet, jak udělám. Potom tuto stránku přejmenuju z &lt;code&gt;/test/&lt;/code&gt; na &lt;code&gt;/privacy/&lt;/code&gt; a tu původní odeberu z Flasku. Srovnání zdrojáku stránky, aby bylo jasnější, proč to dělám: &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/junior.guru/blob/2857db7c0f61c84374a3f29661b99208923efa08/juniorguru/web/templates/privacy.html"&gt;před&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/honzajavorek/junior.guru/2857db7c0f61c84374a3f29661b99208923efa08/juniorguru/mkdocs/docs/test.md"&gt;po&lt;/a&gt;. Důležité zdroje:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/custom-themes/"&gt;Custom themes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/#yaml-style-meta-data"&gt;YAML Style Meta-Data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jak se používá &lt;code&gt;|url&lt;/code&gt; filtr v Jinja2 je hezky vidět &lt;a href="https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs-basic-theme/blob/d70850298bf0dd80afa63ab93b8af2b8301c77cb/basic_theme/base.html"&gt;tady&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V rámci tohoto Proof of Concept jsem použil plugin do MkDocs &lt;a href="https://github.com/aklajnert/mkdocs-simple-hooks"&gt;mkdocs-simple-hooks&lt;/a&gt;, ale zjistil jsem, že je v něm nějaká chyba. &lt;a href="https://github.com/aklajnert/mkdocs-simple-hooks/issues/4"&gt;Reportoval jsem ji&lt;/a&gt; tedy a když autor souhlasil, že má výtka dává smysl a můžu poslat Pull Request, &lt;a href="https://github.com/aklajnert/mkdocs-simple-hooks/pull/5"&gt;poslal jsem opravu&lt;/a&gt;. Myslel jsem, že to bude oprava na dva řádky, ale nakonec jsem s tím celkem bojoval. Naučil jsem se při tom něco o Python importech. Zajímavostí budiž, že požadavek na 100 % coverage testů na projektu odhalil, že část kódu projektu se po mých změnách stane mrtvým kódem a může být smazán. Pochybuju, že bych si toho bez coverage všiml já nebo autor. Nejsem coverage fanatik, ale tohle bylo fajn! Autor se chce na PR podívat o víkendu, ale já ho netlačím, protože jsem si knihovnu nainstaloval z gitu ze svého repozitáře a takto ji mohu používat, dokud to nemergne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nova-uvodni-stranka-jg"&gt;„Nová“ úvodní stránka JG&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#nova-uvodni-stranka-jg" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Začátek týdne jsem celý strávil tím, že jsem navrhoval novou úvodní stránku a novou stránku pro klub. Popsal jsem a pokreslil u toho asi 20 papírů a ladil jsem to do posledního detailu. Bylo to nádherné, krásné, dokonalé.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenže vytvořit to by znamenalo udělat na JG podstatné změny. Hotové by to bylo minimálně až za několik týdnů. A to už jsem slevil z toho, že nejdřív celý web portuju na MkDocs a předělám celé CSS :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, jak asi tušíte, nerealizoval jsem to. Když jsem byl na svém dlouhém běhu, došlo mi, že to nejpodstatnější, co chci dokázat, je dostat víc lidí do klubu, který na úvodní stránce nebyl skoro vůbec přítomný, ač je to teď to hlavní, co mi generuje příjem. Začal jsem přemýšlet nad tím, jestli nejde existující úvodní stránku zprasit tak, aby prostě jen lépe řešila ten konkrétní problém, a úplně novou že bych udělal později.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když jsem si to v hlavě rozložil, zjistil jsem, že by to bylo jednoduché. Hlavičku stačí nahradit tím menu, které je na všech ostatních stránkách. Na žluté části stačí přepsat text na něco, co vede na klub. Texty jsem měl už vymyšlené a vyladěné pro novou homepage, akorát bych je napsal do té existující a přejmenoval tlačítko. Sekce o nabídkách práce? Ty mi teď nevydělávají skoro nic. Když tam měsíc ta sekce nebude, stane se něco? Ne. Šup s ní zatím pryč. Sekce s odkazem na newsletter. Vydělává něco? Ne. Šup s ní zatím pryč. Pak stačilo sekci s kuřatama přebarvit z bílé na černou, trochu doladit texty a odkazy na příručku a bylo to. Jsem zvědav, jestli teď fakt víc lidí objeví klub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jsem s novou homepage spokojen? Ani za nic. Nejradši bych to celé spláchl do záchodu a udělal tu novou, voňavou. Řeší ten problém, který měla ta předchozí? Je v tomto směru lepší? Je, mnohem. Byla hotová za dvě hodiny práce? Byla. A je to CSS kód, který jsem psal ještě předtím, než jsem začal dělat věci v &lt;a href="https://www.vzhurudolu.cz/prirucka/bem"&gt;BEM&lt;/a&gt;, takže babrat se v tom byla fakt prasárna. Ale i tak to bylo rychle. Úkol splněn. Předělávání úvodní stránky se odkládá, tohle teď bude stačit. A trvalo jen pár týdnů, než jsem přišel na to, jak to udělat za dvě hodiny :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nahravani-zvuku-na-macos"&gt;Nahrávání zvuku na macOS&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#nahravani-zvuku-na-macos" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kvůli nahrávání klubových přednášek jsem řešil problém, kdy přes &lt;a href="https://obsproject.com/"&gt;OBS&lt;/a&gt; nelze ve výchozím stavu nahrávat audio z jiných aplikací:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OBS &lt;a href="https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/os-x-capture-audio-with-ishowu-audio-capture.505/"&gt;doporučuje iShowU Audio Capture&lt;/a&gt;, ale tento program už neexistuje.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V diskuzích někdo zmiňoval &lt;a href="https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/"&gt;Loopback&lt;/a&gt;. Ten je placený, ale lze zdarma vyzkoušet. Nainstaloval jsem jej, &lt;code&gt;brew install loopback --cask&lt;/code&gt;. Využívá kernel extension, takže jsem kvůli tomu musel asi desetkrát zadávat heslo, restartovat počítač a něco nastavovat v super security módu, aby to vůbec jelo. Ale jelo to, funguje. A pracuje se s tím krásně, vyladěné GUI! Ale 2700 Kč (a pak časem 1400 Kč za upgrade na novou verzi) je celkem pálka, když mě neživí podcasty apod., ale chci jen občas nahrát záznam obrazovky pro těch pět lidí, co v době přednášky neměli čas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Člen klubu mi doporučil Soundflower, což je open source. Má to &lt;a href="https://rogueamoeba.com/freebies/soundflower/"&gt;zajímavý příběh&lt;/a&gt;, lze to nainstalovat přes &lt;code&gt;brew install soundflower --cask&lt;/code&gt;, ale já to na M1 vůbec nenainstaluju. Na GitHubu projektu je i přímo napsáno, že to na Apple Silicon nefunguje, ale zřejmě to nefunguje ani obecně na novějších macOS a není to už vyvíjeno.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přes &lt;a href="https://alternativeto.net/software/loopback/?platform=mac"&gt;AlternativeTo&lt;/a&gt; jsem našel další podobné aplikace a našel jsem tak &lt;a href="https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole/"&gt;BlackHole&lt;/a&gt;. To je open source a funguje a je to boží!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takže můžu přes OBS nahrávat přednášky, hurá. To abych teď naplánoval nějakou další :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="landing-pages-poc"&gt;Landing pages PoC&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#landing-pages-poc" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Napadlo mě, že bych mohl vytvořit landing pages podle určitých klíčových slov, abych odchytal lidi z vyhledávačů na věci jako „recenze na PyLadies“ nebo „vyplatí se bootcamp“ a tak. Vytvořil bych stránky, které na tato spojení nějak cílí a tam by bylo napsáno, že přesně takové věci se řeší u nás v klubu a třeba i čísla („PyLadies někdo zmínil už 42krát“) nebo i nějaké anonymizované útržky, ukázky reálných diskuzí. Je to jen nápad a zatím jsem si jen zkusil vytvořit skript, který projde zprávy na Discordu a je schopen je vytřídit podle toho, jestli zmiňují nějaké klíčové slovo. Jestli to bude dál nějak použitelné, to uvidím. Snad to není nějaká black hat SEO technika, nevyznám se v tom :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Divili jste se, že DPFO nepodávám datovkou apod., ale chci jej doručovat poštou na papíře. Některé argumenty si můžete &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1374086330167259139"&gt;projít na mém Twitteru&lt;/a&gt;, ale pojďme tomu dát ještě šanci.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Řekněme, že papíry mám od daňaře vyplněné v PDF a už jsem jej nechtěl dále otravovat. Tedy nechci po něm žádat, aby to podal za mě, nebo aby mi generoval nějaká další XML. Jsem ale ochotný jít a ručně z papírů čísla přepsat do formulářů online. Začněme něčím jednoduchým, třeba VZP. Přihlásím se a tam toto:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="VZP web" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/vzp-web.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To je jistě perfektní, pokud o DPFO nic nevím a nemám už v ruce vyplněný přehled, ale pokud jej mám, tak tato políčka se nejmenují jako nic, co je na tom papíře.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="VZP PDF" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/vzp-pdf.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takže abych je vyplnil, musel bych pochopit, co přesně do nich patří, nemohu to jen 1:1 opsat. V praxi to znamená, že bych si daňaře platil zbytečně, protože kvůli neochotě chápat ten formulář a rozumět těm políčkům jsem si jej najal. Tak smůla, třeba za rok. Zkusím daně nebo sociálku. Je rok bankovní identity, třeba to půjde! Datovku nemám, takže mohu využít MojeID nebo banku. Jenže MojeID jsem stále ještě neaktivoval, jelikož to vyžadovalo jít na poštu. Pokud ale mám jít na poštu, to už tam rovnou mohu poslat ty papíry. Dobrá, zkusím banku. Jediná z mých bank, která umí tu novou identitu, je AirBank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="Airbank" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/airbank-id.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, takže taky nic. Nedostanu se ani na daňový portál, ani na ČSSZ. A toto je přesně ten důvod, proč při DPFO ty věci tisknu na papír a posílám poštou. Nenarážím při tom na žádné problémy. Nicméně celé toto cvičení má aspoň jeden pozitivní dopad, zjistil jsem, že mohu příště daňaře požádat, aby to všechno podal mým jménem. Tím pádem bych mohl příště delegovat i toto a nemusel o DPFO už napsat jediný tweet v životě.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Po tom, co jsem minulý týden zjistil, že existuje SPF, přidal jsem jej i na svou osobní doménu a doménu manželky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Měl jsem videohovor s &lt;a href="https://inuits.eu/"&gt;Inuits&lt;/a&gt;, kteří měli zájem stát se členy klubu. Dohodli jsme se a faktura už je na cestě :) Bylo fajn zjistit, že jedna z účastnic hovoru JG už delší dobu &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/juniorguru/"&gt;sleduje na LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; a fandí mi :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pozavíral jsem ty issues na GitHubu JG, které jsem kdysi vytvořil sám jako vlastní poznámky a nápady. Všechno kolem JG si třídím v Trellu, takže je zbytečné to mít ještě jinde. Issues nechám jen jako způsob, jak mi mohou lidé zaslat nápad nebo nahlásit chybu, pokud GitHub je zrovna ten způsob, který jim vyhovuje nejvíc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volal jsem si s jednou vzdělávací agenturou a brainstormovali jsme nad tím, jak můžeme spolupracovat bez toho, aby byla narušena nezávislost JG. Vymysleli jsme minimálně tři věci a už se těším, až něco z toho uvedeme do pohybu. Na mě ale bude podobné věci zkusit domluvit i s dalšími, právě proto, aby to bylo vyvážené a nikdo si nemyslel, že je JG „cinknuté“, že doporučuje hlavně kurzy toho a toho.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 7 dní od 20.3. do 26.3. jsem naběhal 28 km, při procházkách nachodil 5 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 5 hodin a zdolal při tom 33 kilometrů. Zaběhl jsem přitom svůj nejdelší běh v životě, přes 20 km. Tolik jsem naposledy uběhl v roce 2008. Nejsem fanouškem promazávání starých článků, které jsem vyplodil jako nezkušený mladý kluk, jsem archivář. Takže vzhledem k tomu, že blog existuje od roku 2007, jsou tady ty staré běhy pěkně zdokumentované: &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/pulmaraton-skoro/"&gt;Půlmaraton. Skoro!&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/dvakrat-mer-jednou-rez-vyjde-pulmaraton-na-treti-pokus/"&gt;Dvakrát měř, jednou řež. Vyjde půlmaraton na třetí pokus?&lt;/a&gt; Třetí pokus nikdy nenastal, odjel jsem na Erasmus, začaly mě bolet kolena, do formy jsem se už nikdy nevrátil. Až teď, juchů! Každopádně moje schopnost uběhnout 20 km nijak neovlivnila mou neschopnost bez velkého přesvědčování se ujít prvních 20 cm z předsíně ven před dveře :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="co-planuji"&gt;Co plánuji&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#co-planuji" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tři věci, které bych chtěl zvládnout udělat příště:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přestěhovat se o pár ulic vedle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Naplánovat další přednášku.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vymyslet co s CSS na MkDocs nebo dokončit PoC těch landing pages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonus: Najít toho kurýra?! Bonus číslo dva: Uprosit konečně kamaráda, aby prošel ty slovenské citace yablka, co jsem přidal na JG, a opravil mi v nich chyby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-co-vy"&gt;A co vy?&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#a-co-vy" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud byste čistě náhodou měli dojem, že jste oproti mě za uplynulý týden vůbec nic nestihli, tak mám pro vás skvělou zprávu! V klidu se na ten dojem &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/neni-to-zavod/"&gt;můžete vykašlat&lt;/a&gt;. Není zač!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="co-me-zaujalo"&gt;Co mě zaujalo&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#co-me-zaujalo" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id="prvni-prednaska-v-klubu"&gt;První přednáška v klubu&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#prvni-prednaska-v-klubu" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na úterý byla domluvena &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/events/"&gt;přednáška s Dariou Grudzien&lt;/a&gt;. Někteří členové klubu napsali, že se nemohou účastnit a jestli bude záznam. Záznamy jsem dělat nechtěl, ale říkal jsem si, že nějak bych to nahrát snad mohl, bez záruk. Zjistil jsem, že Discord sám od sebe to neumí, ale stačí, když se naučím &lt;a href="https://obsproject.com/"&gt;OBS&lt;/a&gt;. To je program, který jak jsem pochopil, znají úplně všichni kromě mě. No nic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V úterý jsem to začal testovat, ale zjistil jsem, že mi pár věcí nesedí. &lt;a href="http://encukou.cz/"&gt;Petr Viktorin&lt;/a&gt; mi dal krátkou konzultaci (video hovor přes Discord), při které jsme zjistili, že mi OBS nechytá zvuk z audia, ale jen z mikrofonu. Já dodatečně zjistil, že to tak na macOS je a aby šlo chytat audio, je potřeba to obejít instalací dalšího programu a nějakou složitou další konfigurací! Uf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://billykorando.com/2020/04/14/capturing-desktop-and-zoom-audio-in-obs-on-macos/"&gt;Capturing Desktop and Zoom Audio in OBS on macOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/os-x-capture-audio-with-ishowu-audio-capture.505/"&gt;Capture audio with iShowU Audio Capture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To byl celkem fail, ale Petr souhlasil, že přednášku nahraje, protože je ostřílený z nahrávání Pyv a kurzů PyLadies, takže to v pohodě zvládne, než si to do příště vyřeším u sebe. Já to tedy stále nemám vyřešené, akorát se snažím to iShow Audio Capture aspoň &lt;a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/issues/101349"&gt;dostat do Homebrew&lt;/a&gt;, nicméně jsem nikdy nic takového nedělal, takže kdo ví, jestli se mi to povede.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Přednáška samotná proběhla celkem v pohodě, Daria byla super a lidi z ní byli podle mě nadšení. Záznam v rámci možností máme. Je to obstojný záznam toho, co se dělo a těm pár lidem, co na přednášce být nemohli, to bude myslím takto stačit. Připravil jsem si úvod přednášky, ale nedomyslel jsem konec, takže jsem to pak ukončoval tak nějak neukončeně a divně, ale to se do příště vyladí. Také jsem Darii zapomněl říct, že si může v Discordu vypnout zvuky, které ji během přednášení celou dobu rušily. I v návaznosti na to jsem si následně vytvořil seznam úkolů, které musím vždy udělat. Zatím má 23 položek:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;najít speakera&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;oslovit speakera, nabídnout roční členství v klubu zdarma&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;poslat speakerovi &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/events/#speakers-info"&gt;základní informace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;domluvit téma&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;domluvit datum a čas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pozvat speakera do klubu přes odkaz na členství s kupónem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vysvětlit speakerovi základy Discordu, kde může zkoušet, připomenout ať si vypne zvuky u hovorů&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;přidat přednášku &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/events/"&gt;na stránky&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vytvořit plakátek v Keynote&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;plakátek hodit do klubovních #oznámení a na sociální sítě&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;v den přednášky připomenout v #oznámení, že to bude&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;v den přednášky vyzkoušet, zda mi funguje nahrávání přes OBS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;v den přednášky si připravit úvod před přednáškou, který budu říkat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;15min před přednáškou se připojit do klubovny a „rozehřívat“ místnost&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;zapnout nahrávání a další komunikaci vést přes Discord v mobilu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;po přednášce poděkovat a pořešit dotazy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vypnout nahrávání&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;poděkovat všem a ukončit přednášku s tím, že se odpojuji, ale kdo chce ať zůstane a povídá si, třeba se později přidám&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;zaznamenat odkazy, slajdy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nahrát video na YouTube jako „unlisted“&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do popisku dát informace o přednášce, odkazy, slajdy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;odkaz na video hodit do #oznámení, poslat speakerovi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;přidat &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/events/"&gt;na stránky&lt;/a&gt; odkaz na příspěvek v #oznámení jako odkaz na záznam, přesunout přednášku do archivu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Možná to vypadá děsivě a dost manuálně, ale některé věci se dají do budoucna zautomatizovat. Také se dá vytvořit pipeline speakerů, ze kterých potom jen beru a nemusím je vyloženě shánět. Také neslibuji přednášky na žádné pravidelné nebo časté bázi, zatím se budou konat prostě podle toho, kdy je zvládnu připravit. Uvidím, jak se to vyvine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Přednášku jsem propagoval na sociálních sítích. Proč?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;První dva týdny členství jsou zdarma, takže se lidé mohou registrovat i jen kvůli přednášce&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Je to karma pro speakera a tedy malé poděkování „slávou“.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vytvářím FOMO a dávám lidem podprahově navědomí, že v klubu se dějí cool věci. Kdybychom si tam jen povídali, pro členy to může mít nesmírnou hodnotu, ale nepůjde z ní nic vidět ven a tedy to nepřivede další členy. Mohu vytahovat citáty lidí a dávat je na web a sociální sítě, ale přednášky jsou rozhodně věc, která má užitek dovnitř a zároveň funguje i jako reklama ven.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Po přednášce jsem řešil co s videem. Petr mi záznam poslal přes &lt;a href="https://github.com/magic-wormhole/magic-wormhole"&gt;magic-wormhole&lt;/a&gt;. Kam s ním? Co s přístupem? Bude jen pro členy? Nakonec jsem zřídil &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp-dlEJLFPaNExzYX079gCA"&gt;YouTube účet&lt;/a&gt;, kam jsem video nahrál jako „unlisted“. Z klubu jsem jej odkázal v příspěvku na Discordu a &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/events/"&gt;na web&lt;/a&gt; jsem dal odkaz na tenhle příspěvek. Tím je zaručeno, že záznam je dohledatelný, ale nepřístupný pro ty, kdo nejsou členy klubu. Zároveň jsem sdělil, že politika sdílení videa je stejná jako u sdílení odemčených placených novinových článků kamarádům. Ať to lidé spíš nešíří úplně veřejně, ale ať to klidně pošlou kamarádům. Třeba to bude fungovat jako podpultová reklama na klub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="socialni-site"&gt;Sociální sítě&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#socialni-site" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zatímco v osobním životě se snažím mít sociální sítě stále zablokované, abych si čistil hlavu a nepropadal beznaději, zaměřil jsem se trochu víc na to, jak s nimi pracuje JG. Propojil jsem &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/26218444/"&gt;LinkedIn stránku JG&lt;/a&gt; s Bufferem a budu tam dávat stejný obsah jako dávám na svůj profil. Tu stránku sice sleduje jen pár zbloudilců, ale proč je zkusit neoslovit, není to moc práce navíc. Totéž Facebook, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/junior.guru/"&gt;stránka JG&lt;/a&gt; by měla časem sloužit k informacím o JG a skupina by měla ustupovat do pozadí. Zatím ale budu dávat příspěvky tam i tam. Zkusím se víc věnovat i &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/juniordotguru/"&gt;Instagramu&lt;/a&gt;, ale tvorba příspěvků pro něj mě nebaví asi ze všeho nejvíc. Stories vůbec nezmiňuju, na to jsem asi prostě už starý.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S Bufferem jsem dost bojoval, jeho UI mi přijde občas trochu nekonzistentní až psychedelické. Navíc je neintuitivní, že LinkedIn neumožňuje (zřejmě kvůli jejich API) udělat v Bufferu mention na člověka nebo firmu, ale FB page, Instagram, nebo Twitter ano. FB skupina ale zase ne. Ach jo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do budoucna bych měl na tyhle všechny profily dát odkazy i na JG samotné, aby je lidé mohli najít a mohli informace o JG lépe šířit, pokud na sociálních sítích žijí.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naplánoval jsem nebo jsem rovnou sdílel všelijaké další noviny, které se tento týden udály, třeba to, že se &lt;a href="https://lynt.cz/"&gt;Lynt&lt;/a&gt; stali členy &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/club/"&gt;klubu&lt;/a&gt;, nebo že &lt;a href="https://karierko.cz/clanek/honza-jak-se-muze-programovani-hodit-i-v-jinem-oboru-jak-najit-praci-v-it/"&gt;vyšel můj článek na Kariérku&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nastaveni-pythonu"&gt;Nastavení Pythonu&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#nastaveni-pythonu" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Už delší dobu jsem používal Python z Homebrew jako ten, ze kterého vytvářím virtuální prostředí, což &lt;a href="https://justinmayer.com/posts/homebrew-python-is-not-for-you/"&gt;není dobrý nápad&lt;/a&gt;. Bylo to proto, že na mojí &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/i-bought-apple-silicon"&gt;M1&lt;/a&gt; ze začátku nějak nefungoval pyenv, tak jsem to pouze zalepil skrze &lt;code&gt;brew pin python@3.9&lt;/code&gt;, aby se mi aspoň nerozbíjely virtuální prostředí.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ale teď už mě to dohánělo na každém kroku. Chtěl jsem něco přes Homebrew nainstalovat a napsalo mi to, že ne-é, že to bych nejdřív musel upgradnout i Python, jenže ten je připíchnutý na konkrétní verzi, takže mám smůlu, dokud ho neodpíchnu. Třeba &lt;a href="https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui"&gt;spotify-tui&lt;/a&gt; nebo &lt;a href="https://github.com/magic-wormhole/magic-wormhole"&gt;magic-wormhole&lt;/a&gt;. Takže jsem se do toho pustil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nakonec tím nejzásadnějším zjistěním bylo, že pyenv funguje, ale musí se podobně jako brew explicitně pustit pod správnou architekturou, jestliže jej mám nainstalovaný jako intelácký. Takže řešení je zhruba takovéto:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;alias&lt;/span&gt; brew-arm&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"arch -arm64e /opt/homebrew/bin/brew"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;alias&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;brew&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"arch -x86_64 /usr/local/bin/brew"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;alias&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;pyenv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"arch -x86_64 /usr/local/bin/pyenv"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Potom je pyenv schopen nainstalovat Python jaký potřebuju a pipenv je dokonce natolik inteligentní, že mu ani nemusím dávat žádné cesty a on si pro vytvoření virtuálního prostředí ten správný Python (tedy ten, který je specifikovaný v Pipfile) automaticky najde i v hloubi pyenvích adresářů. Tož to by bylo. Přeinstaloval jsem lokálně závislosti JG a vše funguje skvěle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dopisovani"&gt;Dopisování&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dopisovani" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tento týden jsem hodně času věnoval komunikaci a posouvání různých rozjednaných dohod vpřed. A to jsem se ani nezvládl ještě připomenout všem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jak jsem psal, &lt;a href="https://lynt.cz/"&gt;Lynt&lt;/a&gt; se stali členy &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/club/"&gt;klubu&lt;/a&gt;, takže jsem přidával logo na web, vytvářel fakturu, kupón pro registraci, apod.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poslal jsem Smitiu nápady na anketní otázky, kdybychom spolu dělali anketu mezi juniory. Uvidíme, jestli se na něčem nakonec domluvíme.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odpověděl jsem jedné větší korporaci. Krůček za krůčkem jsme blíž faktuře a spolupráci, ale asi to dá ještě hodně práce a hlavně to bude trvat hodně času.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Čekám na odpověď z jedné větší firmy, která chce do klubu, kde je můj kontakt zaneprázdněn různými nemocemi apod., ale připomenul jsem se.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Při řešení odmlky u jedné z firem jsem zjistil, že jim moje e-maily konzistentně padají do spamu. Také mi někdo psal, že e-maily z Memberful na Seznamu padají konzistentně do spamu, ale to bych ještě pochopil (a zatím jsem neměl sílu to řešit). Toto byly maily, které jsem ručně napsal a poslal z Gmailu. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1372123172837941251"&gt;Díky Twitteru&lt;/a&gt; jsem ale přišel na příčinu a snad jsem to i opravil. Bylo to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1372166349284331525"&gt;kvůli chybějícímu SPF&lt;/a&gt;. Já tedy doteď nevěděl, že něco jako SPF existuje, tak jsem zase o kousek moudřejší. V odkazovaných Twitter vláknech najdete kdyžtak i různé články a nástroje, které věc vysvětlují nebo ukazují spam skóre vašeho e-mailu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diskutoval jsem poctivě s členy v klubu :) Kromě běžné aktivity jsem se snažil nově oslovovat lidi, kteří se registrují do klubu a napíšou o sobě něco v místnosti #ahoj. Stává se, že se tam člověk představí, ale pak neví, kde začít nebo kde se zapojit, tak si vždy přečtu co napsali, co dělají, co řeší a zkouším je trochu vtáhnout do dění tím, že na jejich představení navážu. Zatím to vypadá funkčně, ale jak dlouho to vydržím dělat a kdo to bude dělat když budu na dovolené, to nevím :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V poslední době je v módě nadávat na překomplikovaný frontend. Kromě článku o Rails a WebSockets, který jsem sdílel na Pocketu (viz níže), se mi k tématu hodně líbil &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/RichardWestenra/status/1371498876880969732"&gt;tento tweet&lt;/a&gt;, protože naprosto vyjadřuje směr, jakým jdu i já. Ať si je frontend klidně komplikovaný, ale na projektech, na nichž se vyšívá každý den. U komunitních nebo osobních projektů, které takovou neustálou pozornost mít nemohou, platí pravidlo čím méně komplikovaných technologií, tím lépe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přeskupil jsem na Discordu klubu různé kanály podle toho, jak je lidé (ne)používají.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Udělal jsem v klubu anketu o tom, kdy se lidem nejvíc hodí „chodit“ na přednášky. Vychází z ní (zatím) středy 18h.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V rámci příprav na překopání úvodní stránky JG jsem přidal na stránku s motivací &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/motivation/#stories"&gt;sekci, kde jsou vypsány všechny motivační příběhy&lt;/a&gt;. Nejsem s tím takto 100 % spokojen, ale kdybych potřeboval z úvodní stránky příběhy vyhodit nebo jich zobrazit jen pár, tak to teď můžu udělat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Připravoval jsem podklady pro daňové přiznání a komunikoval s daňařem, který mi jej dělá.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mergnul jsem skript Míly Votradovce, který stahuje zálohy JG dat z CircleCI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na Memberful jsem si vypnul e-mailovou notifikaci ke každé události. Vypadá to, že už vše funguje jak má, tak jsem si nechal posílat už jen weekly summary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odehrála se další schůze výboru &lt;a href="https://pyvec.org/"&gt;Pyvce&lt;/a&gt;. Vylekalo nás, že už za rok by měly být volby do výboru. Asi bychom tedy měli konečně do &lt;a href="https://docs.pyvec.org/operations/"&gt;dokumentace&lt;/a&gt; doplnit, jak že se vlastně do výboru volí.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Všiml jsem si, že existuje fráze „úvod do programování“, na kterou ve vyhledávačích vyskočí všechny známé firmy kromě JG. A opravdu, tato slova na webu nikde nemám. Takže jsem je vrazil aspoň do titulku &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/learn/"&gt;stránky o učení&lt;/a&gt;. Jestli to něco udělá, to nevím.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spammeři si občas vymyslí nějaký e-mail a píšou mi na něj, třeba jsem@honzajavorek.cz, ačkoliv takovou adresu nikde nepoužívám. Jenže mi to dojde, dojde mi cokoliv zavináč doména. Udělal jsem si tedy v mailu filter, který mi barevně označí zprávy, které jsou adresovány na e-mail, jenž veřejně nikde nepoužívám. Díky tomu hned vidím, že to je asi spíš spam a nezatěžuji se čtením nebo odpovídáním. Zatím jsem neměl odvahu to tím filtrem i rovnou mazat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Už dříve jsem přemýšlel, že bych do poznámek přidal vždy i jednu větu o tom, jak moc jsem se zvládl během uplynulého týdne hýbat, ale odradila mě složitost autorizace do Strava API. Protože jsem měl tento týden jeden velký běžecký úspěch, vrátil jsem se k tomu a během dneška tomu dal nějakou tu hodinku programování. Výsledkem je jeden &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/honzajavorek.cz/blob/b91bcadf4dba7e83a37d431b5d78103c4b7a267c/strava.py"&gt;nahrubo splácaný skript&lt;/a&gt; v podstatě podle &lt;a href="https://medium.com/swlh/using-python-to-connect-to-stravas-api-and-analyse-your-activities-dummies-guide-5f49727aac86"&gt;tohoto článku&lt;/a&gt; a pár drobných úprav ve skriptu na generování šablony článku s poznámkami. Následující odrážka je ukázkou, jak vypadá výsledek. Třeba ji později doplním i do starých poznámek, ať nad tím při zpětném čtení ve stáří mohu uronit slzu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 7 dní od 13.3. do 19.3. jsem naběhal 29 km, při procházkách nachodil 13 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 6 hodin a zdolal při tom 42 kilometrů. Obvzláště hrdý jsem na devatenáctikilometrový běh, což je vzdálenost, kterou jsem uběhl naposledy odhadem tak před 14 lety.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="co-planuji"&gt;Co plánuji&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#co-planuji" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tři věci, které bych chtěl zvládnout udělat příště:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Redesignovat úvodní stránku tak, aby naváděla lidi do klubu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rozběhat nahrávání obrazovky s OBS na macOS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doručit jednotlivé papíry z DPFO jednotlivým institucím. Běžně k tomu využívám poštu, ale třeba by to byla příležitost odzimovat kolo?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-co-vy"&gt;A co vy?&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#a-co-vy" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud byste čistě náhodou měli dojem, že jste oproti mě za uplynulý týden vůbec nic nestihli, tak mám pro vás skvělou zprávu! V klidu se na ten dojem &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/neni-to-zavod/"&gt;můžete vykašlat&lt;/a&gt;. Není zač!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="co-me-zaujalo"&gt;Co mě zaujalo&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#co-me-zaujalo" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když si něco přečtu nebo poslechnu a líbí se mi to, &lt;a href="https://getpocket.com/@honzajavorek"&gt;sdílím to na Pocketu&lt;/a&gt;. Od posledních poznámek jsem sdílel toto:&lt;/p&gt;

Smál jsem se s kamarádem, že mi nikdo neřekl, že když udělám službu nejlevnější jak jen to jde, tak se z ní pak nedají moc snadno dávat slevy. Ale budiž :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Napsal jsem &lt;a href="https://www.czechitas.cz/"&gt;Czechitas&lt;/a&gt; (rozhodly se nesdílet to), &lt;a href="https://www.femmepalette.com/"&gt;Femme Palette&lt;/a&gt; (vyšlo), &lt;a href="https://cybermagnolia.com/"&gt;CyberMagnolia&lt;/a&gt; (vyšlo), &lt;a href="https://holkyzmarketingu.cz/"&gt;#holkyzmarketingu&lt;/a&gt; (poděkovaly, ale nevím, jestli to nakonec někde sdílely), &lt;a href="https://reactgirls.cz/"&gt;ReactGirls&lt;/a&gt; (vyšlo), &lt;a href="https://pyladies.cz/"&gt;PyLadies&lt;/a&gt; (vyšlo), Women of OCI/Oracle (reakce spíš nic), &lt;a href="https://ajtyvit.sk/"&gt;Aj Ty v IT&lt;/a&gt; (ghostnuli mě, ale nezlobím se, neznáme se, nemám s nimi žádné další vztahy, mohl jsem působit jako náhodný internetový spam). Byť se to Czechitas rozhodly nesdílet skrze své hlavní kanály, dal jsem to aspoň do FB skupiny Czechitas Příležitosti, kde mi příspěvek schválili. Nutno také podotknout, že jsem většinu kontaktoval na poslední chvíli, tzn. zhruba 2-3 pracovní dny před akcí. Pokud jsou další komunity pro ženy, na které jsem zapomněl, je to prostě jen proto, že je neznám.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aj Ty v IT jsem díky tomuto začal sledovat na LinkedIn a jsou naprosto boží. Kdysi jsem je zaznamenal na &lt;a href="https://pycon.sk/"&gt;PyCon SK&lt;/a&gt;, ale dále jsem je nesledoval. Teď občas zahlédnu jejich příspěvky a celkem mě to baví. Přijde mi, že netrpí oněmi drobnými nedostatky, které občas vidím &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/967870373283278/permalink/5032095890194019/"&gt;jinde&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Převážně díky této akci se do klubu přidalo plus mínus 25 lidí. Jestli všichni zůstanou i po dvou týdnech, to se samozřejmě teprve uvidí. Navíc to zažehlo užší spolupráci s &lt;a href="https://cybermagnolia.com/"&gt;CyberMagnolia&lt;/a&gt;. Chtěl jsem v &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/club/"&gt;klubu&lt;/a&gt; rozjet přednášky a tak jsme se rovnou domluvili, že první bude mít &lt;a href="https://dariagrudzien.com/"&gt;Daria&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="prednasky-v-klubu"&gt;Přednášky v klubu&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#prednasky-v-klubu" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Po prvním pokusu o sraz v klubu jsem přemýšlel, jak to udělat lépe a možná jinak, než způsobem, jakým probíhají běžné srazy. Jednak jim nechci konkurovat, jednak je takový sraz náročný na organizaci a vlastně nevím, jestli se pro klub hodí. Chci, aby klub bylo takové to, co vám každý den bublá na pozadí, kde vám někdo odpoví na dotaz, tu a tam se dovíte něco nového… Napadlo mě, že nějaký koncept „jednorázových přednášek“, které budou odlehčenější a častější, mohl vyhovovat více. Prostě jednou za týden nebo dva bude večer přednáška, bude trvat hodinu maximálně a šmitec. Nenáročné na organizaci, nenáročné pro lidi. Ne každý chce celý večer strávit na srazu, takhle se něco doví a když bude chtít, může si pak podívat, ale oficiální program to už nebude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Večerní tematické přednášky jsou vždy předem oznámeny na konkrétní datum a čas. Pokud chceš přednášku slyšet, připoj se v ten čas do hlasové místnosti #klubovna. Po skončení přednášky není žádný další oficiální program. Cílem je, aby přednášky byly spíše rychlé a časté, než plánované do celovečerních bloků. Tak nezaberou příliš mnoho času a můžeš se připojit, i když máš nabitý den, nebo prostě jen nechceš trávit celý večer na nějakém srazu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud si chceš povídat, můžeš po přednášce zůstat v místnosti #klubovna, stejně jako to jde i kdykoliv jindy. Není to ale už součástí programu, takže tohoto povídání se nemusí účastnit organizátoři a diskuze není moderovaná.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;První přednáška bude v úterý v 18:00 večer, detaily jsou &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/events/"&gt;tady&lt;/a&gt;. To je mimochodem stránka, kterou jsem věděl, že chci vytvořit hezčí, ale plácal jsem se přes ruce, abych ji neudělal ani složitější na straně backendu, ani hezčí, protože jsem na to vlastně neměl vůbec tento týden čas. Chtěl jsem udělat YML soubor s daty, uložit to do databáze, vypisovat to na víc místech, mít tam fotku Darii. Ale to je moc práce. Zakázal jsem si to, YML soubor po 15 minutách jeho existence v mém editoru smazal, a stránku jsem vyrobil nejjednodušším způsobem - prostě jsem ji napsal jako čisté HTML. Vůbec s tím nejsem spokojený, ale je to hotové a informace tam jsou. Dále se tím můžu zabývat, až těch přednášek bude pět. Na stránku jsem dal také návod pro přednášející. Vlastně jsem jen sepsal věci, které jsem psal Darii a na které se mě sama ptala :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yablko"&gt;yablko&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#yablko" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Svérázný slovenský lektor &lt;a href="http://robweb.sk"&gt;yablko&lt;/a&gt; mi udělal super reklamu hned v několika videích a mě se líbí i jiná jeho videa, takže jsem vzal &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhB6F20C-jTPITEXEHus6fVZDfNxzRbv_"&gt;tento playlist&lt;/a&gt; a přemýšlel, kam všude na JG by se dala jeho videa nacpat. Dělal jsem to po večerech v průběhu celého týdne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mrkl jsem na &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v5K4GvK4Gs"&gt;video o Gitu&lt;/a&gt; a taky se mi líbilo, takže jsem jej přidal do &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/practice/"&gt;sekce o Gitu a GitHubu&lt;/a&gt;. Jenže jak už jsem u té sekce byl, tak jsem ji musel celou přepsat. Nejsem s ní ještě úplně spokojený, ale asi je to lepší, než bylo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Další videa jsem dal do &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/candidate-handbook/"&gt;příručky o hledání práce&lt;/a&gt;. Na začátek jsem dal celý kolotoč jeho videí. Pak jsem chtěl dát různá videa do různých míst na webu, ale nevěděl jsem jak, protože to bylo vždy jedno video tu a jedno tam, a na to se úplně nehodí takový ten můj boxíkový seznam. Takže nakonec jsem to vyřešil tím, že jsem odcitoval různé yablkovy výroky a u nich jsou odkazy na jeho videa, plus jsem hodil občas nějaký odkaz i do textu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Řešil jsem hlavně dva zapeklité problémy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nechtěl jsem yablka překládat (akože kde to sme, slovenčina je predsa okej, to nebudem prekládať! kto nerozumie, má smôlu, ať sa naučí, bratia sú bratia), ale on ty věci na videu &lt;em&gt;říká&lt;/em&gt; a já je potřebuji na web &lt;em&gt;napsat&lt;/em&gt;. Takže jsem vždy nějak zhruba odhadl, jak by se to mohlo slovensky psát a snad se bratia ozvou, pokud je to blbě. Mám z SK hromadu kámošů, takže mám průpravu a snad to bude dobře, ale v pátek odpoledne nikdo z kámošů nebyl online, takže jsem je nemohl poprosit o kontrolu. Pokud někde narazíte na chybu, dejte vědět. (Tak už to jeden kámoš viděl a prý to vypadá, jako když se Babiš snaží mluvit česky… OK no, tolik k mojí slovenčině.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stránky s YT videi se nedají moc screenshotovat a moje boxíky s odkazy jsou na screenshotech založené. Řešil jsem to už u odkazů &lt;a href="https://brona.cz/"&gt;Broňova&lt;/a&gt; videa, ale to bylo asi tak jedno video, tak jsem ho udělal ručně. Teď jsem toho potřeboval víc. Když se ale můj &lt;a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/pageres-cli"&gt;nástroj na sceenshoty&lt;/a&gt; snaží vyfotit YT stránku, je tam spousta jakýchsi dialogů a do videa se navíc načte reklama místo yablka nebo Broni, takže je to úplně na nic. Naštěstí každé YT video má cover obrázek na adrese &lt;code&gt;"https://img.youtube.com/vi/&amp;lt;KÓD VIDEA&amp;gt;/maxresdefault.jpg"&lt;/code&gt;, který je vlastně i mnohem lepší, než by byl screenshot. Takže jsem upravil svůj screenshotovací skript tak, aby se pro YT odkazy díval rovnou po tomto obrázku a je to super.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S.: Napadlo mě, že člověk, který kontroluje, zda je text zapsaný správně slovensky, by se mohl nazývat &lt;em&gt;grammar kotleba&lt;/em&gt;. No nic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="plzenske-pyvo"&gt;Plzeňské Pyvo&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#plzenske-pyvo" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Během týdne mě oslovili z &lt;a href="https://pyvo.cz/plzen-pyvo/"&gt;Plzeňského Pyva&lt;/a&gt;, jestli nechci mít &lt;em&gt;lightning talk&lt;/em&gt; o JG. Souhlasil jsem a tak jsem se poprvé konečně účastnil Pyva v Plzni. Připravoval jsem si to půl hodiny před začátkem a tak mě potěšilo, když mi řekli, že nemusím přísně dodržet limit 5 minut. Snad se to líbilo, vypíchl jsem hlavně to, že aby měl člověk praxi, musí hlavně programovat na reálných projektech a že by se měl obklopit lidmi, aby měl pomoc a motivaci. Sraz samotný byl fajn, 55+ účastníků, což je pecka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S online meetupy je problém v tom, že přednášky se často mění v uspávání hadů a člověk si nemůže odskočit za roh a povídat si tam s kamarády. Stejně tak je náročná následující diskuze, kde se nedají vytvořit „skupinky“ podle toho, co koho zajímá a kdo je komu sympatický. Nevydržel jsem do konce Plzeňského Pyva, ale koncept přednášek ve stylu „dialogu“ mě zaujal. Mintaka občas skočil do přednášky s otázkou nebo konentářem - jakože normálně by to bylo divný, ale v onlinu mi to překvapivě vůbec nevadí a působí to živěji, jako kdyby to mělo našlápnuto k rozhovoru nebo nějakýmu podcastu. Zajímavé koncepty, inspirace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pocitani-penez"&gt;Počítání peněz&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#pocitani-penez" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Měl jsem furt nějakou depku z toho, že klub nevydělává dost a dost rychle. Byl jsem se s kafem v ruce projít do zimy s kamarádkou, kterou jsem dlouho neviděl a ta se mě zeptala, proč si to pořádně nespočítám. Nevěděl jsem. Měl jsem pocit, že to není důležité a nespěchá to, ale důležité to bylo, už jen kvůli psychické pohodě. Té nepomáhá, že čas mi totiž běží „startupově“ a já mám pocit, jako by už klub existoval rok, i když existuje měsíc a půl. Za ten měsíc a půl mám skoro 4000 Kč MRR čistě z klubu a zhruba 120 lidí v klubu, což není vůbec špatný.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spočítal jsem to ale všechno pořádně, včetně faktur firmám, donations atd. a opravil svou Google Sheets tabulku a teď jsem už o dost šťastnější a klidnější a veselejší. Mám před sebou ještě hromadu práce, ale myslím, že je to na dobré cestě. Jak mi GitHub Sponsors přestanou znásobovat příspěvky, tak mi odhadem asi o 3000 Kč spadne celkové MRR, které je teď kolem 8500 Kč, ale i tak je to MRR myslím už na pěkné cestě. A MRR je ten pevný každoměsíční základ, který je důležitý. Celkově jsem od začátku roku 2021 vydělal (čistého) 45900 Kč, což rozpočítáno na měsíce vychází na 20000 Kč, ale nedá se to tak úplně brát, protože v tom jsou třeba faktury za něco, co je jakože předplaceno na rok dopředu. Nevím úplně, jak je mám započítávat, protože se mi nechce u každé platby evidovat, na kolik měsíců se má rozpočítávat a od kdy do kdy, a pak to nějak složitě do té tabulky promítnout ve výpočtech. Takže výdělek zatím jen dělím počtem měsíců, ale je mi pak jasné, že to zkresluje čísla. I proto je to MRR prostě nejdůležitější číslo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V klubu jsem nadhodil, jaké otázky by mohly být v průzkumu mezi juniory, který bych mohl dělat se Smitio. Pokud by vás také něco napadlo, budu rád za nápady.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kamarád Jakub Mrozek, velký fanoušek těchto poznámek a &lt;a href="https://jakubmrozek.cz/knihy.html"&gt;čtenář knih&lt;/a&gt;, nakoukl do klubu a napsal mi: "Ty diskuze jsou úžasné. Když to lidi zaplatí, tak je tam úplně jiná diskuze. Extrémně kultivovaná, srozumitelná, každý příspěvek má smysl."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Řádil jsem na sociálních sítích, propagoval chystanou přednášku (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1369979791777095680"&gt;grafiku&lt;/a&gt; jsem zbastlil v mém oblíbeném „grafickém editoru” Keynote a hrdý na ni nějak moc nejsem), plánoval přes &lt;a href="https://buffer.com/"&gt;Buffer&lt;/a&gt; příspěvky na další týdny. Po delší pauze myslím, že je čas přitlačit na marketingu. Když jsem zaplnil celou frontu, nedalo mi to a klikl jsem na tlačítko, že vyzkouším Pro verzi Bufferu za ~300 Kč měsíčně. Doteď jsem tak dlouhou frontu neměl a Instagram (čtvrtý účet, zdarma jsou jen tři) jsem řešil přes separátní účet na jiný mail, abych to jakože obešel. Ale byznys už něco vydělává a marketing musí bejt, takže teda asi začnu platit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aktualizoval jsem některé seznamy a drobné texty na JG. Přidal jsem &lt;a href="https://reactgirls.cz/mentoring"&gt;ReactGirls Mentoring&lt;/a&gt;, aktualizoval ReactGirls screenshot, upravil odkazy aby vedly na jejich nové stránky, atd.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přečetl jsem si &lt;a href="https://cybermagnolia.com/blog/lenka-segura-interview/"&gt;rozhovor s Lenkou Segura&lt;/a&gt; a pecka, hned jsem ji přidal do příběhů na JG a ještě ji na dvou místech odcitoval.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Narazil jsem na &lt;a href="https://vysocina.rozhlas.cz/pocitacum-se-puvodne-venovat-nechtela-pak-ji-ale-doslova-pohltila-umela-8442435"&gt;pokračování příbehu o baletce, která vytvořila chatbota&lt;/a&gt;! (Původní &lt;a href="https://imysleni.cz/clanky/novinka/208-z-baletky-programatorkou-chatbot-sestnactilete-divky-z-havlickova-brodu-usetri-lekarum-praci?utm_source=juniorguru&amp;amp;utm_medium=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=juniorguru"&gt;zde&lt;/a&gt;.) Také jsem to hned přidal do příběhů na JG.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kamarád &lt;a href="https://milavotradovec.cz/"&gt;Míla Votradovec&lt;/a&gt;, který se učí ML, se mě zeptal, jestli nemám na JG nějaká data, která by mohl zkoumat. Mám, tak jsem mu napsal, kde je najde. Nic od toho ani jeden nečekáme, ale &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/junior.guru/pull/492"&gt;už posílá první Pull Requesty&lt;/a&gt;, juch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na Česko.Digital postupně zpracovávají a snad brzy vydají článek, který sepsala členka klubu &lt;a href="https://martinahytychova.github.io/"&gt;Martina Hytychová&lt;/a&gt; o přispívání do Open Source jako začátečnice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tři věci, které bych chtěl zvládnout udělat příště:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Připravit podklady pro daňové přiznání.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Připravit vše na úterní klubovou přednášku.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přiblížit se k redesignu úvodní stránky tak, aby naváděla lidi do klubu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-co-vy"&gt;A co vy?&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#a-co-vy" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud byste čistě náhodou měli dojem, že jste oproti mě za uplynulý týden vůbec nic nestihli, tak mám pro vás skvělou zprávu! V klidu se na ten dojem &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/neni-to-zavod/"&gt;můžete vykašlat&lt;/a&gt;. Není zač!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obskurní kombinace z titulku těchto poznámek je pouze kreativní způsob, jak popsat týden, v němž jsem toho popravdě zas tak moc nestihl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zubaře mám na druhém konci republiky a návštěvu u něj jsem kvůli covidu-19 stále odsouval. Teď už jsme se se ženou konečně objednali, ale přišla nová omezení. Nakonec jsme se rozhodli cestu nezrušit, návštěva lékaře byla povolena a my už to fakt chtěli mít po tak dlouhé pauze za sebou. Vlaky prázdné, prohlášení nikdo nechtěl, zuby zdravé. Takže super.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jak už to tak někdy bývá, dlouho se neděje nic a pak se najednou děje všechno naráz. Takže hned druhý den přišli do našeho bytu týpci vyrubat a vyměnit okna. Během šesti hodin větrání, kdy se teplota v bytě ustálila na zhruba 12 stupňích, jsem se na práci moc soustředit nedokázal. Eskapismus mě zavedl na zajímavý &lt;a href="https://going-medieval.com/"&gt;blog o středověku&lt;/a&gt;, kde jsem přečetl asi deset článků (nasdílel jsem jen pár). Londýnská historička Eleanor Janega prolíná historii se současností, vyvrací různé mýty. Nebere si servítky a slova do článků z ní padají jak z naštvané raperky protestující proti celému světu. Pro někoho to asi nebude, mě to baví. Studovala Karla IV., Milíče z Kroměříže &amp;amp; &lt;em&gt;crew&lt;/em&gt;, takže se v článcích občas objeví i něco přímo z naší historie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="novy-uvod-do-programovani"&gt;Nový úvod do programování&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#novy-uvod-do-programovani" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Během dneška jsem přepracoval úvod na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/learn/"&gt;stránce o základech&lt;/a&gt;, kapitolu „Co budeš potřebovat“. Místo dvou odstavců je tam to teď o dost delší, jde to víc do hloubky:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://junior.guru/learn/#equipment"&gt;Vybavení, které musíš mít&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://junior.guru/learn/#friends"&gt;Sežeň si kamarády&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://junior.guru/learn/#prerequisities"&gt;Co je dobré umět předem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://junior.guru/learn/#price"&gt;Kolik to bude stát&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://junior.guru/learn/#time"&gt;Kolik času potřebuješ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://junior.guru/learn/#learning"&gt;Nauč se učit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://junior.guru/learn/#myths"&gt;Co nepotřebuješ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oddech-od-socialnich-siti"&gt;Oddech od sociálních sítí&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#oddech-od-socialnich-siti" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Z problémů kolem koronaviru mi už začalo trochu šibat. Po nahlédnutí do &lt;a href="https://www.kosmas.cz/knihy/255618/sisu/"&gt;knihy o sisu&lt;/a&gt; jsem si myšlenky tam zmíněné v hlavě spojil s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wzg6-imIReo"&gt;tímto rozborem filmu Marťan&lt;/a&gt; a došlo mi, že stále věci kolem viru vnímám velmi reaktivně a mohl bych se spíš zkusit přepnout do módu, kdy situaci vnímám jako nepřítele a byť je silnější než já, nevzdám se a pomocí guerilla války s ním budu vytrvale bojovat. Jako protiútoky, které se nabízí jako první jsem identifikoval:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zablokovat si sociální sítě a chodit na ně jen 1x týdně. Marketingové statusy posílám z &lt;a href="https://publish.buffer.com/"&gt;Bufferu&lt;/a&gt; a na případné komentáře mohu reagovat i se zpožděním. Dnes jsem si je od pondělí poprvé odblokoval, ale ještě jsem na nich ani nebyl. Jen jsem si všiml, že na Facebooku mám 20+ notifikací :D&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restartovat pravidelné cvičení, aspoň protahování nebo tak něco. To se zatím nepovedlo. Aspoň běhám.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dopřát si dostatek spánku, dělat si věci hezký a neodbývat se, pečovat o sebe, o svůj vzhled atd. Toto se mi daří částečně.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zkusit chvíli nemyslet na nic a jen tak čumět třeba do stromů. Myslím, že se tomu občas říká meditace nebo tak něco. To se mi zatím nepovedlo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Klid bez sociálních sítí beru jako velký úspěch a hodlám v tom zatím pokračovat. Zpravodajství si blokovat nemusím, nevyvolává ve mě závislost a nechodím tam kompulzivně.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/club/"&gt;klubu&lt;/a&gt; jsme si vytvořili místnost, kam se každý může uchýlit, když ho něco potrápilo a může si tam ulevit. Jmenuje se #past-vedle-pasti.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přemýšlím, že místo pravidelných propracovaných a odhlasovaných meetupů bych začal v klubu organizovat zhruba jednou týdně nějakou večerní přednášku s expertem. Formát by byl asi takový, že bych na náhodný den oznámil přednášku experta pro klub, v ten den třeba v 18:00 by to začalo v klubovně, po přednášce by byly dotazy a pak konec ofiko akce. Celé tak na hodinku maximálně. Kdo by měl chuť, může si dál povídat v klubovně (jako si může i kdykoliv jindy), ale nebylo by zaručeno, že u toho budu já nebo že se to bude nějak moderovat. Bylo by to méně náročné na přípravu a možná by se to dalo snadněji sloučit s běžným životem, mým i ostatních členů klubu, než dělat třeba jednou za měsíc sraz v klasickém formátu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Napsal jsem všem firmám, od kterých jsem neměl odpověď, nebo kterým jsem odpověď dlužil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Řešil jsem registraci našeho týmu na &lt;a href="https://www.hrasendvic.cz/"&gt;Sendvič&lt;/a&gt; (tento víkend).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Věnoval jsem se několik hodin názorové výměně s dobrým kamarádem na feministická témata.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aktualizoval jsem seznamy na JG, které poskytují tipy na komunitní aktivity: &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/learn/#help"&gt;Kde najdeš pomoc&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/practice/#events"&gt;Najdi inspiraci, poznej lidi&lt;/a&gt;. Zmínil jsem covid-19, přidal jsem odkaz na klub, přidal jsem odkaz na Python Discord. Přemýšlel jsem, jestli nechat odkazy na Reddit, i když je považuji za fakt dobré zdroje, protože to v Česku moc nefrčí a většina lidí to asi přeskočí. Zatím jsem je tam nechal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google měl asi nějaké problémy s dostupností API a potom vydal novou verzi Python knihovny a ta nefungovala, takže se postaral o to, že jsem tomu věnoval čas a řešil, jestli je problém na mojí nebo na jejich straně.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/club/"&gt;stránku klubu&lt;/a&gt; jsem přidal výroky lidí. HTML a CSS už jsem měl hotové ze &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/hire-juniors/#handbook"&gt;stránky pro firmy&lt;/a&gt;, takže to byla věc na pár minut. Nepovažuju toto řešení vůbec za ideální, doporučení od lidí bych chtěl časem zobrazovat nějak lépe, ale mám co mám, zatím to musí stačit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diskutovali jsme možnosti nějakého partnerství se &lt;a href="https://smitio.com/"&gt;Smitio&lt;/a&gt;, ať už by šlo o článek nebo něco jiného.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Připravoval jsem na MDŽ (pondělí) slevu na členství v klubu pro komunity, které pomáhají ženám do IT. Psal jsem si se všemi a dolaďoval detaily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="co-planuji"&gt;Co plánuji&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#co-planuji" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tři věci, které bych chtěl zvládnout udělat příště:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na MDŽ propagovat slevu na členství v klubu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přiblížit se k redesignu úvodní stránky tak, aby naváděla lidi do klubu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Připravit podklady pro daňové přiznání. Blééééé.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonusy: Zvládnout &lt;a href="https://www.hrasendvic.cz/"&gt;Sendvič&lt;/a&gt; se ctí a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DivinityOriginalSin/comments/lxxz4x/weve_lost_sir_lora/"&gt;oživit Sira Loru&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-co-vy"&gt;A co vy?&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#a-co-vy" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud byste čistě náhodou měli dojem, že jste oproti mě za uplynulý týden vůbec nic nestihli, tak mám pro vás skvělou zprávu! V klidu se na ten dojem &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/neni-to-zavod/"&gt;můžete vykašlat&lt;/a&gt;. Není zač!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stejně jako minule se pokusím poznámky sepsat aspoň za hodinu. (Nakonec ještě za míň! Super.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nova-stranka"&gt;Nová stránka&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#nova-stranka" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Z několika předchozích týdenních poznámek šlo možná zachytit, že jsem do konce února slíbil napsat článek pro &lt;a href="https://karierko.cz/"&gt;Kariérko.cz&lt;/a&gt; a že jsem to trochu prokrastinoval. Poslední týden v únoru jsem se rozhodl, že budu prokrastinovat přidáním celé nové stránky na JG. Důvody:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obsah stránky by se měl významně překrývat s obsahem článku.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na nové úvodní stránce JG, kterou plánuji, nejspíš už nebude místo pro &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/#stories"&gt;příběhy&lt;/a&gt; a bylo by lepší, kdybych je mohl dát někam jinam a z úvodní stránky na ně případně jen odkázat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bod číslo jedna&lt;/strong&gt; se splnil nádherně. Stránku jsem sice psal několik dní, ale díky tomu jsem během dneška onen věčně prokrastinovaný článek zhotovil za pár hodin a bez velkého odsouvání. Měl jsem totiž už jasnou představu, co tam chci dát a mohl jsem recyklovat myšlenky, které jsem si týden skládal v hlavě.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bod číslo dvě&lt;/strong&gt; se zatím moc nesplnil. Příběhy jsem &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/junior.guru/blob/master/juniorguru/data/stories.yml"&gt;oštítkoval podle různých témat&lt;/a&gt;, abych je mohl podle štítků vypisovat přímo v kontextu jednotlivých odstavců nové stránky. To se mi dost líbí. Místo, kde by se ale příběhy vypisovaly všechny a kam by se přesunuly z úvodní stránky, zatím nevzniklo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nová stránka navazuje na odstavce, které byly dřív přímo na stránce &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/learn/"&gt;/learn/&lt;/a&gt;. Tyto odstavce jsem tvořil jako jedny z úplně prvních, když jsem zakládal JG. Byly založené na &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.github.io/jak-se-naucit-programovat/jak-se-naucit-programovat/"&gt;mé dávné prezentaci&lt;/a&gt; pro brněnské (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8DYsKDz63Y"&gt;archivní video&lt;/a&gt;) a později myslím i ostravské Pyvo. Bylo v rámci možností krátké a stručné, ale dnes to vidím spíš tak, že to bylo zkratkovité a víc textu si to prostě zasloužilo. Spojil jsem to s myšlenkami, které jsem už dřív formuloval do &lt;a href="https://nazory.ihned.cz/c7-66842510-ofofc-cf514314230baa8"&gt;článku pro Hospodářky&lt;/a&gt; a s dalšími svými poznámkami. Zpracoval jsem v krátkých kapitolách i „No Code“, Excel, &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/motivation/#kids"&gt;programování pro děti&lt;/a&gt; nebo programování CNC, aby byl jasnější kontext JG a lidé, kteří hledají možná trochu něco jiného, aby to našli. Jsem rád, že i po všech těchto úpravách se mi povedlo v textu zachovat slovo penis, které vím, že lidi vždy hned zaujalo, hlavně novináře. Psaní a úpravy těchto textů mi zabralo drtivou většinu tohoto týdne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Koukal jsem na &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-wsqhCK-wU"&gt;yablkovo nové video&lt;/a&gt;, kde několikrát zmiňuje JG. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1365023949176909833"&gt;Láska!&lt;/a&gt; Napadlo mě, že slovenské nabídky práce napsané v angličtině bych vlastně mohl do JG přidat snadno. Naprogramovat podporu pro slovenčinu do mého filtrovacího robota je hodně práce, ale angličtinu už dávno umí, tak lepší než nic. Taky bych chtěl yablkova videa dát konečně na vhodná místa příručky, to už plánuju dlouho.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dělal jsem kamarádovi Mílovi review &lt;a href="https://milavotradovec.cz/blog/pairing-makes-better-interviews-than-leetcode/"&gt;článku o pohovorech v IT&lt;/a&gt;. Téma se mi líbilo a přišlo mi hezky zpracované, takže jsem jej vyhajpoval, že bude mít určitě úspěch na HackerNews. Dostalo to &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26238905"&gt;tři hlasy&lt;/a&gt;. Nepomohl ani vzhled jeho blogu, který nápadně připomíná &lt;a href="https://daringfireball.net/"&gt;Daring Fireball&lt;/a&gt;. Příště zkusíme titulek "I didn't buy Apple Silicon".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Začal jsem na sociální sítě dávat první ohlasy lidí na klub (viz předešlé poznámky). Vytvořil jsem si v Keynote čtvercové slajdy, na kterých jsou citáty lidí a dole je zcela nevkusně vycentrovaný žlutý pruh s kuřetem a URL na klub. Pro každý výrok mám jeden slajd a pak to dávám exportovat do PNG obrázků. Z toho designu mi trochu krvácí oči, ale nechtěl jsem tomu zatím věnovat víc času.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do podmenu příručky jsem vrátil čísla 1 2 3, která kvůli změnám v minulém týdnu zmizela. Nová stránka pak dostala číslo 0, na což mi investorka řekla, že je to takové hezky programátorské :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jedna personálka se mi ozvala, jestli spolu něco nevymyslíme. Tak jsem si s nimi psal a vymýšlím, co vymyslíme.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psal jsem si s Vladlenou a vyzvídal, jak získala práci. Napsala totiž na Facebook „Díky junior.guru klubu jsem si za dva týdny sehnala práci ;) Děkuji!“ Z takovýchto úspěchů mám hroznou radost a dává mi to víru, že to co dělám, dává fakt smysl &amp;lt;3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přidal jsem &lt;a href="https://www.podnikatel.cz/clanky/na-kvetinove-farme-vsazeji-na-cerstvost-a-lokalnost-jak-jejich-byznys-funguje/"&gt;svého bývalého kolegu z Apiary&lt;/a&gt; do &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/#stories"&gt;příběhů&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Napsal jsem do Romea, že pokud by věděli o někom, komu by můj klub pomohl, tak ať dají vědět a domluvíme se.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sem tam jsem mrknul na Slack &lt;a href="https://cesko.digital/"&gt;Česko.Digital&lt;/a&gt; jak se to má s pozicemi nebo s článkem (viz předešlé poznámky). S článkem se to vyvíjí dobře, nejspíš opravdu vyjde u nich na blogu!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poslal jsem dnes &lt;a href="https://us3.campaign-archive.com/?u=7d3f89ef9b2ed953ddf4ff5f6&amp;amp;id=0084d29320"&gt;únorový newsletter&lt;/a&gt;, tentokrát dokonce už v únoru :D&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="co-planuji"&gt;Co plánuji&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#co-planuji" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tři věci, které bych chtěl zvládnout udělat příště:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Komunikovat s firmami. Připomenout se těm, se kterými jsem si psal dřív a nemám odezvu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doladit sekci &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/learn/#requirements"&gt;Co budeš potřebovat?&lt;/a&gt; (Chystám se to trochu překopat. Mírně asi vykradu i Petrovy požadavky na kurz: &lt;a href="https://naucse.python.cz/2021/online-jaro/adm/intro/"&gt;text&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so10Ud-YlKE&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pokračovat v marketingu, rozhýbávání klubu a přemýšlení nad novou úvodní stránkou JG.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-co-vy"&gt;A co vy?&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#a-co-vy" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud byste čistě náhodou měli dojem, že jste oproti mě za uplynulý týden vůbec nic nestihli, tak mám pro vás skvělou zprávu! V klidu se na ten dojem &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/neni-to-zavod/"&gt;můžete vykašlat&lt;/a&gt;. Není zač!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="co-me-zaujalo"&gt;Co mě zaujalo&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#co-me-zaujalo" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když si něco přečtu nebo poslechnu a líbí se mi to, &lt;a href="https://getpocket.com/@honzajavorek"&gt;sdílím to na Pocketu&lt;/a&gt;. Od posledních poznámek jsem sdílel toto:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Psaním poznámek jsem v poslední době trávil stále větší část pátku. Došlo to tak daleko, že musela zasáhnout investorka a jemně mi naznačit, že produkuji dlouhé texty, které nemůže nikdo zvládat číst, a že mi už psaní zabírá půl pracovního dne. Rád bych se tedy dneškem začal učit poznámky zestručňovat a zkracovat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Poznámka: Dnes nakonec trvalo napsání a vypublikování jen hodinu! Juch!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="klub-zacina-vydelavat"&gt;Klub začíná vydělávat&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#klub-zacina-vydelavat" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Členové &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/club/"&gt;klubu&lt;/a&gt; mají přístup 14 dní zdarma, na vyzkoušení. Tento týden tato doba uplynula u prvních členů a tak se na účtě objevily první peníze. V tento okamžik jsem na téměř 3000 Kč MRR (&lt;em&gt;monthly recurring revenue&lt;/em&gt;), ale v tomto číslu nejsou započítány žádné příjmy od firem, které jdou bokem přes faktury, je to pouze číslo z Memberful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S Memberful jsem také řešil první problém. O víkendu jsem zjistil, že někteří lidé dostávají e-maily se zprávou, která nedává v kontextu jejich účtu smysl. Napsal jsem jim na support, ale jsou z USA, takže jsem věděl, že odpoví nejdříve v pondělí večer. Mezitím jsem každý den postižené členy osobně obepisoval a omlouval se jim. V pondělí večer jsem zjistil, co je za problém: Memberful počítá &lt;em&gt;free trial&lt;/em&gt; jako samostatné předplatné, takže pokud si někdo vypnul automatické prodlužování předplatného ještě předtím, než skončil jeho &lt;em&gt;trial&lt;/em&gt;, tak by se nepřehouplo do plného předplatného vyžadujícího kartu, ale prostě by skončilo. Tomu odpovídaly i rozesílané e-maily. Já jsem navíc měl u ročního předplatného jako výchozí možnost nastaveno neprodlužování, takže to postihlo všechny, kdo měli roční předplatné.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memberful má skvělý support a vše jsme si nějak vysvětlili. Stále si myslím, že je to bug nebo možná spíš nesmysl či neošetřený &lt;em&gt;corner case&lt;/em&gt; na jejich straně, ale shodli jsme se, že stačí pár změn na mé straně a není co řešit. Moje roční předplatné se bude odteď automaticky prodlužovat, ale před tím, než se to stane, se pošle e-mail, který na to upozorňuje. I kdyby přesto někdo protestoval, že se strhlo další předplatné, mohu mu vrátit peníze jedním tlačítkem. Co se týče prvních 14 dní, tam už vůbec nehrozí nikomu nic, protože karta se do systému zadává až ve chvíli, kdy &lt;em&gt;trial&lt;/em&gt; vyprší a člověk jde fakt platit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="prvni-ohlasy"&gt;První ohlasy&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#prvni-ohlasy" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Začínám sbírat i první ohlasy na klub. Zatím je nemám nikde na webu. tak jen takto:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mně přijde, že je celkově dost problém najít komunitu, která je fakt o nějaký vzájemný pomoci a výměně informací, než o honění ega.. Dost často se právě setkávám s tím, že se někdo na něco zeptá a dostane akorát výsměch, nebo odpověď "Google", případně třeba odpověď k tématu, ale s takovou zvláštní příměsí nadřazenosti.. Nevím no. Proto mám třeba i radši víc ženský skupiny. Tam mi přijde, že to tolik nevídám. Ale tady je to třeba krásná výjimka. Jsem fakt ráda, že toho můžu být součástí.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Co mě vždy jako kluka z vesnice na programování nejvíce štvalo, bylo to, že jsem na to byl vždycky hrozně moc sám. Proto jsem opravdu vděčný za tuto komunitu, jednak Honzovi, ale i vám ostatním, co tu jste.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dneska jsem si potvrdila, ze nacpat se sem do klubu je moc dobrej napad. Krome toho, ze podporim Honzu a celej tenhle projekt, coz jsem stejne mela v planu, je to pro me i pri soucasnem vicemene "pasivnim" pouzivani takova ta jemne popostrkujici a nejakou cinnost vyvolavajici a podnecujici sila, kterou jsem potrebovala.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ahoj, tak jsem dostal ten job! Ty na tom máš obrovský podíl! Musím ti za to ohromně poděkovat!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="prepracovavani-webu"&gt;Přepracovávání webu&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#prepracovavani-webu" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minulé poznámky byly z velké části o tom, jak uvažuji o přepracování webu. Přes víkend jsem se ale umoudřil, obrazně se profackoval a zakázal si cokoliv z toho dělat. Utopil bych v tom moře času a JG prostě ještě není v situaci, kdy si může nějaké velké přepisování dovolit. Šel bych proti všem poučkám SW inženýrství - nedělej radikálni &lt;em&gt;redesign&lt;/em&gt;, nedělej &lt;em&gt;rewrite&lt;/em&gt;, nerezignuj na &lt;em&gt;continuous delivery&lt;/em&gt;… Navíc, jaká je odpověď na otázku "co teď potřebuju nejvíc"? Odpověď je "co nejvíc spokojených členů &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/club/"&gt;klubu&lt;/a&gt;." Jaká k tomu vede nejkratší cesta? Rozhodně ne přes nějaké přepisování webu. Rozhodl jsem se preferovat chirurgické zásahy, které udělají 80 % parády s 20 % úsilí:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Změnil jsem strukturu menu tak, aby odrážela budoucí strukturu webu. Nezměnil jsem při tom jediné URL, vše se odehrálo pouze v menu. Nyní jsou všechny obsahové stránky pohromadě pod odkazem "příručka", pak je odkaz "práce" s nabídkami a ceníkem pro firmy, pak je "klub". &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/candidate-handbook/"&gt;Příručka o hledání první práce v IT&lt;/a&gt; je teď třetí krok, ten původně mířil na nabídky práce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Až po několika dnech jsem si všiml, že změna výše kompletně rozbila menu na mobilech. Opravil jsem dnes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na homepage je nyní místo "průvodce programováním pro začátečníky" slogan "klub pro začátečníky v programování" a i na jiných místech jsem začal o JG mluvit jako o klubu místo o průvodci.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ze všech stránek kromě obsahových (příručkových) jsem odstranil &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/donate/"&gt;výzvu k dobrovolným příspěvkům&lt;/a&gt;. Až začně klub vydělávat víc, odstraním ji zcela, ale zatím na to nemám kuráž.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dnes jsem se pokusil upravit hlavní menu i graficky. Není to výkvět designu, ale cílem bylo, aby tlačítka vypadala spíše jako odkazy a klub vypadal jako tlačítko, které chytá za oči. To by mohlo dále zvýšit počty příchozích na stránku s klubem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V pátek jsem si přece jenom ale zkusil ještě něco zjistit o MkDocs, četl jsem si &lt;a href="https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/plugins/"&gt;o pluginech&lt;/a&gt; a procházel &lt;a href="https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/wiki/MkDocs-Plugins"&gt;jejich nekonečný seznam&lt;/a&gt;. Vypadá to, že abych udělal to, co potřebuji, nebudu muset ani nic moc programovat. Stačilo by použít &lt;a href="https://github.com/andyoakley/mkdocs-jinja2"&gt;mkdocs-jinja2&lt;/a&gt; nebo &lt;a href="https://github.com/fralau/mkdocs_macros_plugin"&gt;mkdocs_macros_plugin&lt;/a&gt;. U toho prvního si nejsem jistý, jak moc je to aktivní, tak jsem tam cvičně poslal Pull Request a založil issue :D Na JG jsem si udělal větev, ve které jsem experimentálně rozjel MkDocs a sloučil se zbytkem webu tak, abych případně mohl novou verzi příručky vytvářet jako &lt;em&gt;continuous deployment&lt;/em&gt; aspoň někde za lomítkem (třeba junior.guru/handbook/).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pročetl jsem si v klubu všechny příspěvky, kterými se nově příchozí představili. V souvislosti s tím mě napadla celá řada témat, které bych chtěl s lidmi v klubu probrat. Pár jsem jich už sem tam vytáhl.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Připadal jsem si &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dzello/status/1361422560617922560"&gt;takhle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Členka klubu &lt;a href="https://martinahytychova.github.io/"&gt;Martina Hytychová&lt;/a&gt; napsala článek o tom, jak v &lt;a href="https://cesko.digital/"&gt;Česko.Digital&lt;/a&gt; začala dobrovolničením sbírat praxi jako junior programátorka. Boží! Pracuji na tom, aby to mohlo vyjít na blogu Česko.Digital, případně jinde.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Petr Viktorin &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so10Ud-YlKE"&gt;rozjíždí online kurz Pythonu pro začátečníky&lt;/a&gt;. Propagoval jsem kurz na několika místech.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na JG se objevilo pár nových nabídek práce, takže jsem se postaral o jejich uveřejnění na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/"&gt;stránce s inzeráty&lt;/a&gt; a fakturoval jsem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Koukal jsem se na &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1272744281531285504?s=21"&gt;MyST&lt;/a&gt;, hybrid Markdownu a reStructuredText.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poslouchal jsem &lt;a href="http://radio.garden/visit/selfoss/Do0QYeu3"&gt;jedno rádio na Islandu&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="http://radio.garden/listen/nehanda-radio/4tvUaI27"&gt;jedno v Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vedl jsem jednání s třemi firmami o jejich spolupráci s JG.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Šel jsem na procházku s jedním velkým šéfem jednoho velkého českého startupu. Stále platí, že do června nehledám novou práci a počítám s tím, že se mi povede do té doby klub rozjet, ale je dobré nenechat si zrezavět zadní vrátka.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přeorganizoval jsem kanály v klubu na Discordu, aby (snad) lépe odrážely způsob, jakým lidé v klubu diskutují.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Naprogramoval jsem integraci pracovních nabídek z portálu &lt;a href="https://dobrysef.cz/"&gt;Dobrý Šéf&lt;/a&gt;. Sami za mnou přišli a nabídli, že můžeme nabídky propojit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Snažil jsem se naprogramovat integraci &lt;a href="https://wiki.cesko.digital/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1573299#Kohote%C4%8Fhled%C3%A1me-%F0%9F%91%A9%F0%9F%8F%BB%E2%80%8D%F0%9F%92%BBV%C3%BDvoj"&gt;pracovních nabídek z Česko.Digital&lt;/a&gt;, ale zatím se to nepovedlo dokončit. Je potřeba přeorganizovat data v Airtable (poprosil jsem) a pak &lt;a href="https://github.com/cesko-digital/cd-tools/pull/3"&gt;dokončit Pull Request&lt;/a&gt;. Byť jsem se u toho dost rozčiloval (kvůli Airtable) a vůbec neuměl TypeScript, všichni na mě byli moc milí a se vším mi pomáhali.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neuváženě jsem po dlouhé době upgradoval vše, co mám nainstalované přes Homebrew. Potom jsem hodinu nebo dvě řešil, proč mi přestalo vše na JG fungovat a dokola jsem přeinstalovával náhodné npm závislosti.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firmy, které mají logo na příručce, dostávají e-mailem pravidelné souhrny se statistikami. Doplnil jsem možnost zaznačit si, že firma souhrny dostávat nechce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="co-planuji"&gt;Co plánuji&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#co-planuji" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tři věci, které bych chtěl zvládnout udělat příště:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html"&gt;PANIC MONSTER&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Napsat konečně článek pro &lt;a href="https://karierko.cz/"&gt;Kariérko.cz&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html"&gt;PANIC MONSTER&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přidat co nejzajímavější nový obsah do příručky a propagovat to, tím dostat přes nové menu další členy do klubu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Komunikovat s firmami. Připomenout se těm, se kterými jsem si psal dřív a nemám odezvu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonusy: Dále bych měl přemýšlet nad tím, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1362712162062524418"&gt;jak překopu homepage&lt;/a&gt; a jak překlopím příručku nebo celý web do MkDocs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-co-vy"&gt;A co vy?&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#a-co-vy" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud byste čistě náhodou měli dojem, že jste oproti mě za uplynulý týden vůbec nic nestihli, tak mám pro vás skvělou zprávu! V klidu se na ten dojem &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/neni-to-zavod/"&gt;můžete vykašlat&lt;/a&gt;. Není zač!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="co-me-zaujalo"&gt;Co mě zaujalo&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#co-me-zaujalo" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když si něco přečtu nebo poslechnu a líbí se mi to, &lt;a href="https://getpocket.com/@honzajavorek"&gt;sdílím to na Pocketu&lt;/a&gt;. Od posledních poznámek jsem sdílel toto:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="klub"&gt;Klub&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#klub" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V průběhu tohoto týdne jsem se dále věnoval &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/club/"&gt;klubu&lt;/a&gt;. Každý den sleduji, co se tam děje a dělám si poznámky z toho, co se tam řeší, abych měl inspiraci na nové kapitoly do příručky. Zároveň na vše odepisuji, když tedy mám co odepsat. V klubu už je zhruba 100 lidí, žije to tam diskuzemi o materiálech, kurzech, motivaci, projektech, pohovorech. Radíme si o všem možném.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="vylepseni-avataru-na-strance-klubu"&gt;Vylepšení avatarů na stránce klubu&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#vylepseni-avataru-na-strance-klubu" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avatary členů na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/club/"&gt;stránce klubu&lt;/a&gt; jsem měl hotové už minulý týden, ale měl jsem tam chybu v číslu, což poškozovalo marketingové sdělení. Tu jsem opravil, použil jsem &lt;a href="https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#discord.Guild.fetch_members"&gt;fetch_members&lt;/a&gt;. Avatarům jsem přidal &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; a &lt;code&gt;height&lt;/code&gt;. Načítaly se přímo ze serverů Discordu, což jsem nechtěl, takže jsem trochu přebudoval backend a obrázky postahoval přes možnosti objektu &lt;a href="https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#discord.Asset.save"&gt;Asset&lt;/a&gt;. Byly ve formátu WebP, což tedy má prý už dnes každý používat místo PNG, ale já jsem pozadu a konzerva, takže jsem zatím WebP neřešil (i když &lt;a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-webp"&gt;gulp-webp&lt;/a&gt; jsem teda našel a asi by nebylo to těžké přidat a všechny obrázky co mám převést). Stažené avatary jsem naládoval přímo do &lt;a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/handbook/image-file-formats.html#webp"&gt;Pillow, které WebP umí&lt;/a&gt;, konvertoval do PNG, zmenšil, uložil. Paráda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rozcestnik-pro-cleny"&gt;Rozcestník pro členy&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#rozcestnik-pro-cleny" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zjistil jsem podle zpětné vazby, že registrace do klubu není pro mnoho lidí zrovna bezproblémová. Vytvořil jsem tedy novou stránku, &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/membership/"&gt;rozcestník pro členy&lt;/a&gt;, kde jsou všechny důležité odkazy a i nějaké praktické tipy. Na tuto novou stránku jsou lidi přesměrováni hned po registraci, ale mohou se na ni prokliknout i ze &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/club/"&gt;stránky klubu&lt;/a&gt; přes odkaz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adresa je &lt;code&gt;/membership/&lt;/code&gt;, ale po registraci přesměrovávám na &lt;code&gt;/membership/?state=success&lt;/code&gt;. JG jsou statické stránky, ale toto mi umožňuje, abych se v JavaScriptu podíval do parametrů v URL a když tam najdu &lt;code&gt;state=success&lt;/code&gt;, odkryju přes &lt;code&gt;display: block;&lt;/code&gt; ještě jedno jinak skryté upozornění navíc. Klidně si to &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/membership/?state=success"&gt;zkuste&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vyjel jsem si z Memberful seznam lidí, kteří mají členství, ale neprošli až do Discordu. Poslal jsem jim jednorázově ručně e-mail, kde jsem je na nový rozcestník upozornil a poprosil je, aby mě kontaktovali, pokud se nemohou do chatu dostat. Samozřejmě je možné, že mě chce někdo jen podpořit a do chatu vůbec nechce. To se uvidí, až vyprší těch prvních 14 dní zdarma :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="prvni-sraz"&gt;První sraz&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#prvni-sraz" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chtěl jsem uspořádat nějaký první živý online sraz, abychom se trochu lépe poznali. V pondělí jsem vytvořil &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/171BZ-JcoRMdZxaL4F7VSUOMIdC3q4iCzp61zgnQ_vB8/edit?usp=sharing"&gt;Google dokument s informacemi&lt;/a&gt; a dal v klubu hlasovat o tom, který den to chceme udělat. Z hlasování vyšel čtvrtek, takže se to odehrálo včera. Měl jsem &lt;em&gt;lightning talk&lt;/em&gt; o tom, jak chápat a používat GitHub profil. Myslím, že to bylo fajn a vypadá to, že si to myslí i účastníci.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Řešili jsme nějaké technické potíže s Fedorou (nebo možná spíš Firefoxem) a s otravnými zvuky, ale vše jsme během dneška vyřešili, takže se to příště už nebude opakovat. &lt;em&gt;Lightning talky&lt;/em&gt; jsme z různých důvodů nestihli do pěti minut a volnou debatu se nám nedařilo úplně moderovat tak, aby nemluvili stále stejní lidé. Prošli jsme si tedy stejným problémem, jaký bývá i na jiných online srazech, když se pokouší o volnou debatu. Podle všeho ale tento problém vadí hlavně mě a dvěma dalším lidem, ostatní si to zřejmě užili i přesto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chtěl bych, abychom aspirovali na nějaké řešení toho problému. Jeden člověk tvrdí, že moderování nepomůže a řešit by to snad mohlo jít jen jinou technologií pro sraz (např. &lt;a href="https://gather.town/"&gt;gather.town&lt;/a&gt;). Druhý člověk tvrdí, že bychom moderování měli dát ještě šanci, ale opravdu se tomu věnovat a aktivně zkoušet všechny moderovací techniky. Nevím, kdy bude další sraz, takže mám čas si to nechat projít hlavou, ale pokud máte nějakou zkušenost s nějakou z následujících technologií, budu rád, pokud se podělíte o dojmy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://gather.town/"&gt;gather.town&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://reslash.co/"&gt;reslash.co&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;něco ze seznamu &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25041946"&gt;tady na HN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;něco ze seznamu &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R5DXWtz4H7eIT5VbGYJEdY0fHasekDxL_x-FN84ItvE/edit#gid=0"&gt;tady na Google docs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sraz probíhal od 18:30 zhruba do 22:30, za mě dobrý :) Uvažuji, že příště dotáhnu nějaké speakery s přednáškami, ale uvidím. Vlastně ještě nevím, jaký formát tomu chci dávat. Osobně by mi vyhovovalo, kdyby to nebyly nějaké velké pravidelné srazy, ale spíše častější setkání pro ty, kteří půjdou zrovna kolem, tu pokec, tu přednáška. Nechci konkurovat srazům jako Frontendisti nebo Pyvo, chtěl bych ty akce mít spíš nahodilejší, odlehčenější, pro utužení komunity uvnitř klubu. Vůbec by mi nevadilo, kdyby si nějaké srazíky časem uspořádali i samotní členové, klidně i bez mé účasti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="prebudovani-webu-jg"&gt;Přebudování webu JG&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#prebudovani-webu-jg" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chystám se přebudovávat web JG tak, aby nově odrážel to, že klub je hlavní aktivita. Také chci, aby byla příručka snadno spravovatelná, lehce se do ní přidávalo, případně aby se do ní lidi nebáli poslat Pull Request. Jistě bych to mohl nějak splácat v tom, co mám, ale na to nějak nemám chuť. S &lt;em&gt;pivotem&lt;/em&gt; na klub mám vnitřní pocit, že stavět nad tím, co mám, by vyústilo v hrozný nepořádek a také by mě to nebavilo. Nevím, co z toho je horší. Takže uvažuji, jestli neudělat zásadní změny v architektuře webu, designu, atd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mou hlavní úlohou je teď věnovat se klubu a propagovat ho, získat pro něj aspoň 300 platících lidí. Zároveň ale nemám jinou naléhavou činnost, u které bych mohl "odpočívat" od komunikace a něco vyrábět. Myslím, že i kdyby se nepovedlo klub rozjet, bylo by dobré JG přebudovat tak, aby nebylo tolik závislé na mně a dalo se třeba do budoucna udržovat např. na dobrovolnické bázi. Tento týden jsem se tedy dost věnoval přemýšlení a vzdělávání:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Koukal jsem na &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MaHeNOUv2Q"&gt;Frontendisty o TypeScriptu&lt;/a&gt;. Vlastně ani nevím proč, TS mě nezajímá. Asi jsem chtěl jen vidět Aleše, jak všechny vyhejtí :D a co doporučí místo TS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vyplnil jsem Frontendistům &lt;a href="https://frontendisti.cz/dotaznik"&gt;dotazník&lt;/a&gt; a pak jsem si trochu prošel různé technologie, které zmiňoval, jako Snowpack, esbuild, PostCSS, PureCSS, Semantic UI. Nejvíce mě pro mé využití zaujal esbuild. U toho PostCSS jsem si nějak nebyl jistý, jestli to není něco, co mělo dřív význam, ale dnes už by mohlo být za zenitem, protože prefixů netřeba. Nicméně nedokážu asi fundovaně posoudit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pustil jsem si pár videí na &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCfqyGl3nq_V0bo64CjZh8g"&gt;YT kanálu CD, který jsem si nedávno oblíbil&lt;/a&gt;. Nadšeně jsem o nich vyprávěl pár přátelům a ti se zakoukali do dalších videí a pak mi je posílali a vedli jsme o nich kratší nebo i dlouhé debaty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/frontendisti/permalink/2750538771824296/"&gt;Zeptal jsem se&lt;/a&gt;, kde by se dal sehnat podklad pro CSS, který by byl trochu jako Tailwind, ale vlastně neměl s Tailwindem nic společného.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na základě odpovědí na dotaz jsem &lt;a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/"&gt;pročítal velkou část dokumentace nejnovějšího Bootstrapu&lt;/a&gt; a zkusil vytvořit malinký prototyp, který by podklad z Bootstrapu používal. Zajímavá cesta.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zamyslel jsem se zase nad tím, že příručka je ve své podstatě dokumentace a nebylo by od věci na ni použít nějaký dokumentační &lt;em&gt;engine&lt;/em&gt;, jako třeba Sphinx. Jenže to už jsem trochu zkoušel a nikam to nevedlo. Taky mě štve, že teď JG používá Flask a Frozen-Flask, ale je to vlastně &lt;em&gt;overkill&lt;/em&gt; a už jen přegenerovat HTML vždy hrozně trvá. JG je ve své podstatě SQLite databáze, ze které se generují statické HTML stránky přes Jinja2. Flask mi pomáhá s pár detaily (třeba generování stránek s dynamickým URL, jako jsou nabídky práce, nebo provázání stránek přes &lt;code&gt;url_for()&lt;/code&gt; apod.), ale jinak je tam vlastně zbytečně. Říkal jsem si, jestli v dnešní době není něco lepšího, co by mi řešilo většinu věcí a zbytek bych jen přiohnul. Mrkl jsem na &lt;a href="https://jamstack.org/generators/"&gt;staticgen.com&lt;/a&gt;, vyfiltroval na Python a Jinja2, procházel co najdu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jsem velkým fanouškem Sphinxu, ale jeho síla i velká nevýhoda je to, že stojí nad docutils. Ty jsou totiž abstraktní "DOM" dokumentu, jenž Sphinxu umožňuje pracovat s různými formáty a generovat různé výstupy (HTML, PDF...). Jenže tato abstrakce strašně zesložiťuje psaní nějakých rozšíření. Navíc docutils mají naprosto mizernou dokumentaci. Na tomto se prostě vždy zaseknu. Třeba v sekci &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/learn/#learn"&gt;Jak začít&lt;/a&gt; mám obrázkový seznam a takových mám na JG hodně. V reStructuredText ani Markdownu je neudělám. Mohl bych si na to napsat rozšíření, ale ve Sphinxu to prostě nedám, je to strašné. A tak jsem začal koukat po &lt;a href="https://www.mkdocs.org/"&gt;MkDocs&lt;/a&gt;. Asi netušíte, jak se při tom cítím, prostě úplná hereze, ale dávám tomu šanci. Ještě větší hereze by byla klesnout k MDX a nějakým těm Gatsby/Next.js věcem, ale to mi asi fakt nehrozí, to bych se musel zbláznit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chvíli jsem uvažoval, jestli mít Markdown v HTML (případně v Jinja2), jako to dělá třeba tady &lt;a href="https://flask-markdown.readthedocs.io/"&gt;nějaké rozšíření pro Flask&lt;/a&gt; pomocí &lt;code&gt;{% filter markdown %}...{% endfilter %}&lt;/code&gt;, nebo jestli mám mít občasné HTML v Markdownu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pročetl jsem velkou část dokumentace MkDocs. MkDocs dnes vypadají kupodivu docela rozšiřitelně. Mám pocit, že když jsem se díval posledně, pluginy tam ještě nebyly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Koukal jsem, &lt;a href="https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues/2276"&gt;jak lze v MkDocs použít třeba SCSS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pročetl jsem velkou část dokumentace &lt;a href="https://python-markdown.github.io/"&gt;Markdown knihovny pro Python&lt;/a&gt;. Zkoumal jsem, jak se v Pythonu píšou rozšíření pro Markdown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Díval jsem se na &lt;a href="https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/attr_list/"&gt;attr_list&lt;/a&gt;, který umožňuje vkládat CSS třídy přímo do markupu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Procházel jsem si &lt;a href="https://github.com/Python-Markdown/markdown/wiki/Third-Party-Extensions"&gt;seznam rozšíření&lt;/a&gt;, abych si je proklikal a podíval se, jak jsou vyrobené. Překvapilo mě, že jedno z nich mířilo na &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/markdown-del-ins"&gt;můj repozitář&lt;/a&gt;. Pak jsem si vzpomněl, že vlastně jedno rozšíření opravdu spravuji. Jsem jeho maintainer, spravuji jeho balíček na PyPi. Dokonce jsem o tom myslím dřív psal tady v poznámkách. No, stane se, člověk zapomene :D&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přemýšlel jsem i o něčem jako &lt;a href="https://mdxjs.com/"&gt;MDX&lt;/a&gt; a koukal jsem se, v jakém stavu jsou &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components"&gt;Web Components&lt;/a&gt; a jestli existuje něco, co pracuje s nimi. A našel jsem &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1360225550644740096"&gt;MDJS&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zatím se mi rýsuje něco jako:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zkusit udělat většinu webu nad MkDocs. Pokud mi nebude dostačovat běžný Markdown, zkusit si jej rozšířit. Uvažuji o něčem jako o možnosti napsat si v Jinja2 "komponentu" a tu potom moci "použít" v Markdownu, zavolat ji akorát s nějakými daty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSS založit na podkladu z Bootstrapu, ale psát si nad tím komponenty v SCSS sám ručně pomocí BEMu jako doteď.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pokud JavaScript, tak vanilla ES2017 a pokud by ho bylo potřeba více, tak &lt;a href="https://hotwire.dev/"&gt;Hotwire&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zatím jsem ale moc nepřišel na to, jak takové přebudování udělat jako &lt;em&gt;continuous delivery&lt;/em&gt; a nezbláznit se z toho. Jinak to ovšem dělat nechci, takže není cesta začít to šudlat někde bokem, jediná cesta je nějak to prostě vymyslet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;O víkendu jsem napsal &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/how-to-create-non-interactive-discord-bot"&gt;článek o tom, jak napsat neinteraktivního Discord bota&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hned z kraje týdne se &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1358749770886619140"&gt;rozbilo&lt;/a&gt; napojení na API &lt;a href="https://remoteok.io/"&gt;remoteok.io&lt;/a&gt;. Opravil jsem to tak, aby se má strana s chybou vyrovnala a prostě v takovém případě vyhodila nula nabídek. Teď koukám, že už to opravili.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odstranil jsem Stripe z dependencies JG, protože jej nakonec nevyuživám napřímo, ale přes Memberful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vymysleli jsme v klubu jiný název pro hlavní hlasový kanál, aby se nepřekrýval s hlavním textovým a lidé se omylem nepřeklikávali.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Koukal jsem na kousek &lt;a href="https://www.campuj.online/"&gt;debaty o NNŽ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Připomenul jsem se jednomu vydavatelství s tím, že bychom mohli domluvit slevu na knihy pro klub. Zatím bez odpovědi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Připomenul jsem se někomu, kdo mi má poslat fakturu. Poslední dobou mi nějak neodepisují lidé ani firmy, až mám skoro obavu, jestli mi funguje e-mail. Ale asi mi prostě akorát neodepisují :-/ Že mi ale člověk nepošle fakturu když mu mám zaplatit peníze? :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domluvil jsem se na příští týden na venkovní kafe s jedním velkým šéfem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Naceňoval jsem nabídku pro jednu firmu. Dělal jsem to vždy večer a nasekal jsem v tom postupně různé chyby a pak jsem se omlouval. Poučení: Když už mi nejde ta matika, tak bych ji aspoň měl dělat ráno, nebo nevím. Dopadlo to dobře, faktura odeslána, roční členství v klubu a logo na příručce bude!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Koukal jsem na &lt;a href="https://andrewsvk.github.io/piano/"&gt;piano&lt;/a&gt;, které vytvořil jeden člen klubu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Koupil jsem si běhací ledvinku na mobil, ale ještě jsem v ní nebyl. Při posledním běhu jsem uklouzl na bahně a spadl do šípkového keře, takže tento týden jsem nechával odpočinout kotník.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zjistil jsem, že na světě existují dvě ikony pro sdílení a podle toho, jestli používáte Google nebo Apple jste velmi pravděpodobně zvyklí jen na jednu z nich a automaticky jí rozumíte, ale té druhé ne. Anketa &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1360223114714611713"&gt;zde&lt;/a&gt;. Někdo mi řekl "dej tam ikonu na sdílení, takové ty tři tečky spojené čárama, tomu rozumí každý". Vůbec jsem netušil, o čem je řeč!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="co-planuji"&gt;Co plánuji&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#co-planuji" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tři věci, které bych chtěl zvládnout udělat příště:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html"&gt;PANIC MONSTER&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Napsat konečně článek pro &lt;a href="https://karierko.cz/"&gt;Kariérko.cz&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html"&gt;PANIC MONSTER&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Začít předělávat web junior.guru tak, aby klub byl v centru dění.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Napojit nabídky práce z &lt;a href="https://dobrysef.cz/"&gt;Dobrého šéfa&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-co-vy"&gt;A co vy?&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#a-co-vy" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud byste čistě náhodou měli dojem, že jste oproti mě za uplynulý týden vůbec nic nestihli, tak mám pro vás skvělou zprávu! V klidu se na ten dojem &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/neni-to-zavod/"&gt;můžete vykašlat&lt;/a&gt;. Není zač!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Když si něco přečtu nebo poslechnu a líbí se mi to, &lt;a href="https://getpocket.com/@honzajavorek"&gt;sdílím to na Pocketu&lt;/a&gt;. Od posledních poznámek jsem sdílel toto:&lt;/p&gt;

To be able to do some record keeping, or create a dynamic showcase of current members on the club page, I wanted to create a script, which would connect to Discord's API on a daily basis, download some data, then terminate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as I learned, people usually strive for interactive bots with continual runtime, so all the tooling and tutorials describe that use case. After figuring it all out pretty much myself, here I present a missing tutorial for building a non-interactive bot, a one-time script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll be using Python and the &lt;a href="https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/"&gt;discord.py&lt;/a&gt; library. There are myriads of tutorials on how to start and set up a Discord bot in Python, so I won't be covering that. Be guided by the &lt;a href="https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#getting-started"&gt;Getting started&lt;/a&gt; section of the discord.py docs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll add only one pro tip, which I don't think the docs cover very well. To be able to interact with the Discord API, you'll need to reference your server (in the API terminology it's &lt;em&gt;guild&lt;/em&gt;), your channels, users, etc. using IDs, but it's not very clear where those IDs come from. The trick is that you need to &lt;a href="https://www.swipetips.com/how-to-get-channel-id-in-discord/"&gt;switch your Discord app to dev mode&lt;/a&gt; and then you can get the IDs using the context menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let's say you went through the intro, finished it with the following code, and it works for you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;discord&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;discord&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;on_ready&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'We have logged in as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{0.user}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;on_message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;author&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;startswith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'$hello'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;channel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;send&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Hello!'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'... token ...'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, this is an interactive bot, which prints out a message when it starts, then runs indefinitely and listens to messages, reacting to greetings. Under the hood, the code uses &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html"&gt;asyncio&lt;/a&gt; to communicate with the API, and as soon as the &lt;code&gt;client.run()&lt;/code&gt; happens, it runs in an asyncio loop forever. That's kind of cool, but we won't need any of that. We want to spin up the loop, do whatever we need, then immediately stop the loop and terminate the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="creating-a-one-time-script"&gt;Creating a one-time script&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#creating-a-one-time-script" title="Permanent link to this heading"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;discord&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;NonInteractiveClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;discord&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;on_ready&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;wait_until_ready&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'We have logged in as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{0.user}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;NonInteractiveClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'... token ...'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code above is very different, but part of it is because it takes a different approach to using the client. The previous program instantiated the client class and then used the &lt;code&gt;@client.event&lt;/code&gt; decorators to register listeners to various events. This code inherits from the client class, implements the listeners as methods, and then runs this custom client's loop. I suspect these approaches are equivalent, but when I searched for solutions and asked around, this inheritance-based approach was what I got, so this is what I'm using in my solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When &lt;code&gt;client.run()&lt;/code&gt; executes, it spins up an endless loop. The &lt;em&gt;ready&lt;/em&gt; event fires, which triggers the &lt;code&gt;on_ready()&lt;/code&gt; method. In it, we use &lt;code&gt;self.wait_until_ready()&lt;/code&gt; until everything is in place. Now we can do our non-interactive work, which is represented by the &lt;code&gt;print()&lt;/code&gt; call in the example. When we're done, we explicitly close the client, which also stops the loop and lets the program to end, instead of hanging forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="adding-error-handling"&gt;Adding error handling&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#adding-error-handling" title="Permanent link to this heading"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would be all great, but there's one problem. When error happens, it prints out, but the program hangs. Even if you do some changes to the code and force the program to end on error, it's hard to ensure it has a correct exit code. Exit code of a program should be 0 if all went nice and smooth, but it should be 1 (more precisely, non-zero) in case of a problem. If we run the script as part of a CI job (CircleCI, GitHub Actions…) and it fails, returning a non-zero code ensures the whole job fails. So how do we do this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue is multi-level. First, the discord.py library eats the errors. Second, the asyncio loop eats the errors. If there's an exception raised, it won't crash the program. It gets eaten by one of the error handlers, printed, but silenced. This is a desired behavior in case of a long-running process, where the program is expected to log errors for later inspection, but ideally recovers and continues to do its job. In a one-time script, we want exactly the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;discord&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;NonInteractiveClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;discord&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;on_ready&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;wait_until_ready&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'We have logged in as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{0.user}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;on_error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;kwargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;NonInteractiveClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'... token ...'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the example above, we added an &lt;code&gt;on_error()&lt;/code&gt; listener method, which by default eats errors, but we implemented it in a way that it re-raises them. This way we can work around the discord.py behavior, but it isn't enough for the program to crash on error, because the asyncio loop will still eat it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="working-around-asyncio"&gt;Working around asyncio&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#working-around-asyncio" title="Permanent link to this heading"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, &lt;code&gt;client.loop&lt;/code&gt; allows us to access the loop object and we can modify the behavior. It's not gonna be very nice, but it's gonna work and that surely counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;discord&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;NonInteractiveClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;discord&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;on_ready&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'We have logged in as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{0.user}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the &lt;code&gt;client.loop.set_exception_handler()&lt;/code&gt; allows us to specify our own error handler. I've found it &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.loop.set_exception_handler"&gt;deep in the Python docs&lt;/a&gt;. It expects a &lt;em&gt;handler&lt;/em&gt;. That's a fancy name for a function, which would be called in case an error occurs. In such case, it will be given the &lt;em&gt;loop&lt;/em&gt; object as the first argument and something mysterious called &lt;em&gt;context&lt;/em&gt; as the second. The docs say this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;context&lt;/em&gt; is a &lt;code&gt;dict&lt;/code&gt; object containing the details of the exception (see &lt;code&gt;call_exception_handler()&lt;/code&gt; documentation for details about context).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Down the rabbit hole, &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.loop.call_exception_handler"&gt;the linked docs&lt;/a&gt; explain all the contents of the dictionary. We see that the actual exception can be found under the &lt;code&gt;exception&lt;/code&gt; key. So in the example code above, we add a custom error handler, &lt;code&gt;exc_handler()&lt;/code&gt;, and pass it to the &lt;code&gt;client.loop.set_exception_handler()&lt;/code&gt;. In this custom handler we get the exception object from the context, save it to a global variable &lt;code&gt;exc&lt;/code&gt; (actually &lt;em&gt;nonlocal&lt;/em&gt; variable, but in this case it doesn't matter), then call whatever default exception handler the loop has, and stop the loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now, when error occurs, we re-raise it in the &lt;code&gt;on_error()&lt;/code&gt; listener (discord.py level), and our custom &lt;code&gt;exc_handler()&lt;/code&gt; gets called (asyncio loop level), which saves the exception object for later and stops the loop. At that moment, &lt;code&gt;client.run()&lt;/code&gt; stops blocking the program and the lines after it can be executed. In a simple &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement we can peek if an error happened. If yes, we can finally raise it like normal synchronous Python beings, without any loop magic interfering anymore. This crashes the program and sets the exit code to 1. If there is no error (the &lt;code&gt;client.run()&lt;/code&gt; has been stopped by &lt;code&gt;self.close()&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;on_ready()&lt;/code&gt;), the program ends normally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="full-program"&gt;Full program&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#full-program" title="Permanent link to this heading"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The example below adds a separate function for the actual code of the one-time script. It loads members of a specific Discord server, aka &lt;em&gt;guild&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pprint.html"&gt;pretty prints&lt;/a&gt; them one by one. The ugly rest is the infrastructure needed to work around all the built-in loop architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;discord&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;pprint&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pprint&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Actual code of the one-time script, which does something useful&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;guild&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get_guild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;123445.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;member&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;guild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;members&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;pprint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;member&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# The ugly rest&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;NonInteractiveClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;discord&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;on_ready&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;wait_until_ready&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;on_error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;kwargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;exc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This all took me a while to figure out. It's not very beautiful, but it seems to work as I need. If anyone knows of a better, shorter, nicer code, which achieves the same, I'd be happy if you share it with me in the comments.

&lt;p&gt;Tento týden jsem si převážně chatoval s lidmi v klubu, psal e-maily a posílal faktury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="spusteni-klubu"&gt;Spuštení klubu&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#spusteni-klubu" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V pondělí se mi konečně podařilo spustit &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/spoustim-klub/"&gt;klub&lt;/a&gt;. Právnička mi poslala poslední verzi obchodních podmínek a textu o ochraně osobních údajů. Zřejmě na tom pracovala o víkendu. Půl dne jsem texty přepisoval na web do HTML, upravil ještě nějaká přesměrování a nastavení v Google Analytics a zhruba ve tři odpoledne jsem klub potichu spustil. Až jsem na prvních jednotkách lidí otestoval, že vše funguje, odvážil jsem se o spuštění napsat na internety. Udělal jsem lednový newsletter (1.2., ehm) a do něj dal informaci, že klub je spuštěný. Během úterý jsem to pak propagoval i na zbytku internetu. Většinu týdne jsem pak strávil v klubu, abych rozdmýchával a nasměrovával vznikající společenství. Objevilo se hned několik ohlasů, hezky si je tady poznamenám:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V době psaní tohoto článku je v klubu 87 členů. Na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/club/"&gt;stránce klubu&lt;/a&gt; je teď špatné číslo, mám tam chybu. Je už ale pátek večer, tak opravím po víkendu. Zhruba 30 lidí bylo v klubu ještě před oficiálním spuštěním, takže za první týden jich přibylo skoro 60 nových. Nejsou to všechno placení členové, protože jsem s členstvím zdarma obeslal podporovatele z Patreonu i GitHubu. Také z toho zatím nelze jednoduše vypočítat příjmy, jelikož všichni mají prvních 14 dní v klubu zdarma a ve skutečnosti tedy ještě neplatil nikdo nic. Tedy vyjma členů, kteří šli přes firemní členství a poslal jsem jim fakturu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Během týdne jsem kontaktoval firmy, které samy projevily zájem o členství v klubu, nebo u nichž brzy vyprší sponzorství loga na příručce. Mám díky tomu rozjednaných hned několik firemních členství. S &lt;a href="https://creatiweb.cz/"&gt;Creatiweb&lt;/a&gt; jsme to vyřešili rychle, takže jejich logo už visí na webu. Pokud máte jako firma zájem o členství v klubu, pište na &lt;a href="mailto:ahoj@junior.guru"&gt;ahoj@junior.guru&lt;/a&gt;, díky!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poznámka:&lt;/strong&gt; Pokud mě podporuješ na Patreonu nebo GitHubu a nemáš ode mě za poslední týden žádnou zprávu, ozvi se mi prosím. Posílal jsem všem svým podporovatelům vstup do klubu, ale mnohým to nedošlo, protože mají vypnuté zasílání e-mailů nebo jim to spadlo do spamu. Nemám bohužel na některé podporovatele jiný kontakt a také nevím, komu přesně to nepřišlo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="prvni-dojmy-z-klubu"&gt;První dojmy z klubu&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#prvni-dojmy-z-klubu" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;První dojmy jsou fajn! Bál jsem se, že lidi se přihlásí, ale nebudou diskutovat, že to budu muset hodně rozdmýchávat. Není to tak. Hned se chytili různých témat a prakticky od úterý klub kontinuálně žije. Nestíhám si ani psát poznámky, některá témata, co se řešila, budu určitě zpracovávat do příručky. Hromada inspirace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taky mám zatím velmi dobrý pocit z toho, jací lidi se do klubu přidali. Je to zajímavá směs juniorů i seniorů, řeší se všechno možné, od technologií po kariérní otázky. Velmi se mi líbí, jak se členové motivují a podporují např. před tím, než jde někdo na pohovor. Nebo jak řeší zkušenosti z různých kurzů. Zatím jsou k sobě všichni vesměs milí. Tak jsem si to přesně představoval. Způsob komunikace mi hodně připomíná upřímností a neformálností &lt;a href="https://pyvo.cz/"&gt;Python srazy&lt;/a&gt; nebo trochu ten &lt;a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/"&gt;Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt; (do kterého jsem už na celou jednu hodinu nakoukl!) akorát to probíhá psanou formou. Zatím to neumím pojmenovat, ale tak nějak obrazně pokyvuji hlavou a říkám si, že něco takového mi prostě fakt chybělo, zvlášť teď v tom covidovém blázinci.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Některé technikálie se časem budou muset dořešit. Například rozložení kanálů (nově česky &lt;em&gt;růmek&lt;/em&gt;, ehm), které zatím nejvíc připomíná architektem navržený park, kde lidi chodí přes trávu, protože to dává větší smysl, než vymyšlené chodníčky. Uvažujeme o nějakých rolích podle oblastí zájmu. Založili jsme kanál #til (podle zkratky pro &lt;em&gt;today I learned&lt;/em&gt;), kam píšeme, co jsme se každý dnes naučili a je to poučné a zajímavé zároveň.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Příští týden bych chtěl udělat nějaký první "sraz" na hlasovém kanálu. Trochu se peru s nesmělostí a taky nevím tak úplně jak na to, určitě to bude potřeba nějak moderovat, ale musím to udělat, protože to lidi ještě víc stmelí a podle mě to bude super. Už se těším na tu energii, která z toho bude. A domlouvám už i nějaké přednášky pro členy klubu, kamarádi se mi už sami přihlásili se spoustou témat! Ajaj, tolik práce mě čeká :) Starat se o klub bude rozhodně fuška, ale mám pocit, že to dává perfektní smysl a že mě to bude bavit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A ještě jeden postřeh. Myslím, že &lt;a href="https://memberful.com/"&gt;Memberful&lt;/a&gt; funguje na jedničku a že bez něj bych se asi po… :) Jsem rád, že jsem si to nevyráběl sám. A zatím to vypadá, že funguje i řešení firemního předplatného pomocí kupónů, jak jsem jej tady popisoval před dvěma týdny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zly-robot"&gt;Zlý robot&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#zly-robot" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Společně se spuštěním se mi v Google Analytics objevil nějaký robot, který je kompletně zaspamoval. Nějaký bottrafic.live. &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/thread/96082408?hl=en"&gt;Nebyl jsem v tom sám&lt;/a&gt;, ale nepovedlo se mi to ani podle návodů odfiltrovat, tak jsem prostě přestal do GA koukat. Je tam velký, nepěkný zub. Blbé je, že mi to pokazí i statistiku na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/hire-juniors/"&gt;stránce pro firmy&lt;/a&gt;, ale nebylo to naštěstí zas &lt;em&gt;tak moc&lt;/em&gt; návštěv navíc (maximálně 1500, což je srovnatelné s tím, když někde o JG vyšel článek) a čísla na té stránce jsou zprůměrovaná za poslední měsíce, tak to asi nebudu nijak dál řešit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="banner"&gt;Banner&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#banner" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provozovatel &lt;a href="https://www.geobusiness.cz/"&gt;geobusiness.cz&lt;/a&gt; mi napsal, že by podpořil můj klub a že mu mám poslat banner, který by umístil na svůj web jako reklamu. Banner jsem tento týden vytvořil v Inkscape (a opět při tom použil &lt;a href="https://logo.junior.guru/"&gt;logo.junior.guru&lt;/a&gt;!). Pokud byste chtěli klub podobným způsobem podpořit, tak tady ten banner dávám k dispozici. Odkaz veďte prosím na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/club/"&gt;https://junior.guru/club/&lt;/a&gt;, díky!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="SVG varianta" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/juniorguru-klub-pridejse.svg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/club/"&gt;stránce klubu&lt;/a&gt; byly od začátku loga zúčastněných firem, ale chtěl jsem tam mít i nějakou motivační ukázku toho, kolik je v klubu jednotlivců. Využil jsem již dříve rozpracovaný skript, jímž jsem byl schopen vypsat seznam členů na Discordu. Tento seznam jsem teď vzal a uložil jsem si pro každého do databáze jeho ID a URL avataru. V aplikaci potom vytáhnu jen ty členy, kteří mají nastavený vlastní avatar, vyberu z nich náhodných 20 a ty zobrazím na stránce klubu. K tomu stačila už jen trocha (S)CSS. Avatary se překrývají díky zápornému marginu. Jelikož se stránka přegeneruje každý den, mělo by tam být každý den 20 jiných členů.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pak jsem ještě vzal počet členů v databázi, odečetl 20 a zobrazil na stránce za avatary text "+31 dalších", prohlásil pátek za ukončený a šel psát poznámky. Jenže při psaní poznámek a počítání členů pro úvodní odstavec jsem si hned všiml, že tam mám chybu. Discord v API stránkuje a já si kvůli tomu nejspíš nestahuji všechny členy. Číslo "+31 dalších" má být ve skutečnosti "+67 dalších". Rozhodl jsem se ale, že tohle opravím až v pondělí. Taky bych nechtěl obrázky odkazovat přímo, ale stáhnout je, zmenšit a zobrazovat z domény junior.guru, ale to taky dodělám později.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Opravil jsem na JG nějaké rozbité odkazy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během tohoto týdne přišly dvě nové &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/"&gt;nabídky práce&lt;/a&gt; na JG, takže jsem je zpracoval a poslal za ně dvě faktury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debugováním nepřicházejících pozvánek do klubu podporovatelům z GitHub Sponsors jsem strávil minimálně půlden.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Red Hat změnil způsob, jakým evidují dodavatele. Používají nyní systém &lt;a href="https://www.trustyoursupplier.com/"&gt;Trust Your Supplier&lt;/a&gt;, kam mi trvalo hodinu se zaregistrovat a pak na mě vyjelo 14 notifikací s různými dotazníky a dalšími věcmi, takže jsem se zasmál a tab v prohlížeči zavřel. Až to bude nutné, vyplním.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;S webem &lt;a href="https://dobrysef.cz/"&gt;dobrysef.cz&lt;/a&gt; jsme se domlouvali na exportu jejich pracovních nabídek, aby se mohly zobrazovat na JG.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tady na svém webu mám skript, který projde moje oblíbené RSS feedy a složí z nich jeden jediný, který pak láduju do Integromatu a ten mi nové věci láduje do Pocketu. V jednom z feedů se objevila chyba a ta mi několik dní shazovala pravidelný build webu. Jednak mi každý den přišla chyba do mailu, jednak mi nechodily nové články do Pocketu, takže jsem to musel opravit. Stačil jeden try/except.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="co-planuji"&gt;Co plánuji&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#co-planuji" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tři věci, které bych chtěl zvládnout udělat příště:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domluvit první virtuální sraz členů, první přednášky a slevu na knihy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vylepšit avatary na stránce klubu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Napsat konečně článek pro &lt;a href="https://karierko.cz/"&gt;Kariérko.cz&lt;/a&gt;, slibuji ho už dva měsíce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-co-vy"&gt;A co vy?&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#a-co-vy" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud byste čistě náhodou měli dojem, že jste oproti mě za uplynulý týden vůbec nic nestihli, tak mám pro vás skvělou zprávu! V klidu se na ten dojem &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/neni-to-zavod/"&gt;můžete vykašlat&lt;/a&gt;. Není zač!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Když si něco přečtu nebo poslechnu a líbí se mi to, &lt;a href="https://getpocket.com/@honzajavorek"&gt;sdílím to na Pocketu&lt;/a&gt;. Od posledních poznámek jsem sdílel toto:&lt;/p&gt;

Zajímavé jsou popisy toho, jak která firma začala a jaké jsou jejich synergie a plány. Taky se mi líbí, že “moderátor” je uživatelem Memberful, takže vede rozhovor z pozice “vy jste mi tady teď koupili něco co rád používám a teď se mi to tu obhajte a ubezpečte mě, že to nepůjde do kytek”, ptá se i na méně příjemné otázky. Kéž by každá akvizice měla takový rozhovor místo tiskových zpráv plných bullshitu.&lt;/li&gt;

Ve většině těch kurzů je blok, jak tvořit finanční rezervu, jak investovat třeba na burze a taky knížecí rady, že i z malého přijmu je možné ušetřit a dávat si něco stranou. V tom je vidět, jak lidem na okraji společnosti nerozumíme.”&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id="nastavovani-memberful"&gt;Nastavování Memberful&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#nastavovani-memberful" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jak jsem psal minule, pro správu členství v klubu jsem vybral jsem hotové řešení, &lt;a href="https://memberful.com/"&gt;Memberful&lt;/a&gt;. Tento týden jsem strávil dost času propojováním a nastavováním.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lokalizoval jsem všechny e-mailové šablony v Memberful. Je jich 14 a každou jsem upravil tak, aby byla osobní a česky vysvětlovala, co se děje a co má příjemce udělat. Bohužel Memberful češtinu přímo nepodporuje, takže některé části, které nemohu přepsat, se budou posílat v angličtině a výsledek bude tedy česko-anglický.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nastavoval jsem branding Memberful tak, aby ladil s JG&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nastavoval jsem tam vše ostatní - nabídku, kupóny, všechna zaškrtávátka, odkazy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integroval jsem Memberful s webem a toto jsem si připravil do vedlejší větve. Jedna z mála situací, kde jsem narušil trunk-based development a odvětvil jsem, protože se mi nechtělo řešit nějaký feature switch. Větev by stejně měla existovat jen do chvíle, než se finalizují obchodní podmínky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Díky tomu jsem také využil per-branch deployments, které mi dělá Vercel. Už delší dobu jsem myslel, že bych mohl zmigrovat na GitHub Pages, protože z pokročilých funkcí Vercelu vlastně nic nepoužívám, ale protože to zatím funguje, tak bylo snazší nic nedělat a zůstat, než někam odcházet. Teď jsem využil něco, co GitHub Pages nemají, a to deployment/náhled pro git větev. Náhled jsem mohl poslat i právničce, aby si mohla zkusit založit testovací členství. Samozřejmě mi tam našla nedostatky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/club/"&gt;stránku o klubu&lt;/a&gt; jsem si připravil tlačítka pro zakoupení předplatného a další odkazy. Hodně se mi líbí, &lt;a href="https://wip.co/join"&gt;jak to mají na WIP.co&lt;/a&gt;, ale to asi až v nějaké další verzi. Přidal jsem i nějaké informace, např. "Jsou údaje o mé platební kartě v bezpečí? Jasně! K údajům o tvé kartě nemá nikdo z junior.guru přístup, jsou bezpečně uchovány platební bránou Stripe. Je to světoznámá služba, která má hromadu zabezpečení a certifikátů." Za takto vágní větu mě asi &lt;a href="https://www.michalspacek.cz/"&gt;Michal Špaček&lt;/a&gt; nepochválí, ale myslím, že normálním smrtelníkům by mohla stačit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Připravil jsem stránku pro &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/tos/"&gt;obchodní podmínky&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Připravil jsem stránku pro &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/coc/"&gt;pravidla chování&lt;/a&gt; a naházel do ní text, který jsem měl doteď jen v Google dokumentu. Odkazy na pravidla jsem aktualizoval všude na Discordu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přeložil jsem formulář na zadávání pracovních nabídek do češtiny. Stejně to tam zadávali pouze česky mluvící lidé. Původně jsem myslel, že by se to mohlo dostat do ruky i cizincům pracujících ve větších firmách, ale reálně se to neděje a právnička bude mít klidnější spaní. Provozovat dvě verze mi přišlo zbytečné. Překlad políček se mi vůbec nelíbí, protože místo "website link" tam teď mám "odkaz na webové stránky firmy" nebo místo "pricing plan" tam mám "varianta z ceníku". Zní to hrozně. Překládal jsem to ale hladový ve vlaku, není to zas tak podstatné a už je pátek, tak to tak teď nechám. Horší spíš bylo, že kvůli přejmenování políček se mi rozbily věci na backendu, které data z Google Sheets stahují, takže jsem to musel ještě opravit v kódu i v testech. Do formuláře jsem přidal zaškrtávátka k souhlasům s obchodními podmínkami a zpracováním osobních údajů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zkoušel jsem, jestli funguje placení testovací kartou a jak fungují různá přesměrování z Memberful zpět na mé stránky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na radu právničky jsem dal do patičky webu přímý odkaz na kontakt. Dává mi to smysl, vlastně ani nevím, jak se mi povedlo tam takový odkaz nemít :D Nicméně zatím vede jen na stránku s ochranou osobních údajů, kde je na mě kontakt v prvním odstavci. Ještě nějaký kontakt je i na stránce pro média, takže je v tom binec a poznamenal jsem si, že teď do toho šťourat moc nebudu, ale v budoucnu v té patičce musím pouklízet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poslal jsem právničce detailní soupis toho, jak skrze JG protékají osobní údaje, aby mohla vytvořit nový a lepší text ke &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/privacy/"&gt;zpracování osobních údajů&lt;/a&gt;. Ten, co mám teď, jsem si napsal laicky sám.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="clubhouse"&gt;Clubhouse&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#clubhouse" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dostal jsem pozvánku do Clubhouse, ale zatím jsem si nenašel moc čas se tam porozhlédnout a něco si pořádně poslechnout. První dojmy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Než jsem se tam dostal, zjistil jsem si něco o této nové sociální síti. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1354116768671870979"&gt;Tento tweet je pojat jako mem&lt;/a&gt;, ale asi moc nezafungoval, protože moc srdíček nedostal. Zároveň je však myšlen i výsledek mého bádání. Odkazované video perfektně ukazuje, k čemu se může Clubhouse hodit a vidím díky němu potenciál, který tato nová síť vytváří. Odkazovaný článek zase popisuje, jak český Clubhouse ve svých počátcích vypadá kvůli tomu, že se šíří přes pozvánky. Jestliže se Twitter šířil přes geeky a ajťáky, Facebook přes studenty na Erasmu a Instagram přes teenagery, tak Clubhouse je jako byste dali mikrofon svému &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/yablko/status/1329013868149043201"&gt;feedu na LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;. Osazenstvo je silně nahnuto směrem k markeťákům a influencerům. Je na vás, zda vás baví představa, že posloucháte rozhovor Petra Máry s Petrem Ludwigem o tom, jak a komu ukápla zmrzlina na botu, nebo vás to spíš odpuzuje.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nežiju se sluchátkama na hlavě, takže pustit si nějaké povídání do uší je pro mě velmi vědomá činnost na kterou si musím vyhradit čas, pro kterou potřebuji konkrétní situaci v bytě a před kterou musím udělat hned několik úkonů. Je to asi jako kdybych si měl jít pustit gramofon. Myslel jsem, že jsem dobu dohnal, když jsem po letech odmítání trochu pronikl do světa podcastů, ale teď přichází nový level, Clubhouse. No uvidíme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co mě zarazilo, byla touha, s jakou Clubhouse chtěl všelijaké moje osobní údaje. A rovněž to, že jsem o tom nikde nezaznamenal absolutně žádnou diskuzi. Pozvánku nedostanete jinak, než poskytnutím svého telefonního čísla. Aby vám ji vůbec mohl někdo poslat, musí aplikaci poskytnout přístup ke všem svým kontaktům v telefonu. Jméno musí být jméno a příjmení, ne přezdívka. Myslel jsem, že po všech průserech Facebooku a spol. se v roce 2021 už vracíme k ochraně soukromí a přezdívkám (Reddit, Discord), ale zjevně i dnes může vzniknout nová a oblíbená sociální síť, která prakticky nefunguje, dokud o vás neví úplně všechno.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paradoxně díky tomu, že kontakty mám do mobilu jen načtené z Google Contacts, mohl jsem je snadno odpojit před tím, než jsem někomu poslal pozvánku. Po odpojení se můj seznam kontaktů vyprázdnil, já si tam ručně přidal jen danou osobu, pak aplikaci povolil přístup, poslal pozvánku, v nastavení přistup zase odebral a kontakty opět připojil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přidal jsem do &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/donate/#sponsors"&gt;seznamu podporovatelů&lt;/a&gt; Miu! Díky!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upgradoval jsem závislosti na svých a Pyvec webech.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Otestoval jsem mezi prvními &lt;a href="https://www.fakturoid.cz/podpora/nastaveni/dvoufazove-overeni"&gt;2FA na Fakturoidu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Četl jsem pár článků o tom, jak budovat komunity. Sleduji po očku také &lt;a href=""&gt;Indie Hackers&lt;/a&gt; apod. Napadlo mě ale, že jsou to všechno nějací amíci a ti řeší prostě jiné problémy, než řeším já. Rád bych sledoval nějaké místní solo tvůrce, nebo aspoň nějaké ze střední/východní Evropy. Na &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1354735756892319745"&gt;můj dotaz&lt;/a&gt; ale zatím nikdo neodpověděl :D Ach jo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poslechl jsem si nové fajn &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/yablko/status/1354079536078581765"&gt;video o pracovních pohovorech&lt;/a&gt; od yablka. Chtěl bych časem nějaká jeho videa vložit i rovnou do příručky, ale teď to nestíhám.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vytvořil jsem &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/logo.junior.guru"&gt;repozitář pro grafický manuál&lt;/a&gt; a zprovoznil jsem &lt;a href="https://logo.junior.guru/"&gt;logo.junior.guru&lt;/a&gt;. O tom jsem ale už napsal &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/graficky-manual/"&gt;samostatný článek&lt;/a&gt;. Když jsem se koukal na stránku pro média, zapsal jsem si, že v budoucnu tam musím změnit texty, protože už mi přijdou zastaralé (vytvářel jsem ji myslím napodzim, hehe).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Začala mi padat performance na stránce o klubu (&lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/monitoring-performance-with-lighthouse-and-circleci"&gt;kontroluju kontinuálně přes Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt;), ale rozhodl jsem se, že to zatím nebudu řešit. Až mergnu úpravy, které mám teď ve větvi, tak to poladím.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="co-planuji"&gt;Co plánuji&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#co-planuji" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tři věci, které bych chtěl zvládnout udělat příště:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dokončit obchodní podmínky a spustit klub! Otestovat na prvních lidech.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Věnovat se závazkům, které mám k pár dalším firmám a lidem (napsat jedné velké firmě, vytvořit banner, napsat článek).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Propagovat otevření klubu na sociálních sítích.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A ještě bod-nebod: Neměnit hlavní stránku, neuklízet v patičce, nepřepisovat texty, nic nemigrovat, prostě na nic na webu nesahat, dokud neuvidím, že lidi se hlásí do klubu a má smysl do čehokoliv z toho investovat energii a čas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-co-vy"&gt;A co vy?&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#a-co-vy" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud byste čistě náhodou měli dojem, že jste oproti mě za uplynulý týden vůbec nic nestihli, tak mám pro vás skvělou zprávu! V klidu se na ten dojem &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/neni-to-zavod/"&gt;můžete vykašlat&lt;/a&gt;. Není zač!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="co-me-zaujalo"&gt;Co mě zaujalo&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#co-me-zaujalo" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když si něco přečtu nebo poslechnu a líbí se mi to, &lt;a href="https://getpocket.com/@honzajavorek"&gt;sdílím to na Pocketu&lt;/a&gt;. Od posledních poznámek jsem sdílel toto:&lt;/p&gt;

Nepřekračujte s hovory 30min, delší z člověka totiž dělají zeleninu. Naplno se ukazuje, že firemní kultura není pingpongáč, ale hodnoty, naslouchání lidem, opravdovost.

Už nějakou dobu mám na junior.guru &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/press/"&gt;stránku pro média&lt;/a&gt; se sekcí o logu, barvách, fontech, správném psaní názvu projektu. Kamarád &lt;a href="https://www.jirichlebus.cz/"&gt;Jirka Chlebus&lt;/a&gt; si toho všiml, vyrobil přes Vánoce pro junior.guru profesionální grafický manuál a ten mi dal jako dárek. V krátkém článku napíšu, co se mi na tom líbí.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;iframe width="839" height="472" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aXA_DUFQbko" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grafický manuál se všemi potřebnými informacemi Jirka vytváří v podobě tzv. &lt;a href="https://visualbook.pro/"&gt;Visualbooku&lt;/a&gt;. Místo abych měl odkazy na logo a údaje o barvách nějak nepřehledně na webu, nebo aby to bylo v nějakém &lt;a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/technologies/java/java-licensing-logo-guidelines-1908204.pdf"&gt;několikamegovém PDF&lt;/a&gt;, naskládá to všechno přehledně do webové stránky. Ta pak žije třeba na &lt;a href="https://juniorguru.visualbook.pro/"&gt;juniorguru.visualbook.pro&lt;/a&gt;, ale je to jen statické HTML, CSS a trocha JS, takže to můžu vzít, upravovat, hostovat kde chci. Hodil jsem to tedy na &lt;a href="https://pages.github.com/"&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; a mám to na &lt;a href="https://logo.junior.guru/"&gt;logo.junior.guru&lt;/a&gt;, což se dá komukoliv snadno i nadiktovat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="Visualbook" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/visualbook.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Díky tomu, že mám teď na vizuální styl separátní webovku, mohl jsem &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/junior.guru/commit/c8591cb25f1ab9f0eb9819429735bee149c0fce2"&gt;udělat změny&lt;/a&gt;, ve kterých jsem ze stránky pro média odebral hodně nepřehledných odkazů a díky kterým z gitu zmizela spousta velkých souborů s fotkami. Ty teď můžu mít na Google Drive, což je upřímně pro takové věci o dost praktičtější. Předtím, kdybych chtěl přidat fotku, musel bych jít do gitu a měnit vše přímo v projektu. Teď mi stačí soubory přetáhnout sem a tam ze složky nebo do složky a hned se to projeví v grafickém manuálu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="Google Drive" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/visualbook-gdrive.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jak moc je Visualbook ve skutečnosti praktický nebo ne, jsem měl šanci si vyzkoušet překvapivě brzy. Během ledna dělám co můžu, abych mohl v rámci junior.guru &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/spoustim-klub/"&gt;otevřít zájmový placený klub&lt;/a&gt;. To zahrnovalo například nastavení platební brány &lt;a href="https://stripe.com/"&gt;Stripe&lt;/a&gt; nebo hotového řešení pro správu členství &lt;a href="https://memberful.com/"&gt;Memberful&lt;/a&gt;. Obě tyto služby mají možnost přizpůsobit branding tak, aby jejich uživatelské rozhraní zapadalo do mého webu a působilo na lidi povědomě, důvěryhodně. Ostatně, stejnou věc jsem už dřív nastavoval pro &lt;a href="https://eepurl.com/gyG8Bb"&gt;newsletter&lt;/a&gt;, který zase řeším přes &lt;a href="https://mailchimp.com/"&gt;MailChimp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="Stripe" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/visualbook-stripe.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
Nastavování vzhledu ve službě Stripe&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No a nastavování brandingu bylo s tímhle novým grafickým manuálem fakt radost. Hex kódy barev se kopírují na jeden klik, šup šup, logo, ikona a je to. Nemusím nic složitě hledat, všechno na jednom místě.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Další super věc je, že teď mám i stránku, kde je na příkladech vysvětleno &lt;a href="https://logo.junior.guru/naming.html"&gt;jak se má junior.guru správně psát&lt;/a&gt;. Já to všude píšu stylizovaně junior.guru, ale třeba novináři s tím celkem zápasili. Ono ani junior.guru nevypadá zrovna hezky, když s tím chcete začít větu, nebo dokonce nadpis. Časem jsem tedy vytvořil alternativu, která mě štvala nejmíň: Junior Guru. No a grafický manuál teď všem pěkně ukazuje, jak název správně psát a jak ho rozhodně nepsat. Nevím, jestli to někdo bude číst sám od sebe, ale stačí mi teď případné hříšníky upozornit, že v manuálu to mají vysvětlené.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do budoucna jsme s Jirkou domluvení, že případné aktualizace provede ručně on. Jde o obyčejné HTML a CSS, tak bych jednoduché věci zvládnul sám, ale je vygenerované, tak do toho nechci moc šťourat, aby se naše verze příliš nerozjely. Hlavně neočekávám, že vůbec nějaké změny budou. To, co by se měnit mohlo, můžu ovládat sám přes Google Drive a výrazné změny ve značce nechystám, dokud si na to junior.guru nevydělá. Vím, že to, co teď mám, je amatérismus splácaný na koleně, ale dokud se junior.guru pořádně nerozjede jako byznys, nemá smysl do něčeho takového zatím investovat. Nějaké ruční aktualizace Visualbooku mě tedy myslím omezovat nebudou. Těším se, že jednou za Jirkou přijdu, dám mu balík peněz na stůl a objednám celý nový vizuální styl :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No a to je vše, chtěl jsem se jen podělit o radost z vánočního dárku a o tip, jak lze taky pojmout grafický manuál, pokud zrovna něco takového řešíte. Myslel bych si, že pro junior.guru bude něco takového overkill, ale uběhlo jen pár týdnů a hned jsem to několikrát sám využil. Za využití Visualbooku jsem já osobně nic neplatil ani nedostal, spadám do Jirkovy charitativní činnosti (dělal třeba brand i pro &lt;a href="https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoroVent"&gt;CoroVent&lt;/a&gt;, nadšenci sestavený covidový ventilátor). O to, abych napsal takovýto článek na blog, se neprosil, udělal jsem to z vlastní vůle :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category></entry><entry><title>Týdenní poznámky #34: Εὕρηκα!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Εὕρηκα&lt;/em&gt; je takové to Archimedovo zvolání. Nechtěl jsem to tu mít latinkou, aby si lidi nemysleli, že mám něco společného s vyhledávačem zboží. Už tak jsem dostal za uši, když jsem měl v nadpisu HN a nebyly to HackerNews, ale Hospodářky. Musel jsem se kvůli tomu pak stát slavným nejen na Hospodářkách, ale i HackerNews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tento týden se nesl v duchu rozklíčování &lt;strong&gt;technického a procesního řešení nákupu členství&lt;/strong&gt;. Paralelně se mnou mi daňař odpovídal na dotazy ohledně daní a právnička pracovala na mých obchodních podmínkách.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="clenstvi"&gt;Členství&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#clenstvi" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V minulých poznámkách jsem skončil tím, že jsem v pasti a neumím vyřešit propojení Stripe a Discord. Nový týden jsem nastartoval s tím, že si musím dát nějaké konkrétní kroky, přes které se doberu výsledku:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poptat se na všech možných místech, zda to už někdo neřešil nebo neví, jak to řešit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ještě jednou projít hotová řešení a spočítat &lt;em&gt;pricing&lt;/em&gt;. Co kdyby to nakonec vycházelo nějak přijatelně?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Výsledkem prvního bodu byly dotazy na &lt;a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/1500000208241-How-can-I-say-which-Discord-member-came-through-which-invite-"&gt;supportu Discordu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65810723/how-can-i-say-which-discord-member-came-through-which-invite"&gt;na Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1351888926517186560"&gt;na Twitteru&lt;/a&gt;. Také jsem intenzivně hledal a přece jenom jsem nakonec něco našel. Pokud bych se nakonec rozhodl pro vlastní řešení, zřejmě by mě k němu dovedl &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@tonite/finding-the-invite-code-a-user-used-to-join-your-discord-server-using-discord-py-5e3734b8f21f"&gt;tento článek na Mediu&lt;/a&gt; a tato &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65074741/how-can-i-see-which-invite-link-the-newcomer-came-from/65074934#65074934"&gt;odpověď na SO&lt;/a&gt;. Jak ale vyplývá z formulace předchozí věty, rozhodl jsem se nakonec vybrat hotové řešení. Zvažoval jsem následující:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://memberful.com/"&gt;Memberful&lt;/a&gt; - Koupil je Patreon, skvělý support, spousta funkcí.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://launchpass.com/"&gt;LaunchPass&lt;/a&gt; - Malá firma, dobrý support, málo funkcí.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://upgrade.chat/"&gt;Upgrade.Chat&lt;/a&gt; - Platící bot, možná trochu něco jiného, než chci. Jakýsi strašně zmatený support přes Discord. Nejmenší marže, ale vyloučil jsem je vlastně celkem brzo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dále jsem se díval na:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://circle.so/"&gt;Circle&lt;/a&gt; jako na možnou alternativu Discordu a &lt;em&gt;all-in-one&lt;/em&gt; řešení. Líbil se mi design, nelíbil se mi ceník a funkce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://auth0.com/"&gt;Auth0&lt;/a&gt; jako na možný stavební blok pro přihlašování,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.memberstack.com/"&gt;MemberStack&lt;/a&gt; jako alternativu Memberful,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.memberspace.com/"&gt;MemberSpace&lt;/a&gt; jako další alternativu Memberful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="outsourcovat-nebo-ne"&gt;Outsourcovat nebo ne?&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#outsourcovat-nebo-ne" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stále jsem všechno zvažoval a rozvažoval. Hlavně jsem si nebyl jistý, zda mám opravdu něco takhle outsourcovat. Nakonec mě přesvědčily následující věci:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Udělal jsem si detailní tabulku pro výpočet předplatných, všech marží atd. Náhled níže. To mě přesvědčilo, že marže hotového řešení se tam vleze a že to pořád dává smysl.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Všechna hotová řešení jedou přes Stripe, který je &lt;em&gt;industry standard&lt;/em&gt; a sám má skvělé API, takže to není úplný &lt;em&gt;vendor lock-in&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Když jsem si četl o nejrůznějších funkcích jednotlivých řešení, pochopil jsem, že tohle si fakt sám programovat nechci. Možná bych dokázal vyrobit jednoduchý skript pro ten základ a něco bych ze začátku ušetřil, ale když jsem viděl, co všechno hlídají, jaké maily posílají, co vše jde nastavit, apod., najednou to nebylo jen "propojení Stripe a Discord", byla to hromada práce, kterou nebudu muset řešit. &lt;a href="https://memberful.com/help/how-to/collect-taxes/"&gt;Daně&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=""&gt;Kupóny&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přemýšlel jsem nad tím, jestli chci programovat řešení pro online členství nebo chci budovat komunitu, psát příručku a vylepšovat JG. Jasně mi z toho vyšlo, že tohle prostě není můj &lt;em&gt;core business&lt;/em&gt; a můj život bude mnohem šťastnější, když použiju hotovou věc a zaplatím za ni.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Z možných řešení jsem nakonec vybral Memberful. Líbilo se mi, že za nimi stojí společnost, která asi jen tak nezanikne, že dělají přesně to co chci a přesně způsobem, jakým chci. Mají dokumentaci a z jejich webu je vše zřejmé - hlavní výhoda oproti LaunchPass. Mají API, mají funkční a úžasný support (prohodil jsem s nimi asi 10 mailů, než jsem si vše ujasnil). Dokonce mají i drahou variantu s možností &lt;a href="https://memberful.com/help/how-to/manage-team-plans/"&gt;prodávat skupinové členství&lt;/a&gt;. Zprvu jsem myslel, že ji budu potřebovat, ale nakonec jsem to vymyslel jinak. Vědomí, že mi bude stačit levnější varianta, mě už definitivně přesvědčila.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="velke-pocitani"&gt;Velké počítání&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#velke-pocitani" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="Velké počítání" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/pricing-jg.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
Rozpočítávání cen, marží, nákladů. Mohu měnit čísla v modrých řádcích a vše se přepočítává. Mohu měnit i základní cenu nebo čísla kolem navržených nabídek pro firmy. Ty jsou ve velmi ranném stádiu uvažování.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když jsem si dělal tabulku, ve které se vše propočítávalo, zkoušel jsem si už rozvrhnout i nabídku pro firmy. Nejdřív jsem myslel, že by byla jedna za zhruba 10 000 Kč, kde by firma mohla pozvat třeba 10 nebo aspoň 8 členů, ale nevycházelo mi to jako moc výhodné. Částky 10 000 Kč ročně se chci ale držet, protože si myslím, že je to psychologická hranice, u které spousta firem mávne rukou a zaplatí ji klidně i jen proto, aby mě podpořili v tom, co dělám. Nakonec jsem zkusil načrtnout spíš dvě nabídky, jednu pro firmy s menším počtem lidí a druhou pro větší. Samozřejmě bude i třetí, pro všechny ostatní, ale ti mi napíšou e-mail a domluvíme se individuálně. Intuitivně jsem to rozdělil tak, že levnější varianta zaplatí za 6 vstupů a dražší za 18, ale pro jistotu jsem nadhodil ankety na &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/193575630828729/permalink/1674691469383797/"&gt;FB&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1351992847105478656"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, ať to není úplně vycucané z prstu. Prakticky potvrdily mou úvahu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No ale stejně to je celé zatím jen pro mou tabulku s čísly, takže o nic nejde. V nejbližší době nepočítám s tím, že se budu dělat s ceníkem na webu, prostě mi firmy napíšou na mail a dohodneme se. Taky to může skončit u toho, že bude nějaká fixní sazba za logo mezi členy klubu a pak dynamické "šoupátko", které výslednou cenu prostě vypočítá násobením počtu členů, které chtějí zaplatit. Třeba žádné "přednastavené" balíčky ani nebudou.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="memberful"&gt;Memberful&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#memberful" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memberful má &lt;a href="https://memberful.com/help/third-party-integrations/discord/"&gt;pohodlné propojení s Discord&lt;/a&gt;, umí CZK a celkově mi přišel nejlépe připravený pro to, co já potřebuji. Dá se vyzkoušet naživo bez toho, aby za to člověk platil - dokud se nerozhodnu, že to chci překlopit do ostré verze, jede to v testovacím režimu a můžu zkoušet i funkce, které jsou pro placené účty. To jsem dělal snad jeden celý den a vytvořil jsem si kvůli tomu i další testovací Discord server. Administraci a možnosti Memberful jsem dlouho poctivě proklikával. Díky tomu jsem pak i rozklíčoval dilema jak technicky řešit hromadné předplatné pro firmy, které chci dělat na fakturu. Zkoušel jsem různé nápady, např. že by každá firma měla svůj vlastní &lt;em&gt;plan&lt;/em&gt;, který jinak nepůjde koupit, a jenž bude určovat podmínky předplatného… ale pak jsem na to přišel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Udělám to přes &lt;a href="https://memberful.com/help/how-to/create-a-coupon/"&gt;kupóny&lt;/a&gt;! Objev kupónů a myšlenka, že se s nimi dá řešit skupinové předplatné byl hlavní &lt;em&gt;εὕρηκα&lt;/em&gt; moment tohoto týdne a udělal mi velkou radost. Do té doby jsem si připadal na dobré cestě, ale stále zaseknutý. S kupóny najednou vše začalo zase dávat smysl. Firma prostě nakoupí třeba 5 kupónů se 100 % slevou na rok a je to. Ať už je dá svým lidem nebo je někomu podaruje, vše bude fungovat. Akorát si napíšu Python skript, který mi udělá nějaký přehled v Google Sheets tabulce. Mohl by mi třeba i poslat mail, když se bude blížit vypršení doby předplacené fakturou, klidně sám kontaktuji firmu a dořešíme distribuci nové sady kupónů. Pokud firma za někoho platit už dál nebude chtít, tak ten nemusí odejít, může za sebe dál platit individuálně. Právě onen individuální aspekt kupónů a existence individuálních účtů, které firma jen předplatí, se mi na tom hodně líbí. Navíc mohu vytvářet kupóny i s menší než 100% slevou, že, a rozdávat je třeba do nějakých spřízněných komunit :) Ou jé.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abych nedopadl jak s propojením Stripe/Discord, rozhodl jsem se ještě opravdu vyzkoušet, že API od Memberful je použitelné a mohu přes něj udělat, co potřebuji. V testovacím režimu to naštěstí šlo. Mají GraphQL API, což jsou pro mě pořád ještě trochu vody, ve kterých tápu, ale s pomocí &lt;a href="https://github.com/graphql-python/gql/"&gt;gql&lt;/a&gt; jsem docela rychle splácal něco, co mi vyhodilo přesně ta data, která bych při integraci s mými Google Sheets potřeboval. A to už byl pátek, takže dál jsem už nic nedělal a mohu jít dnes spát s tím, že velké dilema je vyřešeno.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Having a surprisingly decent experience with &lt;a href="https://t.co/AGnJTBXgmJ"&gt;https://t.co/AGnJTBXgmJ&lt;/a&gt; Nice!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I remember trying to consume &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GraphQL?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GraphQL&lt;/a&gt; from a server-side &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Python?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Python&lt;/a&gt; script back in 2018. Huge drag! The tooling wasn't ready and many things were DIY. Now I can get a response on 4 lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;— Honza Javorek (@honzajavorek) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1352562694797275137?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tedy jsem se rozhodl vykopnout se z Patreonu dveřmi (časem chci zrušit &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/honzajavorek"&gt;svůj Patreon&lt;/a&gt; a nahradit jej právě členstvím v klubu) a přijít k němu oknem :D No, hlavně jsem rád, že jsem si to všechno mohl osahat a vyzkoušel jsem si i to API, takže za to mohu s klidným svědomím zaplatit, prohlásit přijímání členů a placení za vyřešené a posunout se na lepší věci. Na Stripe/Discord jsem se naučil, že je asi vždy lepší nejdřív si ověřit, zda předpoklady sedí i v realitě. Nestačí jen fakt, že existuje API, tak vše určitě nějak půjde :)) A taky jsem pochopil, že to není práce pro jeden skript. Že nejde jen o propojení Stripe/Discord, ale že kdybych se do toho pustil sám, programoval bych to a opravoval na tom chyby tak zhruba do konce života.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jinak další super věc na Memberful je ta, že se tam moji členové mohou přihlásit a je tam celý &lt;em&gt;billing portal&lt;/em&gt;, kde mohou změnit předplatné, zrušit, změnit kartu, atd. To by uměl i Stripe sám o sobě, ale jak jsem psal minule, tam bych musel já implementovat to přihlašování. A navíc, pokud bych v budoucnu chtěl vyrobit něco jako knížku nebo video pouze pro členy, mohu to nahrát do Memberful a po přihlášení do svého účtu na to budou mít všichni členové odkaz ke stažení apod. Teď to neplánuji, ale do budoucna se to hodit může a já k tomu budu mít už infrastrukturu bez práce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mailchimp"&gt;MailChimp&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#mailchimp" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Všiml jsem si, že Memberful má i pěknou integraci s MailChimpem, ale po pár dotazech na jejich support jsem se rozhodl, že ji zatím využívat nebudu. Můj newsletter vznikl už dříve a pro jiný účel. Spojovat bych to teď nechtěl, navíc si nejsem jistý, jak moc legálně to mají uděláno vzhledem k českým pravidlům - např. by se mi líbilo, kdyby tam bylo při registraci nezaškrtnuté zaškrtávátko, kde by si člověk mohl zvolit, že ode mě chce dostávat e-maily, ale to oni tak úplně neumí. Je to až moc automatické :) Nechávám na jindy nebo na nikdy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dane"&gt;Daně&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dane" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Svého daňaře jsem se vyptal na spoustu věcí, které mi vrtaly hlavou. V jedné z odpovědí mi napsal následující:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jde ale o tak specifickou situaci pro někoho kdo není plátce DPH, že jsem se s něčím takovým ještě nesetkal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moje první reakce byla: &lt;em&gt;Challenge accepted!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud by někoho zajímalo, jestli musím automaticky vydávat doklady, tak podle zákona o ochraně spotřebitele je povinnost vystavit doklad o poskytnutí služby, pokud o to zákazník požádá. Stejná povinnost je i v živnostenském zákoně.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pak jsem se ptal, jak to je, když může koncový zákazník samoobslužně nakupovat na mém webu kartou a já nejsem plátce DPH. Pokud přijde někdo ze Slovenska a nakoupí, velmi to neovlivním. Stanu se pak automaticky identifikovanou osobou nebo plátcem DPH? V podstatě jsem rozlišil čtyři situace:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Koncový zákazník z ČR, zaplatí kartou na webu, jednou za měsíc/za rok se mu strhne částka.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firma/podnikatel z ČR, má IČO, domluvíme se přes e-mail a já pošlu fakturu z &lt;a href="https://www.fakturoid.cz/"&gt;Fakturoidu&lt;/a&gt; a třeba za rok pošlu další.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Koncový zákazník ze SR nebo odkudkoliv jinud z celého světa. Platební brána bude na webu a kdo zaplatí, dostane členství. Logicky nemohu nijak omezit nebo ověřit odkud člověk je. Protože je má služba česky, mohu se domnívat, že ze zahraničních koncových zákazníků to bude zajímat hlavně Slováky, ale reálně to může být kdokoliv.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firma/podnikatel mimo ČR. Ti nemohou nakupovat přes platební bránu, museli by se se mnou domluvit, takže jim snadno mohu říct, že službu neposkytuji mimo ČR, pokud se nechci stát ID osobou/plátcem DPH, a z obchodu nic nebude.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Případ 2. dělám odjakživa. Případ 1. je pro mě nový, takže nevím, jaké má náležitosti, ale nebojím se ho. Případ 4. mohu snadno ručně vyloučit, takže se ho taky nebojím. Co mě straší je případ 3., protože je de facto mimo mou kontrolu. Pokud bych jej měl mít pod kontrolou, musel bych nějak v platební bráně zamezit lidem platit, pokud nejsou z ČR, ale to mi moc nedává smysl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Podle všeho, pokud nebudou prodeje do EU běžným smrtelníkům vyšší než 10 000 EUR/kalendářní rok, tak údajně DPH řešit nemusím. Po překročení bych se nejspíš stal identifikovanou osobou a musel bych se přihlásit do MOSS. Než budu mít vysoké výdělky, nemuselo by mě ani zajímat, odkud ti lidé jsou, ale pro jistotu je lepší si to někde evidovat, abych případně mohl prokázat, zda ty vysoké výdělky ze zahraničí (ne)mám. EU do směrnice k DPH zařadilo i demonstrativní výčet důkazů, které můžu použít k prokázání, ze kterého státu lidi jsou:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fakturační adresu příjemce,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;adresu internetového protokolu (IP) zařízení používaného příjemcem nebo jakýkoli způsob geolokalizace,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bankovní údaje, například místo, kde je veden bankovní účet používaný k placení nebo fakturační adresa příjemce, již má uvedená banka k dispozici,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mezinárodní směrový kód země (MCC) mezinárodní identifikace mobilního účastníka (IMSI) uložený na SIM kartě, kterou příjemce používá,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;místo pevné linky příjemce, jejímž prostřednictvím je mu služba poskytována,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;jiné informace důležité z obchodního hlediska.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takže stačí i celkem vágní informace jako IP adresa. Super :) Pro mě je to důležité hlavně proto, že se teď ještě nechci stát plátcem DPH a také proto, že chci, aby formulář pro placení musel obsahovat co nejméně políček. Čím víc políček k vyplnění, tím menší šance, že formulář někdo dokončí a opravdu zaplatí.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V nativním macOS terminálu, který teď zkouším používat místo iTerm2, mi zatím chyběla jediná věc, a to skákání šipkama po slovech se zmáčknutým altem/option. Zjistil jsem ale, že to jde &lt;a href="https://osxdaily.com/2013/02/01/use-option-as-meta-key-in-mac-os-x-terminal/"&gt;zapnout jediným zaškrtávátkem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poděkoval jsem e-mailem někomu, kdo mi už vloni v létě radil něco v tom smyslu, že vydělat by se v mém případě dalo nejlépe asi na nějakém placeném členství apod. věcech. Trvalo mi jen tři čtvrtě roku na to přijít sám.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Člověk, který prosazoval sponzorování JG v jedné firmě, měl teď prezentaci o tom, jak se jim ta investice vyplatila. Trochu jsem mu pomáhal s přípravou. Vypadá to, že výsledky dobrý! 40 % kandidátů byly ženy, 2 lidi přijali.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ozvala se korporace, že jsem jejich dodavatel a mám jim ihned poslat spoustu údajů. Údaje jsem dodal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jako OSVČ jsem od ledna zvýšil pravidelnou zálohu na zdravotní pojištění.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spadl mi scraper na &lt;a href="https://weworkremotely.com/"&gt;WWR&lt;/a&gt;, protože měli v JSONu text, jehož součástí byla i sekvence znaků pro tzv. &lt;em&gt;shrug&lt;/em&gt;, tedy krčení ramen, a nebylo to nijak ošetřeno (zpětné lomítko). Opravil jsem to tak, že když se něco takového stane, holt se nabídka práce přeskočí ¯\_(ツ)_/¯&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Měl jsem hovor s právničkou, kde jsme dolaďovali obchodní podmínky. To, že jsem vybral Memberful, nám zodpovědělo spoustu nevyjasněných otázek, takže další palec nahoru pro hotové řešení.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="pyvec"&gt;Pyvec&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#pyvec" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upgrade knihoven na různých Pyvec projektech (přes Dependabot).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spadla hlavní větev na webu Pyvce, a to proto, že Twitter už definitivně odebral možnost přes jednoduché URL získat avatar uživatele. Musel jsem to celé odstranit a nyní mohou &lt;a href="https://pyvec.org/#members"&gt;obrázky členů Pyvce&lt;/a&gt; pocházet už jen z Gravataru nebo GitHubu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Měli jsme pravidelnou schůzi výboru Pyvce. Pár věcí jsme vyřešili. Přijali jsme do spolku nového člena.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="redis-collections"&gt;Redis Collections&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#redis-collections" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kdysi dávno jsem napsal knihovnu &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/redis-collections/"&gt;redis-collections&lt;/a&gt;. Byl to můj první balíček na PyPI, napsal jsem k tomu svou první dokumentaci na ReadTheDocs, prostě můj první opravdový Open Source. Koukám se, že to bylo v lednu 2013, tedy před osmi lety. Knihovně jsem se věnoval, ale pak jsem změnil práci a už jsem ji nadále sám nepotřeboval, takže trochu umírala na nezájem. V roce 2016 se ale objevil nějaký &lt;a href="https://github.com/bbayles"&gt;Bo Bayles&lt;/a&gt; z druhého konce zeměkoule a navrhl, že by se o to dál staral. Postupně jsme si předali žezlo a od té doby na tom zahradničí on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nedávno se ozval s tím, že by chtěl vyhodit Travis CI a vyměnit jej za GitHub Actions, ale nemá všechna potřebná oprávnění. Proto jsem se na to tento týden mkrnul:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přidal jsem současného správce jako spoluvlastníka balíčku na PyPI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vytvořil jsem organizaci na GitHubu: &lt;a href="https://github.com/redis-collections/"&gt;github.com/redis-collections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nastavil jsem nás oba jako vlastníky&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přesunul jsem repozitář pod novou organizaci&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pak jsem si říkal, že by byla škoda mít na organizaci výchozí náhodný obrázek, že by to chtělo nějaké logo. Takže jsem stáhl SVG logo Redisu, otevřel v Inkscape, dal &lt;em&gt;ungroup&lt;/em&gt;, smazal text a různé detaily a přes červené destičky napsal v Arial Black iniciály projektu, RC. Zabralo to 5 minut. Dalších 15 minut zabralo správně nastavit rozměry dokumentu a vše vycentrovat a exportovat správně do PNG. I když jsem mu jasně řekl, že to byl jen pokus a klidně to můžeme zahodit, tak Bo napsal, že logo je nádherné a bude ho používat. Aby mi neleželo jen někde na disku, vytvořil jsem pro něj repo &lt;a href="https://github.com/redis-collections/logo"&gt;logo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ano, asi není úplně správné vzít něčí logo a derivovat z něj svoje. Dnes už třeba vím i to, že není správné ani pojmenovávat věci slovem "Redis", když nemám s Redisem nic společného, protože tím nejspíš porušuji jejich ochrannou známku. U nových projektů bych to už vymyslel jinak, ale tady mi přišlo, že logo vytvořené z loga Redisu bude konzistentní s názvem knihovny, který je vytvořený z názvu Redisu, a že to doteď nikomu nevadilo, tak snad OK. Pokud mi někdo z Redisu napíše, že to není OK, samozřejmě to odstraním nebo knihovnu přejmenujeme. Zatím jsme aspoň přidali &lt;a href="https://github.com/redis-collections/redis-collections/commit/4dc6b6bfd57928f3d3ceb0ece6880148f900b8d4"&gt;tuhle větu do README&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když už jsem byl u takových detailů, po svém angažmá v Oracle jsem se &lt;a href="https://github.com/redis-collections/redis-collections/pull/136"&gt;podíval i na licenci a věci kolem toho&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="vylepseni-skriptu-na-tydenni-poznamky"&gt;Vylepšení skriptu na týdenní poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#vylepseni-skriptu-na-tydenni-poznamky" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ve volné chvilce jsem se podíval na skript &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/honzajavorek.cz/blob/master/weeknotes.py"&gt;weeknotes.py&lt;/a&gt;, kterým generuji šablonu pro každé nové týdenní poznámky:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opravil jsem kód, který chybně vytvářel odkaz na minulé poznámky v prvním odstavci.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přidal jsem novou sekci "Co plánuji" (k vidění o kousek níž), která by mi měla pomáhat určovat si trochu priority na další týden a zpětně sledovat, jak se mi tyto plány drží dodržovat. Cílem není vyčerpávající seznam, ale napsat si tři nejdůležitější věci, které bych fakt měl udělat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Napadlo mě, že by v poznámkách mohla být vždy jedna věta o tom, kolik jsem měl za poslední týden pohybu. Vám by to ukázalo, jak je každá odrážka v poznámkách vykoupená tím, že se nehnu od počítače. Mě by to třeba pomohlo víc se motivovat vyrazit ven na procházky, běhat, projet se na kole. Zjistil jsem ale, že &lt;a href="https://www.strava.com/"&gt;Strava&lt;/a&gt; má API přístupné jen přes OAuth2, je tedy nutná interakce uživatele, abych mohl stáhnout data o svých aktivitách. Taková API úplně nenávidím. Jak to nemá API token, nejde to pořádně použít ze skriptu a nebo jde, ale je to hrozná otrava.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zkusil jsem pak ještě přístup "když to nemá použitelné API, třeba se to dá scrapovat" a na pár řádcích se mi opravdu povedlo napsat Python skript, který se přes mé jméno a heslo přihlásil do Stravy a viděl moje poslední aktivity. Pak bych ale musel nějak přes CSS nebo XPath vysekávat jednotlivé kousky jako kolik km nebo datum a to už jsem si řekl, že se mi kvůli jedné větě v poznámkách dělat momentálně nechce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Možná jsem si měl jít radši zaběhat?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tři věci, které bych chtěl zvládnout udělat příště:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Propojit Memberful s webem junior.guru&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mít hotové obchodní podmínky&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pověnovat se &lt;a href="https://juniorguru.visualbook.pro/"&gt;Visualbooku&lt;/a&gt;, který jsem dostal k Vánocům od &lt;a href="https://www.jirichlebus.cz/"&gt;Jirky&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myslím, že by se mi mohlo povést klub na přelomu ledna a února už spustit pro veřejnost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-co-vy"&gt;A co vy?&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#a-co-vy" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud byste čistě náhodou měli dojem, že jste oproti mě za uplynulý týden vůbec nic nestihli, tak mám pro vás skvělou zprávu! V klidu se na ten dojem &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/neni-to-zavod/"&gt;můžete vykašlat&lt;/a&gt;. Není zač!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;V pondělí jsem vydal &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/spoustim-klub/"&gt;článek o spuštění klubu&lt;/a&gt; a potom jsem se několik dní potýkal s "následky" :) Kromě ohlasů a poptávek to byla i zcela roztříštěná pozornost, která mi bránila efektivně dělat cokoliv jiného. V noci jsem nemohl spát a myslel na to, jak udělám placení za klub. Ve dne jsem byl zase spánkově deprimovaný a roztěkaný ze všech notifikací, takže jsem nedokázal nic pořádného udělat. Aspoň na ty poptávky jsem se snažil odpovídat a videohovory s lidmi byly taky užitečné. V závěru týdne jsem se snažil vyřešit jak budu od lidí sbírat peníze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="clanek-o-spusteni-klubu"&gt;Článek o spuštení klubu&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#clanek-o-spusteni-klubu" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Po vydání článku nastala smršť reakcí, takže v pondělí jsem už nic moc jiného neudělal. Reakce byly velice pozitivní a zájem je do dnešních dní velký:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hned dva noví &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/donate/"&gt;pravidelní podporovatelé&lt;/a&gt;, jeden anonymní a &lt;a href="https://github.com/petrjakubec"&gt;@petrjakubec&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;několik poptávek a zvolání od jednotlivců, že chtějí být členy klubu hned, jak to vůbec bude možné,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;poptávky minimálně hned od tří firem na větší objem členů:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samozřejmě stojím o to dostat logo své malé firmy ke klubu. Zároveň bych měl rád nějaký počet členství v klubu pro juniory, které tu mám. A pravděpodobně i pro sebe, kde bych to mohl vzít z druhé strany a spíš tam pomáhat a trochu něco komunitě vracet. Mohlo by být výhodné i to, že sám budu radit svým juniorům ne v pouze interní firemní komunikaci, ale na Tvé platformě, kde by z toho mohli těžit i další.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volal jsem si také s velkým šéfem jedné vzdělávací firmy se skoro 9000 studenty a s jednotlivcem, který má zájem klub podporovat a radil mi, co si mám pohlídat na cenové politice a celkově strategii. S firmami se zatím bavím o balíčku, který je za zhruba 10 000 Kč na rok a v ceně je logo na stránce klubu a přístup pro zhruba 10 členů. Pokud udělám hrubý odhad založený na tom, jaká poptávka je už teď, je dost možné, že se během 24 hodin od otevření dostanu na 100 platících členů.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Článek je hodně dlouhý, takže mi lidi psali vítězoslavné zprávy, když se jim povedlo jej po třech dnech dočíst. V článku jsem byl hodně upřímný a myslím, že se to vyplatilo. Lidé mi fandí, drží palce, posílají poptávky. Myslím, že to je pro ně/vás trochu &lt;em&gt;reality show&lt;/em&gt;. Můžete být součástí mého dobrodružství, mého případného úspěchu, můžete a chcete se na tom podílet. Kdybych si všechno syslil pro sebe, nikdy takové emoce v lidech nevybudím.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No a hlavně to celé vypadá, že jsem konečně na něco kápnul. Že by tohle mohlo fungovat :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="neni-to-moc-levne"&gt;Není to moc levné?&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#neni-to-moc-levne" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S velkou odezvou jsem se musel zamyslet nad otázkou, zda není klub moc levný nebo co budu dělat, kdyby tam byly tisícovky aktivních lidí. Do této chvíle jsem se spíš obával, že to nikoho zajímat nebude a budu rád, když nasbírám 50 nadšenců, ale teď začínám promýšlet spíš druhý konec možných scénářů, tedy co se může pokazit, pokud by lidí přišlo hodně.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Určitě by nebylo dobré, kdyby se během jednoho dne přihlásilo 1000 lidí. Sice bych vydělával 100 000 Kč měsíčně a do budoucna mohl některé věci automatizovat nebo outsourcovat, ale určitě ne hned a lidi by se mohli akorát naštvat, že klub nefunguje, stejně jako to dnes bylo s registrací na očkování. Nemělo by to při prvním náporu celé vybouchnout, měl bych tam mít malé množství lidí a na něm bych měl nejdříve testovat, co funguje a co ne. Také si jsem vědom, že mohu v lidech vzbuzovat velká očekávání, že si do klubu mohou spoustu věcí promítat, ale skutečnost bude jiná. A já navíc ani nevím, jaká přesně bude, ať mohu mít jakoukoliv vlastní představu, protože to nakonec záleží hlavně na tom, jací lidi se přidají a jak spolu budou interagovat. Pokud bude členství příliš levné, lidé nebudou dostatečně "volit peněženkou" a nebudou mi svým chováním adekvátně ukazovat, co dává smysl, co nedává, co jim za něco fakt stojí.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Přemýšlení o těchto věcech jsem nakonec uzavřel s tím, že to nechám, jak jsem to původně vymyslel a nejdřív se nechám překvapit, jaký bude opravdu reálný zájem a první reakce. Vždycky mohu po prvních 300 lidech říct, že takový úspěch jsem nečekal a abych zachoval kvalitu, kterou jsem schopen reálně poskytnout a ukočírovat, musím to na chvíli zavřít pro nové členy a třeba i zvýšit cenu. A kdo si to nemůže dovolit, bude mít možnost zapsat se do nějakého &lt;em&gt;fin aid&lt;/em&gt; programu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="technicke-reseni-placeni"&gt;Technické řešení placení&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#technicke-reseni-placeni" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Už jsem psal, že jsem se díval na různá hotová řešení, ale nakonec jsem se rozhodl, že nějak zkusím slepit Pythonem &lt;a href="https://stripe.com/"&gt;Stripe&lt;/a&gt;, Discord a Google Docs. Myšlenka byla taková, že Stripe má hodně už hotového, já nad tím budu mít velkou kontrolu a budu moci flexibilně řešit nesystémové případy, kterých je vždycky plno.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stripe má krásnou dokumentaci a všechno strašně pěkně vyladěné, takže jsem to měl za chvilku nasazené a mám hotové tlačítko na webu, na které když kliknu, tak se to přesměruje na jejich &lt;em&gt;checkout&lt;/em&gt;, kde člověk vyplní kartu a hotovo. No a tady je jeden problém. Hotovo znamená, že člověk zaplatil, ale co potom?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moje stránky jsou statický web. Stripe má webhooky, ale to se mi moc nechce provozovat. To zní jako spousta programování, synchronizací dat a nočních incidentů. Vymyslel jsem, že jednou za půl hodiny by se mohl na CircleCI spustit job, který se podívá na Stripe, jestli tam nejsou nějaké nové účty, a těm pošle přes Discord API pozvánky do klubu. Sice by platící člověk musel půl hodiny počkat na pozvánku, ale to by šlo asi přežít. Taky by se tím vyřešilo i propojení, protože přes Discord API nevidím o uživatelích nic, ani e-mail. Říkal jsem si, že přes ty pozvánky budu moci nějak identifikovat kdo zaplatil za co. Když si to pak stáhnu do Google Sheets, můžu tam mít i údaje z Fakturoidu o tom, která firma si zaplatila za co v rámci manuální fakturace. Čtvrtek jsem zakončil tím, že jsem měl funkční tlačítko na webu se Stripe integrací, které dokáže vyrobit nové předplatné.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V pátek mi došlo, že by ale uživatel měl mít možnost změnit kartu, zrušit předplatné, apod. Stripe na to má hostovaný &lt;em&gt;billing portal&lt;/em&gt;, ale aby se do něj člověk dostal, musí se u mě nejdřív nějak přihlásit. To je opět blbost, žádné přihlašování provozovat nechci, potřebuji to akorát propojit s Discord účty. Narazil jsem na řešení přes &lt;a href="https://mysuperportal.com/"&gt;SuperPortal&lt;/a&gt;, které vytváří &lt;em&gt;magic link&lt;/em&gt; pro přihlášení. Takové práce, přitom taková blbost. Řekl jsem si, že SuperPortal by mohlo být řešení - dovedu si představit, že si to časem nějak vyřeším sám, ale do té doby to bude stačit a hlavně není problém něco takového v budoucnu vyměnit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dále jsem chtěl vytvořit nějaký skript, který bude stahovat data ze Stripe, Discordu, Fakturoidu, propojovat je, případně mi je nasype na jednu hromádku do Google Sheets, do kterých mohu následně dělat i manuální úpravy, když někdo bude chtít něco nesystémově měnit. A tady jsem narazil. Zjistil jsem, že asi fakt nedokážu nijak propojit Stripe platbu s účtem na Discordu, protože ty pozvánky fungují jinak, než jsem myslel. Jednak to vypadá, že pozvánky nejsou unikátní, ale jsou &lt;em&gt;hashem&lt;/em&gt; toho, s jakým nastavením ji člověk vyrobí. Kdybych chtěl vyrobit pro každého uživatele pozvánku se stejným nastavením, měla by zřejmě stejný &lt;em&gt;hash&lt;/em&gt; a byla by to tatáž pozvánka, a uživatele by tedy nijak unikátně neidentifikovala. Taky jsem nepřišel na to, jak přes ně vlastně vůbec dotrasovat ty uživatele, kteří ji využili. Na tomto jsem zatím skončil a vzhledem k tomu, že je pátek večer, nechávám to už být.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Existují hotová řešení a zřejmě si je budu muset znova projít a zvážit, jestli mi nemohou něco vyřešit. Blbé je, že ona hotová řešení zpravidla neřeší něco, co potřebuju. I kdybych zatím rezignoval na &lt;em&gt;fin aid&lt;/em&gt; (nebo stipendia, jak to někdo nazval), což je taky celkem složité na realizaci, stejně potřebuji minimálně nějaké soužití členů hromadně fakturovaných na firmu, členů zaplacených přes samoobslužnou bránu, chci platby účtovat v českých korunách, chci umět podchytit nesystémové věci, jako že nějakého uživatele přeřadím pod jiný účet nebo že dostane předplatné zadarmo. U některých služeb, které Stripe využívají, české koruny prostě nepodporují, ačkoliv sám Stripe je umí. Já chci smazat co nejvíce překážek k tomu, aby lidé měli chuť si klubové členství zaplatit, takže ceny v dolarech nebo eurech považuju za problém nejen z hlediska financí, konverzí, účetnictví, ale i UX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, nadšený ze svých pokusů a zjištění nejsem, ale třeba mi někdo poradí, něco z těch hotových řešení vyberu, nebo mě něco napadne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="placeni-a-slovensko"&gt;Placení a Slovensko&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#placeni-a-slovensko" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když jsem viděl, jak &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/yablko/status/1349024089390936072"&gt;yablko vydal nový kurz&lt;/a&gt;, došlo mi, že bych měl umět řešit i členy ze Slovenska. Napsal jsem daňovému poradci:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud si dám na web platební bránu (konkrétně https://stripe.com/ ) a začnu lidem něco prodávat, zajímá mě, jak je to s doklady a s daněmi:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jaké informace jsem povinen od koncových zákazníků sbírat? Adresa?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jaký doklad jsem povinen vydat? Stačí e-mail s nějakými údaji, nebo bych měl přes Fakturoid každému poslat doklad jako kdyby to byla faktura, jen tam nebude IČO?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Co si hlídám u koncových zákazníků? Co když mi přes platební bránu zaplatí někdo ze Slovenska? To přece nemohu nijak ovlivnit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neleze mi do hlavy, že by přišel člověk ze Slovenska, něco si ode mě koupil a já se rázem stal plátcem DPH. Dokonce mi neleze do hlavy ani to, že bych po lidech měl chtít adresu. Pokud bych byl OSVČ a prodával koblížky na náměstí, tak přece vůbec nevím, jestli kolemjdoucí byl mimo EU a na adresu se jej taky neptám.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Přečetl jsem si kamarádův &lt;a href="https://milavotradovec.cz/blog/advent-of-haskell/"&gt;článek o Haskellu a Advent of Code&lt;/a&gt; a dal mu nějaké připomínky, než to vydal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V klubu jsem se snažil rozproudit diskuzi o GitHubu a Open Source.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V soukromých zprávách v klubu jsem intenzivně řešil s jedním juniorem jeho hledání práce a pohovory, s druhým zase co je dobré projít si za témata z teoretické informatiky.&lt;/li&gt;

Spousta lidí prostě z 80 % svého platu nevyžije, jsou živnostníci, nebo pracují úplně načerno, takže v karanténě by byli zcela bez příjmu.&lt;/li&gt;

Hodnotu bude mít hlavně pro ty, kdo mě sledují dlouhodobě.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="Klub pro juniory" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/klub.jpg"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="klub"&gt;Klub?&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#klub" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chystám se spustit &lt;strong&gt;placený zájmový klub&lt;/strong&gt; pro začátečníky v programování, dobrovolníky, mentory, profesionály, náboráře a další, které baví sdílet spolu tipy a podávat juniorům pomocnou ruku. Členský příspěvek bude stovka měsíčně. Mezi hlavní výhody členství patří možnost něco komunitně probrat, sdílet tipy a družit se s lidmi, kteří řeší podobné věci. Dále možnost &lt;strong&gt;dostat zpětnou vazbu na CV, projekty, GitHub, kariérní rozhodnutí&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Další informace jsou &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/club/"&gt;přímo na stránce klubu&lt;/a&gt;, včetně FAQ, kde jsou nejspíš zodpovězeny všechny ty dotazy, které vám nyní vyvstaly v hlavě. Následující text se bude zabývat tím, jak jsem ke spuštění klubu došel z podnikatelského hlediska.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rocni-bilance"&gt;Roční bilance&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#rocni-bilance" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V listopadu 2020 uběhl rok od chvíle, kdy jsem začal podnikat. První dva měsíce na volné noze jsem si dal více méně oddech a nevydělával nic, takže je reálně nikde nezapočítávám, ale srovnání od ledna do ledna už nějaký smysl dává.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když to rozpočítám, &lt;strong&gt;vydělal jsem v roce 2020 zhruba 10 000 Kč měsíčně&lt;/strong&gt;. Na junior.guru jsem pracoval celý rok na plný úvazek, dodržoval jsem víkendy, státní svátky a bral jsem si dovolené. Nejsou v tom započítány žádné osobní výdaje a ani daně, které asi žádné velké platit nebudu, ale jsou od toho odečteny výdaje na podnikání a zálohy na sociální a zdravotní (zhruba 5 000 Kč měsíčně). Ty jsem ovšem díky covidu-19 několik měsíců platit nemusel. Složení příjmů je následující:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="Zisk" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/jg-finance-2020.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
Legenda: &lt;em&gt;sideline&lt;/em&gt; jsou faktury za melouchy nesouvisející s junior.guru, &lt;em&gt;jobs&lt;/em&gt; jsou platby za inzerci pracovní inzerátů, &lt;em&gt;donations&lt;/em&gt; jsou dobrovolné příspěvky, &lt;em&gt;handbook&lt;/em&gt; jsou příjmy od sponzorů za umístění loga na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/candidate-handbook/"&gt;příručce&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cílem je dostat se na 35 000 Kč měsíčně&lt;/strong&gt;, což je průměrná hrubá mzda v Česku. Bez toho nemůže junior.guru dlouhodobě zůstat jako něco, čemu se věnuji na plný pracovní úvazek. Jak vidno, ani nemusíme odečítat vedlejšáky a rozdíl je i tak velký. Co s tím můžu dělat?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="zamer"&gt;Záměr&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#zamer" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Než se pustím do problémů a jejich řešení, rád bych v první řadě osvětlil, proč jsem vůbec začal s podnikáním. Mám jasný cíl a ten poměrně přesně vymezuje, jakou cestou se mohu ubírat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mezi lety 2007 až 2014 jsem podnikal jako webový vývojář, programátor, API konzultant. Nyní jsem do toho šel s úplně jinou, velmi konkrétní vizí. Mým záměrem je vytvořit službu jako produkt, a to v jednom člověku. Cílem není „zbohatnutí“ na úspěšném startupu (mám &lt;a href="https://byznys.ihned.cz/c1-65593630-oracle-kupuje-za-miliardy-korun-cesky-start-up-apiary-zakladatele-ve-firme-zustavaji"&gt;odškrtnuto s Apiary&lt;/a&gt;) ani vytvoření „pasivního příjmu“ (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1227091135220207616"&gt;mýtus&lt;/a&gt;). Chci vytvořit něco, co tak akorát uživí mou rodinu a co mě bude bavit vylepšovat každý den, spoustu let. Zároveň něco, co nezávisí jedna ku jedné na mém čase, což je běžně většina práce na volné noze (hodinovka). Mělo by to trochu „škálovat“. Hlavně proto, abych od práce oddělil stres. Abych si mohl vzít dovolenou, být nemocný nebo pečovat o dítě, a ta věc přitom stále fungovala. Pokud se do těchto mantinelů nevejdu, nemám potřebu to lámat přes koleno. Toto by mě bavilo nejvíc, ale hned na druhém místě by bylo běžné zaměstnání programátora v nějaké fajn firmě. Pokud se mi službu jako produkt nepovede vytvořit, v pohodě to zabalím a půjdu někam programovat, protože vím, že mě to bude určitě bavit víc, než např. rozjíždět konzultace a školení. Nemusím podnikat za každou cenu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vytyčenému cíli a jeho mantinelům se musí podřídit jak byznysová stránka věci, tak technická. V jednom člověku nemohu například vytvářet složitý &lt;em&gt;SaaS&lt;/em&gt;, který bych musel při nějakém problému opravovat ve tři v noci.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Z možností reálně vypadává většina kusového prodeje produktů, protože jsem zatím neobjevil takové, které bych chtěl tvořit jak na běžícím páse a zároveň by měly dostatečně velké publikum, jenž by jednorázovými nákupy nasbíralo dostatečnou hodnotu. Třeba jednou najdu zálibu ve videích nebo podcastech, ale zatím mě to neláká. Jediné, co dělám opravdu rád, je psaní. Texty lze prodávat jako knihy, ale u těch nevychází ani základní kupecké počty, neuživilo by mě to. Navíc by jistě byly druhý den po vydání někde na Uložto. Přijde mi, že jednorázově placenými produkty se v Česku moc uživit nedá a lidé je tvoří buď jako hobby, nebo jako marketingový nástroj jiných svých aktivit. Třeba se ale mýlím.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snažím se ctít pravidlo, že nebudu ostatním dělat to, co sám nemám rád. Proto na webu nechci klasickou reklamu nebo &lt;em&gt;paywall&lt;/em&gt;. Byť se snažím nějakým způsobem svůj obsah monetizovat inzercí (nabídky práce, umístění loga), klasickou generickou reklamu bych tam nikdy nedal, stejně jako si zatím nikde reklamu neplatím, a nad rámec počítání návštěv nesleduju lidi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nabidky-prace"&gt;Nabídky práce&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#nabidky-prace" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když jsme u kupeckých počtů, pojďme si ukázat, že jsem junior.guru začal vytvářet jen díky tomu, že jsem si na začátku žádné počty neudělal. Původní idea byla taková, že projekt bude hlavně &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/"&gt;seznamem pracovních nabídek pro juniory&lt;/a&gt; a uživím se tím, že firmy budou za nabídky platit. Říkal jsem si, že je to jednoduchý, léty osvědčený byznys model, který by sice firmu neuživil, ale když ty drobky posbírám já, jednotlivec, třeba to stačit bude. Měl jsem si ovšem udělat základní průzkum a spočítat, že i kdyby u mě byly všechny juniorní nabídky v Česku, nejspíš by mě to ani tak neuživilo. Kromě toho, brzy přišel covid-19 a rozmetal i to málo, co mohlo být. Hlavní důvody, proč se mi nepovedlo nastartovat příjmy z nabídek práce:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nemám téměř žádný marketing vůči cílovce&lt;/strong&gt;. Junioři mě milují a já miluji je. Jenže pokud jde o nabídky práce, cílovkou musí být ten, kdo platí, tedy recruiteři, HR, firmy. &lt;a href="https://www.startupjobs.cz/"&gt;StartupJobs&lt;/a&gt; nebo třeba &lt;a href="https://smitio.com"&gt;Smitio&lt;/a&gt; si toto uvědomují a mají vůči recruiterům perfektní marketing. &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/648891055753967/"&gt;Pořádají pro ně akce&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.startupjobs.cz/vzdelavani/pruvodce-hr-nejen-pro-juniory"&gt;vytváří pro ně obsah&lt;/a&gt;, apod. Já sice sem tam &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/honzajavorek/"&gt;napíšu na LinkedIn něco zajímavého&lt;/a&gt;, ale tím to nespasím. A hlavně, je mi proti srsti to otočit. Rozhodně chci dělat prostředníka a bavit se jak s juniory, tak i s firmami a recruitery. S náboráři jsem vždy byl v kontaktu rád, bral je jako parťáky, mám mezi nimi kamarády. Jenže srdíčko mám prostě u těch začátečníků, ti jsou moji, těm chci pomáhat. Otočit se naplno směrem k firmám by znamenalo, že recruiter je můj zákazník a uchazeč by tak byl hlavně zboží, stejně jako je to na všech pracovních portálech.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Můj web nevypadá jako web s nabídkami práce.&lt;/strong&gt; To je možná důvod, proč mě mají rádi junioři a média, ale zároveň to poškozuje byznys. Srovnejte web &lt;a href="https://junior.guru"&gt;junior.guru&lt;/a&gt; s jakýmkoliv jiným pracovním portálem. Na většině je hned z úvodní stránky jasné, že jde o pracovní portál. Třeba &lt;a href="https://weworkremotely.com/"&gt;WWR&lt;/a&gt;. Výrazné nabídky, výrazné tlačítko na zadání nabídky, cena. Na obsahovou část s radami zpravidla vedou ty nejméně výrazné odkazy. Na WWR mají zrovna celkem užitečné rady, ale u jiných portálů obsah nezřídkakdy vzniká jen kvůli SEO a pokud někomu někdy pomůže, je to spíš vedlejší efekt. V takovém případě jde většinou o blog, aby šlo vydávat články označené datem vydání a následně je nechávat bez další zodpovědnosti mizet v historii internetu. Málokdy se najde něco jako permanentně aktualizovaný obsah. Já to mám úplně naopak.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kdo má předplatné jinde, inzeruje juniory tam&lt;/strong&gt;, ačkoliv je to dražší. Pokud má firma kredity na StartupJobs nebo Jobs, nebude inzerovat jinde. Má svoje cestičky vyšlapané, nemá důvod něco měnit. Že je web zaměřený přímo pro juniory, to není dostatečný tahák. Firmy chtějí seniory. Juniory ve většině případů nabírají proto, že seniory neseženou, ne proto, že je vyloženě chtějí.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inzerátů přímo pro juniory je málo&lt;/strong&gt;. Firmy většinou neumí, nechtějí nebo nemohou juniory zaučovat, takže upřednostní seniory, pokud nějaké najdou. Inzeráty se přinejlepším píšou neurčitě, aby získaly co nejvíc kandidátů. Všechna čest těm, kteří si dají tu snahu napsat text inzerátu tak, aby vůbec juniory oslovil, ale většina firem do juniorů nechce investovat ani to. Inzeráty, které se objeví různě po internetu, je potřeba ještě filtrovat, protože mnohé &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/hvtn0i/oc_only_26_of_jobs_marked_entrylevel_are_actually/"&gt;pro začátečníky nejsou svými nároky ani přesto, že to deklarují&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inzerce juniorních pozic není příliš efektivní&lt;/strong&gt; a já tu efektivitu nemohu zaručit. Trh s juniory je úplným opakem trhu se seniory. Na nabídku práce pro seniory se nepřihlásí nikdo, jsou rozebraní. Nahánějí je tedy specializovaní &lt;em&gt;headhunteři&lt;/em&gt; a vyhlédnutému člověku jsou ochotni pomalu poslat štrúdl jen proto, aby se dostavil na nezávazný pokec (moje osobní zkušenost). Začátečníků je naopak hodně a zájem firem o ně je vlažný. Na nabídku práce se přihlásí klidně desítky uchazečů. To nábor komplikuje, protože juniory lze podle zkušeností třídit jen omezeně a pokud chce firma třídit podle „nadšení“, nezbude jí, než si všechny pozvat a posuzovat více méně podle sympatií. To je dost náročné a firmám se to nemusí chtít absolvovat, zvlášť když jde o nábor juniora, do kterého potom ještě dál musí investovat. Těch několik málo firem, které mají dlouhodobý zájem o juniory, nakonec jejich nábor řeší spíš přes spolupráce s univerzitami nebo vlastní programy. &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/candidate-handbook/"&gt;Příručkou pro juniory&lt;/a&gt; sice kandidáty kultivuji a zvyšuji jejich připravenost, ale lepší efektivitu zaručit nemohu, protože jde o veřejnou inzerci, na kterou může odepsat kdokoliv. Musel bych web přebudovat tak, aby kandidáti mohli firmy kontaktovat jen pokud prokážou určitou znalost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neřeším firmám žádný problém.&lt;/strong&gt; Většina firem juniory řeší jen proto, že musí, ne proto, že chce. Jejich reálný problém je, že neexistuje dostatek zkušenějších lidí. Když toto zmíním, většinou dostanu radu, ať zkusím jednu z následujících strategií:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jít přes CSR,&lt;/strong&gt; tedy &lt;em&gt;corporate social responsibility&lt;/em&gt;. Můžu jim říkat, že podporou junior.guru přispívají kultivaci celého trhu, což se jim dlouhodobě vyplatí. Toto dělám s &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/candidate-handbook/"&gt;příručkou&lt;/a&gt;, viz níže. Není to služba jako produkt. Shánění sponzorů je &lt;em&gt;sales&lt;/em&gt;, což je práce přímo úměrná vloženému času.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dělat předvýběr&lt;/strong&gt; šikovných juniorů nebo mentoring těch, které už přijali. Profily a předvýběr juniorů chtělo dělat Levio, dnes na levio.cz už nic není. Pozadí příběhu neznám. Předvýběrem a dodáváním těch nejlíp připravených juniorů se živí bootcampy. Kdyby za něco takového byly firmy ochotné systematicky platit, tak školné studenty nestojí 100 000 Kč. Nějaké příležitosti do budoucna vidím, ale nic, co by mohlo být můj hlavní příjem a šlo to realizovat hned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zvýšit poptávku&lt;/strong&gt; po juniorech. Mohl bych firmy přesvědčovat, že pro ně má smysl juniory nabírat, vytvářet materiály, dělat školení. Mohl bych vydat knihu o tom, jak s juniory pracovat, jak zajistit, že se budou rychle učit, že do roka firmu neopustí, atd. To vše bych dělal rád a dělat to budu, protože chci, aby těch nabídek bylo víc, aby ve firmách bylo víc juniorů a aby tam byli spokojení. Ale jako doplňkovou činnost pro osvícené firmy, nemůže v tom být jádro mých příjmů. Nebyl by to byznys model založený na řešení problému, ale na jeho vytváření. Chodit po firmách a říkat jim, že něco, na čem jim příliš nezáleží, dělají blbě, a měli by to dělat lépe, a že já mám zrovna skvělé řešení… to už je jen malý krok k tomu, aby ze mě byl &lt;a href="http://prigl.cz/brnaci/koucove-obchodnici-s-velkym-hovnem/"&gt;pan Lorenc&lt;/a&gt;, deset korun na hodinu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tím vším nechci říct, že pracovní portály nefungují, nabídky práce jsou k ničemu a že inzerce práce na junior.guru od zítra končí. Body výše jsou zobecněné a zjednodušené. &lt;strong&gt;Pracovní inzeráty jednoznačně dávají smysl jako součást junior.guru&lt;/strong&gt; a hodnotu přinášejí jak firmám, tak juniorům. Chodí tam 5 300 lidí měsíčně, firmy inzerují. &lt;strong&gt;Pouze jsem popsal, proč neumím junior.guru z příjmů za pracovní inzeráty uživit.&lt;/strong&gt; Chybějící objem nevynásobí nízkou cenu a chybějící vyšší hodnota pro firmy nedovoluje cenu zvednout. Napadly mě ještě dvě věci, kam by šlo nabídky práce posunout, ale ani jedna není cestou, která by z nich udělala hlavní zdroj příjmů:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expanze do zahraničí.&lt;/strong&gt; Uvažoval jsem nad expanzí do Londýna, Dublinu, Berlína… Nevyzkoušel jsem to, protože:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jsem si říkal, že nejdřív ověřím byznys model v Česku a teprve až zjistím, že funguje v malém, budu se jej pokoušet násobit expanzí do zahraničí.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;junior.guru je hodně obsahové. Překládání a rozvíjení dvou mutací by i v minimálním objemu víc jak dvakrát zpomalilo můj postup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kvůli počátečním nákladům jsem do toho nechtěl jít, dokud si nebudu jistý. Kvůli fakturaci do zahraničí bych se musel stát plátcem DPH, což se jednak těžko vrací zpět, jednak je to byrokracie navíc. Že bych mohl prorazit s prototypem, kde se za nic neplatí, mě napadlo až později, ačkoliv jsem přesně tak začal v Česku.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Četl jsem hodně &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/"&gt;/r/cscareerquestionsEU&lt;/a&gt; a nabyl jsem nakonec dojmu, že v zahraničí jsou stejné problémy s nabídkami práce pro juniory jako tady, akorát větší. Data nemám, jen dojmy, ale myslím, že jsem asi o nic nepřišel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Důraz na diverzitu.&lt;/strong&gt; Pokud firmě záleží na diverzitě a myslí to vážně, nemůže najímat lidi pouze ze standardních zdrojů, protože na celém současném IT trhu je pouze 10 % žen. Dřív v IT moc žen nebylo, takže teď je jich logicky nejvíc mezi juniory. Já nabízím zdroj juniorů, který má silné vazby na komunity pro ženy a oslovuje i rekvalifikované lidi s přesahy do jiných oborů (bývalý horník přeučený na programátora je taky diverzita). Tento směr se mi líbí a do budoucna na něm chci pracovat v rámci nabídky korporátním zákazníkům, pro které něco takového dává asi největší smysl. Jestliže se mnou na něčem takovém máte zájem spolupracovat, napište mi na &lt;a href="mailto:ahoj@junior.guru"&gt;ahoj@junior.guru&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="dobrovolne-prispevky"&gt;Dobrovolné příspěvky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dobrovolne-prispevky" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Výrazným příjmem se v konečném součtu staly &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/donate/"&gt;dobrovolné příspěvky&lt;/a&gt;. Jejich původním cílem bylo nenásilně monetizovat juniory. Ještě jsem stihl „GitHub Sponsors Matching Fund“, takže se mi částky z GitHubu zdvojnásobují. &lt;strong&gt;Zhruba 35 % z celkové částky příspěvků mi poslal GitHub&lt;/strong&gt; a až přestane zdvojnásobovat, což bude do pár měsíců, nemohu s nimi už počítat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Původně jsem chtěl mít těžiště příjmů ve firmách a začátečníkům, často nízkopříjmovým, jsem nic účtovat nechtěl. Brzy jsem ale z děkovných dopisů a nadšených reakcí vypozoroval, že lidí, kteří v radách na junior.guru vidí hodnotu, je opravdu hodně. A kde je vnímaná hodnota, tam by mohly být peníze. Nečekal jsem od toho mnoho, ale existující případy lidí platících za kvalitní práci, jako jsou kniha &lt;a href="https://practicaltypography.com/why-you-should-pay.html"&gt;Practical Typography&lt;/a&gt;, podporovatelé &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/yablko"&gt;yablka&lt;/a&gt;, sponzoři &lt;a href="https://github.com/sponsors/ondrejmirtes/"&gt;Ondřeje Mirtese&lt;/a&gt;, nebo dřív &lt;a href="https://www.fffilm.name/p/ffffriends.html"&gt;FFFFriends&lt;/a&gt; u Fuky, mě přece jen motivovaly to zkusit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peníze přichází, za což jsem nesmírně vděčný a dělá mi to ohromnou radost, ale nakonec &lt;strong&gt;přichází spíš od fanoušků než od juniorů&lt;/strong&gt;. Ať je mé vysvětlení na webu jak chce dojemné, působí jen na lidi, kteří už dávno v IT pracují, mají peníze a chtějí mě podpořit v tom, co dělám. Juniorů, kteří mě podporují, je minimum. Ze začátku občas někdo poslal jednorázově 500 Kč na účet jako poděkování a sem tam jsem za konkrétní pomoc obdržel i vyšší jednorázový příspěvek. Vždy mi udělaly radost, ale pro přežití projektu jsou podstatné hlavně pravidelné, měsíční platby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Výzvu k dobrovolným příspěvkům jsem měl i skrz naskrz &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/candidate-handbook/"&gt;příručkou&lt;/a&gt;, ale ač na ni zavítala kvanta lidí, nestávali se z nich přispěvatelé. Po několika měsících jsem to vyhodnotil a výraznější výzvy k příspěvkům odebral, protože neměly efekt a čtenáře tedy pouze nutily víc scrollovat. To nepíšu nějak zhrzeně, jen konstatuji svá zjištění. Zde jsou důvody, proč si myslím, že lidé nepřispívají:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traduje se, že obecně je &lt;strong&gt;chuť za něco platit&lt;/strong&gt; v Česku menší než třeba v USA. Navíc to není tak velký trh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cílím na &lt;strong&gt;skupinu, která neoplývá penězi&lt;/strong&gt; a tudíž nemá pocit, že má na rozdávání. Ve chvíli, kdy jim junior.guru nejvíc pomáhá, ještě na rozdávání nemají. Když už mají, což může trvat několik let, na junior.guru si už nevzpomenou. Nebo možná vzpomenou, ale junior.guru existuje teprve rok :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lidé &lt;strong&gt;neznají GitHub Sponsors, Patreon&lt;/strong&gt;, Stripe, PayPal. Nechce se jim tam kvůli mě registrovat, učit se to, nedůvěřují tomu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Češi &lt;strong&gt;nejsou na ten koncept zvyklí&lt;/strong&gt;. Znají klasický obchod, kde něco dostanou a zaplatí za to. Poslední dobou se, myslím, celkem naučili posílat jednorázové dobrovolné příspěvky. Ovšem pravidelně někoho dobrovolně podporovat i přesto, že vše co dělá, je k dispozici zadarmo, to je psychologicky zřejmě nejtěžší kalibr a zvládne to jen malé procento lidí.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vyvozuji z toho, následující:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Existují lidé, kteří nejsou junioři, ale fandí tomu, co dělám, a jsou ochotni mi na to přispívat svými penězi. Možná bych je mohl nějak rovnou zahrnout do toho, co dělám.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Junioři vidí úplně největší hodnotu v tom, co dělám, ale nedokážou ji dobrovolně ocenit penězi. Možná by mi pravidelně nějakou malou částku posílat zvládli, kdyby to byl normální obchod (něco za něco), normálním způsobem (karta, banka).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jak jste si asi domysleli, klub tyto body splňuje. Členství je něco za něco, navíc je to koncept dobře známý z jiných zájmových činností (kroužky, sportovní kluby, spolky, politické strany, všude se nějaké členství běžně platí). Přispívat mohou jak fanoušci, tak junioři. Fanoušci navíc nemusí nic sledovat z povzdálí a jen držet palce, mohou se v klubu družit a pomáhat i jinak, než jen stovkou měsíčně.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="loga-na-prirucce"&gt;Loga na příručce&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#loga-na-prirucce" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Původně jsem &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/candidate-handbook/"&gt;texty o shánění práce&lt;/a&gt; začal psát jako obsah, na který budou chodit ti začátečníci, kteří se chystají hledat si práci. Díky tomu se měla zvednout návštěvnost na pracovních inzerátech. Jenže jsem psal a psal a najednou jsem toho měl nějak hodně na to, aby to bylo jen tak na webu jako stránka s pár radami. Přemýšlel jsem, zda tento exkluzivní obsah nelze monetizovat. U prodeje v podobě knihy mi nevycházely kupecké počty, takže jsem se nakonec rozhodl firmám umožnit dát si do záhlaví logo a nejmasivnějším marketingem, jaký umím, zajistit, že příručka bude mít velkou návštěvnost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Možnost &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/hire-juniors/#handbook"&gt;umístění loga firmy na příručku&lt;/a&gt; je v současné době mou nejvýdělečnější záležitostí, dělá 56 % příjmů. Platí si je ale zatím hlavně firmy, se kterými mám nějaký osobnější vztah. Na září, kdy příručka s velkou pompou vyšla, jsem sehnal první loga, ale pak už jsem &lt;strong&gt;nebyl dál schopen systematicky oslovovat další firmy, kterým bych logo na příručce nabízel&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Příčinou budiž, že jsem dobrosrdečný &lt;em&gt;geek&lt;/em&gt;, který má k prodávání daleko. Design nebo marketing zvládnu, byť amatérsky, ale &lt;em&gt;sales&lt;/em&gt; jde proti mé povaze a mám s tím problém. Pokud někdo přijde a řekne, že chce něco koupit, tak mu vše vysvětlím, zavolám si s nimi, udělám první poslední. Nemám problém komunikovat s lidmi. Ale neumím nabízet a prodat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Racionálně mi nepřijde oslovování firem těžké. Nemusím mít extrémní výkon nebo se tomu věnovat intenzivně, stačí si to naplánovat, mít nějaký dobrý „letáček“, každý týden oslovit pár lidí, komunikovat s nimi, zavolat si, poslat fakturu. Můžu hledat výmluvy, ale realita je taková, že jsem toto neudělal a teď nevím nic o tom, jestli by to fungovalo nebo ne a kolik peněz bych takovým způsobem byl schopen vydělat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na druhou stranu, &lt;strong&gt;není to služba jako produkt&lt;/strong&gt;. Jasně, nic se neprodává samo, i produkt potřebuje &lt;em&gt;sales&lt;/em&gt;, ale já si nemůžu dovolit věnovat se jako jednotlivec prodeji způsobem, při kterém se hodinový vklad přímou úměrou promítá do zisku. Chtěl bych mít základ byznysu v samoobslužném MRR, &lt;em&gt;monthly recurring revenue&lt;/em&gt;, a k tomu jako doplněk komunikovat s firmami. Můžu dělat marketing, můžu sem tam skočit na hovor se zákazníkem, ale nemůže to stát na tom, že mám CRM a jedu nějaké kobercové bombardování. Nebo může, ale já to neumím a asi ani nechci dělat. Přesvědčování by se mělo ideálně aspoň z 80 % odehrávat formou marketingu a konverze z prodejních stránek na webu. „Ruční“ sales je úkrok stranou směrem k „ruční“ fakturaci hodinovky za programování, konzultace nebo školení.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicméně zpět k logům. Jednu firmu se mi povedlo ukecat na prodloužení, ale ne na celý rok. Jiná firma, se kterou zatím není jednání u konce, přišla úplně sama a řekla, že chce být vidět, budovat značku vůči juniorům, a že jim toto dává perfektní smysl, takže kupují na rok. Mezitím v únoru vyprší umístění loga dvěma firmám.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Závěr? Loga umí vydělat peníze. Není to MRR, takže člověk nikdy neví, na čem je a jak to bude za pár měsíců. Neumím a nechci dělat „podomní prodej“. Hodnota pro firmy je v &lt;em&gt;hiring brand awareness&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;corporate social responsibility&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;diversity &amp;amp; inclusion&lt;/em&gt;. Není to tedy úplně řešení palčivých problémů velkého počtu firem, je to spíš taková charita. Mám zatím velké mezery v tom, abych porozuměl, zda se toto dá vytěžit víc, jaký ceník dává největší smysl, kolik je tady firem, které toto zajímá, apod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="co-se-da-delat"&gt;Co se dá dělat?&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#co-se-da-delat" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Můžu projekt &lt;strong&gt;převést do hobby režimu&lt;/strong&gt;. Odeberu placené funkce, obsah nechám být, aktualizace budou nahodilé, v mém volném čase. Najdu si normální práci jako programátor. Toto zatím neplánuji v blízké době udělat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Můžu projekt &lt;strong&gt;převést do polovičního úvazku&lt;/strong&gt;. Budu se mu věnovat částečně a zkusím zbytek vyplnit normální prací jako programátor. Toto zatím také neplánuji udělat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Můžu založit spolek a &lt;strong&gt;budovat neziskovku&lt;/strong&gt;. Kromě toho, že už se &lt;a href="https://pyvec.org/"&gt;na jedné neziskovce podílím&lt;/a&gt; a člověk by to asi neměl přehánět, nic to reálně neřeší. Asi bych jako spolek mohl snadněji přijímat dary a danit příjmy, do detailu tomu nerozumím, nicméně peníze na provoz bych musel sehnat tak jako tak. Své dny bych tedy trávil buď stejným způsobem jak teď, nebo bych se musel ponořit do shánění sponzorů a grantů, což je totéž co &lt;em&gt;sales&lt;/em&gt;. Děkuji, spíš ne :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Můžu se konečně &lt;strong&gt;zakousnout do &lt;em&gt;sales&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, vytvořit jasnější a přímočařejší nabídku pro firmy a čekat, co mi kdo dá. Určitě možnost, pokud bych neviděl jiné východisko. Raději bych ale našel nějakou cestu k MRR a toto měl spíš jako šťavnatý doplněk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Můžu zkusit &lt;strong&gt;monetizovat juniory&lt;/strong&gt;, což je ta cílovka, pro kterou reálně od počátku pracuji a které přináším největší hodnotu. Pokud by vytvořili hlavní příjem v podobě MRR, tak věřím, že spolu s náhodně rozloženými příjmy od firem bych se mohl těm 35 000 Kč měsíčně přiblížit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="klub-jako-reseni"&gt;Klub jako řešení&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#klub-jako-reseni" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Klub je nejen řešením výše uvedených problémů, má spoustu dalších synergií na všechny strany. Přemýšlím nad ním už od listopadu a vše do sebe zapadá jako puzzle. Celé roztříštěné portfolio služeb, které nabízím, lze nyní zjednodušit na členství v klubu. Stačí akorát vysvětlit jeho hodnotu všem zúčastněným.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hlavni-produkt-komunita"&gt;Hlavní produkt: komunita&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#hlavni-produkt-komunita" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ve své základní podobě je junior.guru statická stránka s textem a pracovními nabídkami. Klub je způsob, jak to udělat interaktivnější a spojit lidi. Vytváření komunity mě dlouhodobě baví. Mohu využít zkušenosti z organizace &lt;a href="https://pyvo.cz/brno-pyvo/"&gt;brněnského Python srazu&lt;/a&gt; a obecně z Python komunity. Schválně jsem ale pro pojmenování vybral slovo klub. Komunita mi evokuje něco otevřeného, zdarma, s rozmlženými hranicemi. Klub mi evokuje uzavřenější zájmový spolek. &lt;strong&gt;Začátečníci kolem sebe potřebují další lidi, aby se dokázali efektivně posouvat&lt;/strong&gt;, ať už to jsou radící senioři, mentoři, koučové, nebo i jen lidé, kteří putují stejným směrem. Už jen to, že v tom nejste sami a vidíte, že podobný problém řeší i jiní lidé, je velká pomoc a motivace. Online klub je podle mě skvělý způsob, jak toto v nějaké formě umožnit, a to především teď během pandemie, kdy se zastavilo mnoho srazů, kurzů, konferencí. Ale i bez covidu-19 by to mělo smysl dělat online, protože se tak mohou sdružit i lidi z regionů, kde srazy ani kurzy běžně nejsou. Nic nenahradí osobní setkání, ale klub může být dostatečně dobrá náhrada, v podstatě „sraz pro začátečníky jako služba“. Zároveň nikde není řečeno, že v budoucnu nemohu klub přenést i do reálných setkání.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hlavni-cilova-skupina-juniori"&gt;Hlavní cílová skupina: junioři&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#hlavni-cilova-skupina-juniori" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Členství v klubu generuje MRR, tedy stabilní a předvídatelný příjem, díky kterému vím na čem jsem a mohu lépe plánovat. Je to sice monetizace začátečníků, které jsem se od začátku bránil, ale narovnává to všechno, co je na mém byznys modelu špatně. &lt;strong&gt;Junioři jsou ti, pro které vše od začátku dělám a kdo nejvíc ocení mou práci.&lt;/strong&gt; Junioři jsou můj šéf, má cílovka. Určitě se chci bavit i s firmami a dělat prostředníka, ale primárně tu chci být pro juniory jako jejich doktor, právník, psycholog, ambasador. To mě baví nejvíc. Ale stejně jako doktor nebo právník, ač bych chtěl pomoci všem, musím si za svou práci říct o peníze. Pokud si mě nezaplatí, je fér si říct, že po tom, co dělám, není dostatečná poptávka nebo to neumím prodat, a zabalit to. Výhodou je, že na rozdíl od právníků nemusím žít z vysoké hodinovky, mohu částku &lt;strong&gt;rozložit mezi mnoho lidí a každému svými radami v klubu pomoci aspoň trochu&lt;/strong&gt;. Nebude to mít takovou kvalitu, jako kdybych si s někým dal 1:1 kariérní konzultaci, ale mnoha lidem to bude stačit. Bude to „kariérní konzultace jako služba“. Zároveň mohu díky tomu tvořit materiály dostupné pro všechny a sbírat inspiraci na další témata, která se v dotazech opakují a bylo by dobré je zpracovat. Čím víc dotazů obslouží příručka, tím víc bude škálovat moje „manuální práce“ v klubu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Klub narovnává i věc, kterou jsem doteď dělal neoficiálně a zadarmo, a to rady v soukromých zprávách. Za ten rok, co pro juniory pracuji, mi přišla spousta dotazů od jednotlivců, ať už šlo o rady s CV, kariérou, Pythonem, čímkoliv. Vždy jsem ochotně odpověděl a poradil, někdy jsem nad tím strávil i celý večer. Nic jsem si neúčtoval, maximálně jsem navrhnul, aby mi poslali &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/donate/"&gt;dobrovolný příspěvěk&lt;/a&gt; ve výši, kterou uznají za vhodné. Nyní bude jasné, že pokud chce někdo takovouto pomoc, má vstoupit do klubu a tam se mu budu ochotně osobně věnovat. Také pro mě bude jednodušší si tyto věci organizovat, protože budou na jednom místě a ne v mailu, Twitter DMs, Messengeru, apod. Rovněž bude snadnější je večer vypnout v rámci &lt;em&gt;work-life balance&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="penize-hodnekrat-malo-plus-firmy"&gt;Peníze: hodněkrát málo plus firmy&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#penize-hodnekrat-malo-plus-firmy" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cílem je, aby bylo členství tak levné, že si jej bude moci dovolit skoro každý. Rozhodl jsem se pro stovku měsíčně (plus nějaké ty koruny navíc na poplatky platební brány apod.). Je tedy jasné, že jedu na množství. Pokud bude v klubu 300 lidí, vydělám 30 000 Kč měsíčně. &lt;strong&gt;Juniorů je hodně a můj odhad je, že jich do budoucna bude jen víc.&lt;/strong&gt; Klub navíc není jen pro juniory, ale pro všechny, kteří se kolem juniorů chtějí motat. Jak jsem popisoval výše, někteří lidé mě chtějí prostě i jen podpořit v tom, co dělám. Nyní mi posílají peníze a v podstatě za to nic nemají. Pokud si místo toho koupí členství v klubu, budou to mít jednak levnější, jednak se mohou navíc ještě družit a angažovat. Samozřejmě pokud chtějí, nikdo je nenutí klub využívat, mohou mi klidně jen dál posílat peníze :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na web mi chodí přes 5 000 lidí měsíčně. Už 300 se zapsalo do newsletteru a skoro 700 se jich přidalo do skupiny na Facebooku, což už považuji za nějakou interakci. Jasně, zadat kreditku je trochu jiná úroveň interakce, ale i přesto věřím, že své zájemce si to najde. Je reálné do klubu dostat 300 platících lidí? Nevím, ale nepřijde mi to nereálné. Za písničky na Spotify lidé platí. Proč ne za něco, co jim zlepší šance na vysněnou kariéru?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co vidím jako velkou výhodu, je &lt;strong&gt;narovnání toho, kdo je můj zákazník&lt;/strong&gt;. V minulosti jsem dokázal junior.guru &lt;a href="https://nazory.ihned.cz/c7-66842510-ofofc-cf514314230baa8"&gt;dostat do médií&lt;/a&gt; a vytvořit tak na webu velkou návštěvnost. Byli to ale lidé, kteří se chtějí učit programovat, ne recruiteři. Přetavit tuto návštěvnost na peníze bylo „přes ruku“. Dokážu si představit, že s klubem to bude jiné. Pokud správně přepracuji úvodní stránku webu, mohu přímočaře sledovat, kolik procent přicházejících zájemců o programování „konvertuje“ na platící členy klubu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;K tomu všemu pořád počítám s firmami.&lt;/strong&gt; Zatím pro ně nemám ustálenou nabídku, ale nápadů, jak by mohl být klub firmám užitečný je hodně. Vidím velké synergie jak s příručkou, tak s nabídkami práce. Umístění log na příručce se s členstvím v klubu propojí do jednoho balíčku. Věřím, že klub může odkrýt nové možnosti, jak si může firma vytipovat šikovné juniory nebo jak poskytnout svým juniorům nějakou přídavnou „záchytnou sociální síť“, když si nevědí rady. Navíc by klub mohl začít být zajímavý i pro firmy, jejichž cílovkou jsou také junioři, tzn. pořadatele kurzů, akcí, bootcampy, apod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Další věc, nad kterou přemýšlím, je &lt;em&gt;barter&lt;/em&gt; v podobě nějaké &lt;strong&gt;slevy pro členy&lt;/strong&gt;, čímž firma cílovou skupinu naláká na svůj produkt. Trochu jako ISIC pro studenty, který mladým lidem dává slevu na služby a produkty v době, kdy ještě nevydělávají peníze, aby na ně později už byli zvyklí a používali je i za plnou cenu. V případě klubu může firma svůj produkt dostat k lidem ještě předtím, než se z nich stanou IT profesionálové s vysokými platy. Nehledě tedy na to, že v klubu nejsou jen junioři. Toto může být zajímavé pro firmy, které provozují konference, kurzy, vydávají knihy o programování, vytvářejí softwarové produkty, apod. Peněz by z toho pro mě moc nebylo, ale klub by měl nějakou publicitu a jeho členové by si mohli kromě toho všeho, co už mají, užívat za stovku měsíčně i nějaké (snad) užitečné slevy. Zásadní je, že toto se dojednává špatně, pokud jde o otevřenou komunitu (např. Python komunita), ale velmi snadno, pokud jde o uzavřený klub, který má jasně dáno, kdo do něj patří a má tedy na slevu nárok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="pracovni-nabidky"&gt;Pracovní nabídky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#pracovni-nabidky" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inzerce na junior.guru je stále zřejmě nejlevnější (500 Kč) a nejzacílenější způsob, jak vypsat pracovní nabídku nebo stáž pro začátečníky, navíc s velkým přesahem do komunit pro ženy a ty, kdo se rekvalifikují z jiných oborů. Na rozdíl od jiných portálů, junior.guru &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/hire-juniors/"&gt;umožňuje zadat nabídku práce i úplně zadarmo&lt;/a&gt;, pokud spolupracujete s &lt;a href="https://pyladies.cz/"&gt;PyLadies&lt;/a&gt; nebo jste neziskový či začínající projekt. Na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/"&gt;stránce s inzeráty&lt;/a&gt; se agregují nabídky i odjinud a každý den je robot filtruje podle toho, jestli jsou dostatečně juniorní. Uchazečům tedy stačí chodit na jedno místo, nemusí složitě pročesávat internet. Toto všechno rozhodně zůstane dál v provozu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V rámci členství v klubu mohu firmám nabízet paušál na pracovní inzeráty, posílat členům klubu upozornění na nové nabídky, apod. V klubu si lidé mohou &lt;strong&gt;snadno sdílet jakékoliv juniorní pracovní inzeráty, na které narazí na webu&lt;/strong&gt;. Mnohokrát se mi stalo, že mi někdo poslal odkaz na nabídku, kterou můj robot na internetu nenašel. I když jsem firmu oslovil, na junior.guru to většinou už nedala a já zase v současném systému nemám způsob, jak zadat nabídku práce do databáze jen tak z URL. Nyní na takové nabídky bude přímo kanál v online klubu a já mohu snadno naprogramovat nějaké propojení se &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/"&gt;seznamem na webu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zároveň mám v hlavě nápad na další produkt, jenž by řešil &lt;strong&gt;dohazování šikovných juniorů firmám&lt;/strong&gt;, ale ten bude mít smysl začít zpracovávat až ve chvíli, kdy bude klub v plném provozu, a já uvidím, že to celé má nějakou budoucnost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nova-message-a-usporadani-webu"&gt;Nová „message“ a uspořádání webu&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#nova-message-a-usporadani-webu" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ačkoliv mělo jít původně o pracovní portál, podtitulek junior.guru je „Průvodce programováním pro samouky“. Analogií v reálném světě je &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonely_Planet"&gt;Lonely Planet&lt;/a&gt;. Zprvu byla struktura jednoduchá: Nauč se, získej praxi, najdi si práci. Jedna, dva, tři. Pak jsem doplnil &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/candidate-handbook/"&gt;příručku&lt;/a&gt;, která tak nějak patří do hledání práce, ale tak nějak jí v menu vlastně překáží ty samotné inzeráty. Jenže ty mi mají vydělávat peníze, takže překáží záměrně. A aby nestačilo, že úvodní stránka nefunguje na prodej inzerátů, po přidání příručky bylo zřejmé, že tam pro ni není žádné dobré místo, ačkoliv je velmi důležitá. S proměnou junior.guru v klub je najednou vše jasnější.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Úvodní stránka bude lidem vysvětlovat, že jde o &lt;strong&gt;zájmový klub pro začátečníky&lt;/strong&gt;, do kterého se mohou přidat. Jednoduché, pochopitelné, s jasným tahem na bránu. Úplně vidím to velké tlačítko, které povede na platební bránu a &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/club/"&gt;seznam výhod, které na člověka v klubu čekají&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hned pod tím budou &lt;strong&gt;upoutávky na příručku s radami&lt;/strong&gt;. Obsah příručky bude stejně jako teď na webu zdarma a budu jej dál nadšeně vylepšovat a udržovat. Nebude to ale už „Příručka o hledání první práce v IT“. Bude to prostě „Příručka pro juniory“ a její součástí budou všechny obsahové stránky, které nyní na webu jsou: &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/learn/"&gt;Nauč se&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/practice/"&gt;získej praxi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/candidate-handbook/"&gt;najdi si práci&lt;/a&gt;. Příručka bude rozložená do více stránek, bude hezky strukturovaná, budou na ní loga firem. Ta jsou nyní jen na jedné stránce, v budoucnu by se to vše sjednotilo. Pokud bych to dokázal nějak vyrobit, mohlo by jít celou příručku i stáhnout jako přehlednou knihu třeba do Kindle nebo do PDF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jako doplněk bude na webu &lt;strong&gt;pracovní portál&lt;/strong&gt;. Upozorní na něj třetí segment úvodní stránky, a to tak, že některé nabídky přímo zobrazí a tím bude hned lákat k prokliku. Bude tam jasné, velké, pulzující tlačítko na zadání pracovní nabídky. Dobře, to přeháním, pulzující by asi být nemuselo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strukturu webu budou odrážet nejen tři sekce hlavní stránky, ale i hlavní menu, kde budou tři odkazy: Příručka, Práce, Klub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mvp"&gt;MVP&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#mvp" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krásně jsem se zasnil, ale to, co jsem právě popsal, nemohu v žádném případě hned realizovat. Všechno musím dělat postupně a sledovat, jestli to dává smysl a zda lidé vůbec mají o klub zájem. Pokusil jsem se osekat nutné změny na absolutní minimum a vypadl mi z toho tento &lt;em&gt;minimal viable product&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Založím Discord server a připravím v něm všechno na spuštění. Místnosti, uvítání, pravidla.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vytvořím pravidla chování, aby s nimi mohli souhlasit už i první (neplatící) členové.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Najdu prvních zhruba 30 lidí, které do klubu pozvu v předstihu a dám jim čestné členství. S nimi rozproudím diskuze a připravím klub na to, aby do něj mohli přijít první platící členové. Taky mi to pomůže s vytvořením prodejní stránky, protože už budu moci použít nějaké reálné snímky obrazovky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vytvořím prodejní stránku. Zatím bude cílit pouze na juniory, nabídku pro firmy dořeším později.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vymyslím způsob, jak za členství budou lidé platit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nechám si u právníků zhotovit obchodní podmínky, které berou ohled na zvolenou platební metodu a pravidla chování.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V době vydání tohoto článku &lt;strong&gt;jsem teprve v bodě číslo čtyři&lt;/strong&gt;, o bodu pět mám zatím jen hrubou představu a bod šest je v řešení. Snažím se klub rozjet s minimálním programováním a jiným zdržováním, takže počítám s tím, že prvotní platby budu částečně procesovat klidně i ručně. Myslel jsem si, že pro pravidla chování vytvořím stránku na webu, ale zjistil jsem, že ničemu nevadí, když jsou zatím jen v Google dokumentu. Pro firmy chci do budoucna nějaký ceník vytvořit, ale zatím se budu s nabídkou soustředit na jednotlivce a s firmami se hodlám bavit spíš napřímo, abych lépe pochopil jejich potřeby. Původně jsem myslel, že přebuduji i hlavní stránku junior.guru a dokonce jsem s tím už i začal, ale pak mi došlo, že to je zbytečné, že zatím stačí vytvořit &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/club/"&gt;/club/&lt;/a&gt;. Jakmile na stránce byly potřebné informace, dal jsem ji už i do &lt;a href="https://us3.campaign-archive.com/?u=7d3f89ef9b2ed953ddf4ff5f6&amp;amp;id=db2af6d08e"&gt;prosincového newsletteru&lt;/a&gt;, ačkoliv na ní v té době byly místo snímků obrazovky jen &lt;a href="https://placekitten.com/"&gt;fotky koček&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tento článek jsem psal několik dní&lt;/strong&gt; a zapadá do všeho tak, že lidem, kteří junior.guru delší dobu sledují, transparentně vysvětlí celý &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/pivot-startup"&gt;&lt;em&gt;pivot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a zároveň klubu dodá nějakou další úvodní publicitu ještě před spuštěním. Tím, že jasně vysvětluji své záměry do budoucna, zvyšuji šanci, že se mi nějaká firma sama ozve s nabídkou spolupráce. Tlačítko „Přidej se“ sice není napojeno na platební bránu, protože zatím nemám ani ty obchodní podmínky a nic prodávat nemohu, ale sleduje, jaký je zájem. Když na něj někdo klikne, odešle se &lt;em&gt;event&lt;/em&gt; do Google Analytics a já vidím, že se někomu myšlenka klubu líbila natolik, že kliknul, nebo že byl aspoň dostatečně zvědavý. Je to ovšem jen taková metrika pro radost, protože jsem rozhodnutý klub jednoznačně spustit bez ohledu na to, jaký o něj bude teď zájem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zpetna-vazba"&gt;Zpětná vazba&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#zpetna-vazba" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Než jsem se pustil do realizace, ptal jsem se dva týdny lidí a firem, co si o mém nápadu myslí. Reakce byly různé, ale vyhodnotil jsem to tak, že &lt;strong&gt;převažovala pozitivní odezva&lt;/strong&gt;. Nelze si brát všechny reakce příliš k srdci, protože lidé komentovali jen nějakou abstraktní ideu, kterou jsem se jim snažil předat v pár větách, ale i tak to bylo poučné. Jsem zvědavý, jak bude svět reagovat na konkrétní realizaci a jestli toto bude ta věc, která z junior.guru nakonec udělá funkční byznys, nebo zda se mám těšit ještě na mnohá další dobrodružství.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kód junior.guru je &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/junior.guru/"&gt;otevřený&lt;/a&gt; a číst si ho může kdokoliv. Týdenní poznámky o tom, jak pracuji na junior.guru, které každý týden vycházejí na tomto blogu, jsem zvyklý psát velmi otevřeně. Tento článek na tuto otevřenost navazuje a &lt;strong&gt;nechává vás nahlédnout do nejniternějších zákoutí toho, jak uvažuji nad svým podnikáním&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transparentnost chce odvahu a dá spoustu práce. Nejen že jsem psaním tohoto nekonečného článku strávil hodiny času, které jsem mohl věnovat něčemu jinému, ale jeho vydáním se vystavuji nejrůznějším možným nebezpečím. Jsem zranitelný a dělám zranitelným i své podnikání. Co když si to přečte můj zákazník a nebude se mu v článku něco líbit? Co když jsem něco formuloval necitlivě? Co když se mi zkušení podnikatelé vysmějí, že vůbec nevím, co dělám? Co když si to přečte konkurence a předběhne mě v něčem nebo zaútočí na nějakou slabinu, kterou jsem odkryl? Co když to celé lidi pochopí úplně jinak, než jsem to myslel?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenže takhle bychom se nikam nedostali. Každý by se bál otevřít svůj kód, podělit se o nápad, prodiskutovat byznys plán. Já opravdu nevím, co dělám, a neváhám to přiznat. Nevím co dělám, ale snažím vytvořit něco, co mě bude bavit, co pomůže druhým, a celé to dělám tak, jak to v daný moment nejlépe umím. Myslím, že nikdo ve skutečnosti neví, co dělá, akorát to mnozí umí dobře skrývat a působit sebevědomě. &lt;strong&gt;Já jsem se rozhodl, že bude jednodušší, když nic předstírat nebudu.&lt;/strong&gt; Zpětně se mi to vždy vyplatilo, tak snad se to vyplatí i teď.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Budu rád, pokud mi na tuto velkou otočku dáte zpětnou vazbu a pokud lidem o &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/club/"&gt;klubu&lt;/a&gt; řeknete. A nejraději samozřejmě budu, když se potom stanete i jeho členy :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category></entry><entry><title>Týdenní poznámky #32: Sláva na HN, přípravy na spuštění</title><link href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/tydenni-poznamky-32-slava-na-hn-pripravy-na-spusteni/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-01-08T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-01-08T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Honza Javorek</name></author><id>tag:honzajavorek.cz,2021-01-08:/blog/tydenni-poznamky-32-slava-na-hn-pripravy-na-spusteni/</id><summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utekly nějaké ty týdny (19.12. — 8.1.) a já &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/tydenni-poznamky-31-novy-pocitac-a-novy-produkt/"&gt;stejně jako před Vánoci&lt;/a&gt; sepisuji, co jsem dělal a co zajímavého jsem se naučil.

&lt;p&gt;Ke konci roku jsem si vzal dovolenou a svátky strávil bez JG a bez poznámek. Tyto poznámky shrnují vše, co se za tu dobu událo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="spusteni"&gt;Spuštění&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#spusteni" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jak jsem avizoval v předchozích poznámkách, chystám &lt;em&gt;pivot&lt;/em&gt; JG, tedy otočku v tom, jakým způsobem funguje a jak vydělává peníze. Co se mi v tomto směru povedlo udělat?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="zasek-a-praseni-kodu"&gt;Zásek a prasení kódu&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#zasek-a-praseni-kodu" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I když už jsem měl docela jasno v tom, co mám dělat a jaké konkrétní kroky musím udělat, byl jsem dost zaseklý a hodně jsem před svátky prokrastinoval. Přišlo mi, že jde o dost změn a hodně práce. Že musím vše rozvrtat a změnit. Povedlo se mi ale potřebný objem prací nakonec ještě víc osekat a uvědomit si, které kroky jsou opravdu jen ty nejvíc nezbytné, a na těch jsem začal postupně pracovat. S produktivitou mi nakonec nejspíš pomohl i oddech přes Vánoce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myslel jsem například, že musím komplet předělat úvodní stránku a menu. To mě hrozně zaseklo. Cítil jsem tíhu a komplexitu toho úkolu, koukal jsem do editoru, ale hrozně to drhlo. Když jsem to nechal být a rozhodl jsem se, že stačí zatím jen přidat jedinou novou stránku, hned to šlo líp. Nové věci se dají vyrobit mnohem snadněji a rychleji, než když se člověk musí rýpat ve starých věcech, kde mu různé předpoklady z minulosti házejí klacky pod nohy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Člověk si na začátku myslí, jak je všechno jednoduché a jasné. Že nemá šanci vytvořit si nějaký technický dluh, ale pak zjistí, že musí postupně měnit hromadu věcí spolu s tím, jak lépe rozumí tomu, co se snaží udělat a jak funguje byznys, do kterého se pustil. Začne iterovat a najednou kouká, že to je jako kdyby stál na dvorku s nějakou dřevěnou bednou na hezkém trávníku, ale rozhodoval se, kam se s ní otočí a kam ji ponese. A vždycky když se na místě otočí a rozhoduje, tak ten trávník pod sebou rozryje a když to takhle chvíli dělá, má pod sebou rozryté bahno, do kterého se propadá. No a nejhorší je ten pocit, že dokud nevím, kudy vyrazit, tak to prostě nesmím řešit, musím přešlapovat v tom blátě. Nemá smysl kultivovat trávník, který za měsíc můžu zase rozrýt, nebo na kterém tu bednu možná nechám ležet na vždy, když zjistím, že nakonec nemá smysl ji vůbec někam nosit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="krok-za-krokem-ke-spusteni"&gt;Krok za krokem ke spuštění&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#krok-za-krokem-ke-spusteni" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dokončil jsem &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/club/"&gt;stránku, která na novou věc upozorňuje&lt;/a&gt;. Jak si můžete přečíst, jedná se o &lt;strong&gt;klub pro začátečníky&lt;/strong&gt;. Celou tuto středu a čtvrtek jsem strávil psaním dlouhého článku, který objasní veškeré detaily ohledně toho, jak jsem se rozhodoval a proč klub spouštím. Bude obsahovat bilanci JG za rok 2020, a to včetně finančních výsledků a plánů do budoucna. Článek je od včera hotový. Vykopírovaný do Google Docs má 14 stran. Teď ho nechávám přečíst prvních pár lidí a vydám ho v pondělí. Počítám s tím, že díky tomu se o nové věci doví zase o trochu lidí víc. Dokud se ale za klub nedá zaplatit, nechci kolem toho zatím dělat nějakou velkou "mediální smršť". Co jsem za poslední týdny ve věci spuštění klubu udělal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dokončil jsem již zmíněnou stránku s nabídkou a vysvětlením, co klub je a proč je dobré se do něj přidat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pro firmy je nabídka záměrně jen někde ve FAQ a formou "napište mi na e-mail", soustředím se v této fázi především na juniory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na tlačítku "Přidej se" mám Google Analytics event, který mi dá vědět, pokud na něj někdo klikne. Díky tomu mohu aspoň přibližně sledovat, jaký je o klub zájem, i když ještě není spuštěný.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vytvářel jsem pro klub náplň, všechno nastavoval, snažil se pozvat a zapojit první lidi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sice jsem od toho už jednou upouštěl, ale rozhodl jsem se pro baťovské ceny končící na devítku, protože prostě fungují. Fungují i na mě. A hlavně mi umožňují dát to "za stovku" a zároveň si nenápadně vzít devět korun navíc, kterými zaplatím transakční poplatky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zkoumal jsem, jak udělat placení. Přečetl jsem si, &lt;a href="https://www.gopay.com/blog/7-veci-ktere-pri-vyberu-platebni-brany-malokdo-vi-a-pritom-maji-cenu-zlata/"&gt;jak vybrat platební bránu&lt;/a&gt;. Přečetl jsem si &lt;a href="https://www.gopay.com/blog/velke-srovnani-platebnich-bran/"&gt;srovnání&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1346440783189204992"&gt;Chyběl mi tam Stripe&lt;/a&gt;. Vybral jsem &lt;a href="https://stripe.com/"&gt;Stripe&lt;/a&gt; :) Ale do detailu promyšlené to zatím ještě nemám.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zkoumal jsem, jestli nepoužít nějakou hotovou službu pro správu členů. Našel jsem &lt;a href="https://upgrade.chat/"&gt;Upgrade.Chat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://launchpass.com/"&gt;LaunchPass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://memberful.com/"&gt;Memberful&lt;/a&gt;. Zeptal jsem se tweetem, jestli někdo nemá nějaké zkušenosti, ale bez odpovědi. Akorát mi do soukromých zpráv napsal někdo z LaunchPass, že jsou nejlepší a že bychom si určitě měli zavolat. Já je přitom původně hned vyřadil, protože mi přišlo, že na stránkách nemají ani kontakt na firmu. Zjistil jsem, že Memberful patří pod Patreon. Udělal jsem si tabulku, kde jsem se snažil propočítat, kolik co stojí a jakou marži si která služba bere, ale je to celkem zamotané (pevná sazba a procento z transakce) a je to výdaj navíc ještě k poplatku platební brány. Nakonec jsem se rozhodl, že zkusím nejdřív vymyslet nějaké co nejprimitivnější řešení, které bude třeba jeden skript a spousta manuální práce, než se budu pouštět do něčeho hotového, co přidá další poplatky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Abych zjistil, jaké nejprimitivnější řešení zvládnu udělat, studoval jsem &lt;a href="https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/"&gt;discord.py&lt;/a&gt; a pokoušel se napsat svého prvního &lt;a href="https://discord.com/"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt; bota. Budu nejspíš potřebovat stáhnout seznam členů a ten pak nějak propojit s daty ve Stripe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upoutávku na klub jsem dal už i do &lt;a href="https://us3.campaign-archive.com/?u=7d3f89ef9b2ed953ddf4ff5f6&amp;amp;id=db2af6d08e"&gt;prosincového newsletteru&lt;/a&gt;, i když jsem v té době ještě neměl ani dokončenou onu výše zmiňovanou stránku. Místo snímků obrazovky tam byly ještě &lt;a href="https://placekitten.com/"&gt;obrázky kočiček&lt;/a&gt;. No ale co, kočičky nebrání tomu, abych něco už začal pomalu spouštět, že? Newsletter šel 300 lidem, zhruba 150 to otevřelo, 23 lidí se prokliklo na klub. Nebylo to tam jako nějaký prominentní odkaz, spíš vespodu jako tip co se chystá, takže to je asi OK. Event spustili dva lidi. To je z 23 konverze skoro 9 % :) Po několika dnech jsem newsletter zkusil poslat ještě jednou lidem, kteří jej napoprvé neotevřeli. To už byly kočky pryč. Ale výsledky z tohoto jsem ještě ani neměl čas nijak vyhodnotit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Možná se mi povedlo domluvit nějakou pilotní spolupráci se vzdělávací institucí, ale uvidíme. Pokud by to fungovalo, možná by mi to ukázalo cestu k tomu, jak mám novou věc nabízet firmám zabývajícím se vzděláváním juniorů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kočky jsem vyměnil za snímky obrazovky. Aby vypadaly dobře a byly co nejjednodušší a co nejlépe ilustrující, hrál jsem si s nimi v GIMPu jeden celý den.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dnes jsem si hodinu volal s právničkou ohledně obchodních podmínek a zpracování osobních údajů. Super domluva, příští týden bych měl mít první verzi. Bez obchodních podmínek nemůžu spustit prodej.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rukou jsem nakreslil, následně vyfotil a &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/cartoonist"&gt;v počítači upravil&lt;/a&gt; novou ikonu s "mluvícími bublinami". Tu jsem potom použil, když jsem všude na webu JG dnes změnil odkazy tak, aby místo na FB skupinu mířily na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/club/"&gt;stránku o klubu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Před svátky jsem &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/i-bought-apple-silicon"&gt;napsal článek o tom, proč jsem si koupil nový Apple Silicon s M1 procesorem&lt;/a&gt;, a jaké jsou mé první dojmy. Odkaz na něj byl už v minulých poznámkách. Vydaný byl už v onen pátek, kdy poznámky vyšly, ale chtěl jsem ho začít propagovat až v pondělí, protože přes víkend bývá český internet mrtvý. Pod významnějšími články na blogu mívám odkazy na Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, nebo HackerNews, kde lidé mohou článek komentovat, protože jinak tady komentáře není jak přidat. Abych to měl připravené na pondělí, dal jsem už během onoho pátku odkaz na HackerNews a nalinkoval to z blogu. Stalo se, co jsem vůbec nečekal. Můj článek vystoupal na druhé místo přední stránky HackerNews a docela dlouho se tam držel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="HN" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/hackernews.jpg"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Začali mi psát kamarádi ze všech koutů světa, že mě vidí na HackerNews. Návštěvnost udělala docela slušný zub:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="HN Google Analytics" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/hn-analytics2.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
Celkem přišlo zhruba 15 000 lidí. Den, kdy jich přišlo nejvíc, zkreslil graf návštěvnosti natolik, že i 600 lidí za den se stalo jen malou tečkou někde na dně.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blog mám na GitHub Pages a jsou to statické stránky, takže &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdot_effect"&gt;Slashdot efekt&lt;/a&gt; mě netrápil. Užil jsem si svou chvilku slávy, chvíli &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25472370"&gt;diskutoval s lidmi na HN&lt;/a&gt; a potom to pominulo a byly Vánoce. Nejlepší reakce ze všech byla &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/klokane/status/1340958232584531969"&gt;tahle&lt;/a&gt;. Bylo hezké něco takového zažít, ale protože to není poprvé, co se mi něco podobného stalo, věděl jsem, že do pár dní po mě už neštěkne ani pes. O to víc mě překvapilo, když mi po několika dnech z ničeho nic přišel Google Alert na moje jméno! &lt;a href="https://www.lupa.cz/clanky/nefunkcni-cileni-na-facebooku-nejlepsi-viralni-videa-roku-2020-a-nejvice-vydelavajici-celebrity-na-youtube/"&gt;Zmínili mě na Lupě&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="Lupa" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/lupa-apple.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nikdy by mě nenapadlo, že věta "Honza Javorek si koupil [název počítače]" jednou bude zářit na Lupě. Tímto jsem se oficiálně stal celebritou! Akorát nevím, jak se to dělá. Jestli bych teď měl vydávat TZ, když si třeba koupím nové tenisky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kdybych měl posoudit, proč byl článek na HN tak úspěšný, tak bych řekl, že to nebylo ani tak díky kvalitě obsahu, ale prostě proto, že to bylo o Apple Silicon, který je teď hype, a protože jsem titulek formuloval způsobem, který je mezi lidmi na HN dlouhodobě oblíbený. Článek jsem sice psal několik hodin, ale nedával jsem si nějak extra záležet. Prostě jsem jakoby "pro kámoše" sepsal, proč jsem si koupil M1 a jak se mi to líbí, protože se mě na to dost lidí ptalo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/pyvec/jechova/pull/22"&gt;Opravil jsem Jechovou&lt;/a&gt;, bota, který organizátory pražského Pyva upozorňuje, že by měli organizovat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na schůzi výboru Pyvce jsme &lt;a href="https://github.com/pyvec/money/issues?q=is%3Aissue"&gt;schválili nějaké granty&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V rámci nastavování nového počítače jsem se koukal na nějaká &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W--_EOzdTHk"&gt;videa&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://realpython.com/python-development-visual-studio-code/"&gt;články&lt;/a&gt; o tom, jak si mám správně nastavit VS Code pro Python. Našel jsem i pěkný &lt;a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-macos.pdf"&gt;tahák na klávesové zkratky&lt;/a&gt;. Potom jsem to všechno přes svátky zapomněl a VS Code pořád používám jen jako takový lepší psací stroj.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během svátků yablko vydal &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEYnF7G7KXI"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;, které navazuje na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/candidate-handbook/"&gt;příručku&lt;/a&gt;. Láska!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Měl jsem videohovor se zakladatelkami &lt;a href="https://cybermagnolia.com/"&gt;CyberMagnolia&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cybermagnolia"&gt;@cybermagnolia&lt;/a&gt; na Twitteru) a předal jim v hodinovém skoro-monologu všechny rozumy, které mě napadly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jirichlebus.cz/"&gt;Jirka Chlebus&lt;/a&gt; mi dal vánoční dárek v podobě &lt;a href="https://juniorguru.visualbook.pro/"&gt;Visualbooku pro JG&lt;/a&gt;. Je k tomu i &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXA_DUFQbko"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;. Láska! Hned jsem to využil, když jsem nastavoval branding ve Stripe. Zatím jsem to nestihl nahodit přímo na JG, ale jak to udělám, ještě k tomu něco napíšu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hraní &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/236850/Europa_Universalis_IV/"&gt;EU4&lt;/a&gt; a čtení &lt;a href="https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/zahranici/tady-je-zivot-jen-stezi-predstavitelny-16-pribehu-rozvraceny/r~be9329fa3f8a11eba6f6ac1f6b220ee8/"&gt;tohoto seriálu&lt;/a&gt; mě přes svátky přivedlo na myšlenku, že mě asi baví geopolitika. Spojují se v tom dějiny, zeměpis a politika, což jsou všechno věci, které mě dost baví. Začal jsem sledovat &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/"&gt;/r/geopolitics&lt;/a&gt; a slintal třeba nad &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/knehdg/the_black_sea_battle_the_hotspot_of_2021/"&gt;tímto rozborem&lt;/a&gt;. Myslím, že je to silná konkurence pro architekturu, kterou jsem populárně-naučně sledoval několik posledních let, hlavně prostřednictvím Adama Gebriana (&lt;a href="https://www.mall.tv/gebrian-prekvapive-stavby"&gt;Překvapivé stavby&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.televizeseznam.cz/porad/gebrianvs"&gt;Gebrian VS&lt;/a&gt;) a &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/Archwars"&gt;Archwars&lt;/a&gt;. Dal jsem si dokonce do seznamu k přečtení dvě knihy (&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43697674-v-zajet-geografie"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30901158-uspo-d-n-sv-ta?ac=1&amp;amp;from_search=true&amp;amp;qid=JHYsHUMrpt&amp;amp;rank=1"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;), které samozřejmě nikdy přečíst nezvládnu, ale na mém GoodReads mohou vyjadřovat mou novou platonickou touhu po geopolitickém vzdělání.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obdivoval jsem nový &lt;a href="https://www.fakturoid.cz/almanach"&gt;Podnikatelský almanach&lt;/a&gt; na Fakturoidu.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pokud byste čistě náhodou měli dojem, že jste oproti mě za uplynulý týden vůbec nic nestihli, tak mám pro vás skvělou zprávu! V klidu se na ten dojem &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/neni-to-zavod/"&gt;můžete vykašlat&lt;/a&gt;. Není zač! Jo a vzhledem k aktuální situaci se mi teď líbilo ještě i tohle:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="why-i-bought-new-computer"&gt;Why I bought new computer&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#why-i-bought-new-computer" title="Permanent link to this heading"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My computer's display started slowly dying this year, suffering from gradually more and more serious &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbR2VhHLuW0"&gt;ghosting&lt;/a&gt;. By November it was so bad that I could barely read any letters after an hour or two of using the machine. It's MacBook 12" early 2015, which I bought a few years ago, second hand, refurbished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I know, &lt;em&gt;refurbished&lt;/em&gt; should mean that the computer was used as a sample machine somewhere, e.g. in an Apple Store. When they didn't need it anymore, it got checked for defects and sold for a cheaper price as a second hand product in a very good shape. My theory is that the computer was almost unused by the time I've bought it, but perhaps it was open with the display shining all the time in the shop, so durability of the pixels suffered a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, in addition to that, the machine's performance is a total potato these days. I have always appreciated its portability (size and weight of a magazine) and silence (has no fan), but I've spent most of this year at home, so I didn't care about portability, and the world got more bloated, so the minimum requirements for a smooth user experience are higher than in 2015. So by the summer 2020 I found myself wishing a new machine, and it just happened that Apple was about to release something with the new processors. I decided to wait, because I thought that (at the time) the latest machines would get cheaper if Apple releases something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-i-decided-to-buy-apple-silicon"&gt;How I decided to buy Apple Silicon&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#how-i-decided-to-buy-apple-silicon" title="Permanent link to this heading"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the first reviews were out, I waited for some more, but then it was just obvious this is a big change, a revolutionary machine, which is going to destroy the consumer market. I've enjoyed the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://singhkays.com/blog/apple-silicon-m1-black-magic/"&gt;Apple Silicon M1: Black. Magic. Fuckery.&lt;/a&gt; - compilation of various first impressions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/yeah-apples-m1-macbook-pro-is-powerful-but-its-the-battery-life-that-will-blow-you-away/"&gt;Yeah, Apple’s M1 MacBook Pro is powerful, but it’s the battery life that will blow you away&lt;/a&gt; - general review&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://debugger.medium.com/why-is-apples-m1-chip-so-fast-3262b158cba2"&gt;Why Is Apple’s M1 Chip So Fast?&lt;/a&gt; - how they made it and why competition won't be able to compete&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamesallworth.medium.com/intels-disruption-is-now-complete-d4fa771f0f2c"&gt;Intel’s Disruption is Now Complete&lt;/a&gt; - how Intel failed the same way it won in the beginning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, I decided I'll buy the new Apple Silicon M1 MacBook Air, because it doesn't make sense to go for anything older if I plan to have the new computer for as many years as possible going forward. It's not &lt;em&gt;cheap&lt;/em&gt; cheap, but it's still huge performance for a reasonable price. Honestly, I'm surprised I happen to be buying a freshly released Mac announced just a few weeks ago, when so far I've been buying only second-hand Apple hardware, but it just felt like it makes sense to do this, all things considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided I don't need more RAM than 8 GB, because nobody from the first reviewers managed to give the RAM a hard time. It seemed to me it's a different beast altogether and it doesn't make sense to just compare numbers and say that more is better. Apple allows you to buy a computer with more than 8 GB RAM, but I think it's just a trap how to satisfy and charge those who don't believe the reviews and just want more RAM whatever it takes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also decided I want 512 GB drive, as I'm used to that size and I didn't want to downgrade. Also, I had serious capacity problems with my 16 GB iPhone SE and my wife still has serious capacity problems with her 128 GB old Air, so I really wanted to avoid that in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided I don't mind that Docker or any kind of virtualization isn't supported (yet), because I don't use it. I'm self-employed solo enterpreneur now and Docker or Kubernetes play no role in my dev stack, also I use no virtual machines, nothing like that. If I was about to get a regular job somewhere, I assume they'd provide me a dedicated work computer. Also, I think &lt;a href="https://www.docker.com/blog/download-and-try-the-tech-preview-of-docker-desktop-for-m1/"&gt;it's gonna be resolved soon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="first-impressions"&gt;First impressions&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#first-impressions" title="Permanent link to this heading"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Air arrived this Tuesday, so as of writing this article, I work on it for 4 days. To be honest, upgrading from a years old machine with a dying display and a potato performance, to this shiny new beast, is… It's unbelievable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change in responsivity is really significant and I totally love it. I don't think I've ever used anything faster. With my potato machine I got used to going to bloated websites from my phone, as it felt that iPhone X can deal with them much better, but now the phone feels slow. &lt;a href="https://isapplesiliconready.com/"&gt;The optimized apps&lt;/a&gt; are super snappy. Safari runs smooth and fast like crazy. Firefox the same. Spotify, Slack, Discord, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, all the annoying bloated websites, which I used to hate so much for the past months, now run like if they were the most optimized websites on the internet. Honestly, I have problems to grasp the speed by my brain. It's just too much of a difference compared to my previous experience. It's like riding on a sloth and then suddenly switching to a super sonic rocket. I feel like I click on a tab in my browser and it happens instantly, and then it takes billion milliseconds until my brain realizes the action has been already performed and I can proceed to whatever else I wanted to do. I can now actually say when something needs network, because everything else is super fast. Whenever there's the slightiest lag, it's because network is involved, and because my network is slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to go with clean installation, so I didn't do any kind of smart restore from backup or anything like that. Just setting up the new system and moving my files, installing a few programs, like in the old days. Thanks to fast USBs and SSDs on both the computers and my external drive, moving the data was very fast, took just a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't upgrade to Catalina with my old laptop, because I wanted to play my 32bit Steam games, so macOS Big Sur is a quite a change for me now. A lot of setting up in the beginning, but all quite straightforward. A few surprises, such as zsh being the default shell in macOS now (change by &lt;code&gt;chsh -s /bin/bash&lt;/code&gt;). Finally I can set Finder to sort by name AND have folders at the top, at the same time. For me as a person who switched to macOS from other systems, it has always felt so silly that this wasn't possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="touchid"&gt;TouchID&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#touchid" title="Permanent link to this heading"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having TouchID as part of the computer is a nice surprise. As a person who has sweaty hands all the time, I didn't believe it's gonna work. But it's actually able to read my fingers without any problems. The iPhone SE couldn't deal with my fingers. It was a source of a lot of frustrations and one of a few major reasons why I switched to iPhone X in Feb 2020, which has FaceID (only if the pandemics didn't bring face masks right after that).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's very comfortable to use TouchID to login to the operating system, to 1Password, or to confirm a purchase in App Store (although that had to be first set up somewhere deep in the System Preferences, bah). Opening 1Password with a single finger touch is definitely a major productivity win for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="battery"&gt;Battery&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#battery" title="Permanent link to this heading"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday I tested the battery. 9am I unplugged the computer from electricity with 100% battery, and it started complaning about power only around 10pm. That's 13 hours. That said, during that day, I did mostly internet stuff, perhaps played some music, had 1 hour long call over MS Teams, 1 hour long call over Google Meet, and from 7pm to 10pm I attended an online meetup over Zoom. Before I connected to the meetup at 7pm, it still had almost 30 % battery left. Of course, no fan sound, as the machine has no fan, and it was only lukewarm between the keyboard and the display, cold everywhere else. Amazing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="games"&gt;Games&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#games" title="Permanent link to this heading"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Black Friday I bought &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/435150/Divinity_Original_Sin_2__Definitive_Edition/"&gt;Divinity: Original Sin 2&lt;/a&gt;, but it would crash on my machine. On the Apple Silicon Air, even though I run the game through Rosetta 2, I've put all the sliders in the performance settings to the highest positions, and it runs so smooth that when moving the game camera I actually experience problems to get my head around so many details happening on my screen. It's beautiful. Of course, the machine makes no sound, as it has no fan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;a href="https://applesilicongames.com/"&gt;list of games which are optimized&lt;/a&gt;, but I just installed Steam using Rosetta 2, downloaded the games I wanted through it, and didn't bother further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="setup"&gt;Setup&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#setup" title="Permanent link to this heading"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="homebrew"&gt;Homebrew&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#homebrew" title="Permanent link to this heading"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting up and figuring up Homebrew was a major drag, especially because my connection isn't very fast and initializing Homebrew downloads a lot of stuff over git, so it's endless. Before I found out the ideal configuration, I had to do it several times. I don't like Apple Store very much, so I only use it for installing apps which are not available as Homebrew casks, e.g. &lt;a href="https://sindresorhus.com/lungo"&gt;Lungo&lt;/a&gt;. I install everything else using Homebrew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homebrew suggests using it through Rosetta 2 (translation layer), which is fine, but I wanted to be able to also install apps which are already native to Apple Silicon. People post &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv2ylxro7rM"&gt;tutorials on how to have two Homebrew installations side by side&lt;/a&gt;, but it still took me some time to figure everyhting out. My setup after some trial and error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't bother installing CLI apps natively. &lt;a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/7857"&gt;It's a mess now&lt;/a&gt; and you'll only run into issues. Unless you want to help the Homebrew team with debugging, of course.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I ended up having the default Homebrew installed through Rosetta 2, and I install everything with it, both CLI and GUI apps,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;except GUI &lt;a href="https://isapplesiliconready.com/"&gt;apps which are already optimized for the new Macs&lt;/a&gt;, such as Firefox, Spotify, VS Code, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I follow the common advice on how to install Rosetta 2 Homebrew and how to install the native one. I won't repeat the many already existing tutorials:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv2ylxro7rM"&gt;Install Homebrew Natively on an Apple Silicon M1 Mac&lt;/a&gt; (see also comments)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://soffes.blog/homebrew-on-apple-silicon"&gt;Homebrew on Apple Silicon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/mikelxc/Workarounds-for-ARM-mac"&gt;Workarounds for ARM-based Apple-Silicon Mac&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The specifics of my setup are that I have this in my &lt;code&gt;.bash_profile&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;PATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"/usr/local/sbin:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$PATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Rosetta 2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"  # ARM (native)&lt;/span&gt;

brew-arm&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nv"&gt;HOMEBREW_NO_ENV_FILTERING&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; /opt/homebrew/bin/brew &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$@&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

brew&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  arch -x86_64 /usr/local/bin/brew &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$@&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I want to install an optimized GUI app, I can use &lt;code&gt;brew-arm install firefox&lt;/code&gt;. For anything else, I use &lt;code&gt;brew&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;HOMEBREW_NO_ENV_FILTERING=1&lt;/code&gt; is needed because I had some issues with the native Homebrew finding Git in the path. Maybe it was because I messed up with my setup too much, but whatever the reason, this has helped. I don't install CLI apps with the native Homebrew, so I don't have it in the &lt;code&gt;$PATH&lt;/code&gt;. I had issues with the binaries and various other things stepping on each other's toes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have this handy bash function for upgrading stuff, which allows me not to forget about something. With this I only need to type &lt;code&gt;upgrade&lt;/code&gt; to my terminal from time to time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;upgrade&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"[brew update, upgrade]"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  brew update &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  brew upgrade &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"[brew-arm update, upgrade]"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  brew-arm update &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  brew-arm upgrade
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id="vs-code"&gt;VS Code&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#vs-code" title="Permanent link to this heading"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visual Studio Code is now optimized for Apple Silicon, or at least I was able to install it by &lt;code&gt;brew-arm install visual-studio-code&lt;/code&gt; and it works and it's snappy. I hated that app on my last laptop, it was very slow and bloated, and I've been considering switching to something else. Now I don't care enough to see whether it's actually optimized or not, it's faster than my brain and that's quite enough. Unlike the other GUI apps I have, this one I want to have accessible from the terminal. It has a simple solution though, I just needed to &lt;a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_alternative-manual-instructions"&gt;follow the official tutorial&lt;/a&gt; and put this to my &lt;code&gt;.bash_profile&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;PATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$PATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;:/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/bin"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id="python"&gt;Python&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#python" title="Permanent link to this heading"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Homebrew over Rosetta 2, installing Python 3 works just fine. It might work natively too, but as I mentioned, I decided not to mess with that yet. I usually also have &lt;code&gt;pipenv&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;poetry&lt;/code&gt; installed globally, and over past years, by various trials and errors, I ended up installing those two by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ pip3 install --user poetry pipenv
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it's necessary to put this into my &lt;code&gt;.bash_profile&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# pipenv, poetry&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;PATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;python3 -m site --user-base&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/bin:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$PATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I upgrade those two regulary whenever I upgrade Homebrew, so I lied to you, my function for upgrading actually looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;upgrade&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"[brew update, upgrade]"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  brew update &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  brew upgrade &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"[brew-arm update, upgrade]"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  brew-arm update &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  brew-arm upgrade &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"[pipenv, poetry]"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  pip3 install --user pipenv poetry --upgrade
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate it when new Python version gets released, Homebrew automatically upgrades it, all my virtual environments with their symlinks get broken, and I have to re-create them one by one. I was lazy to solve that issue on my previous laptop, but with the new one I wanted to do it in a smarter way, managing Python installations by &lt;code&gt;pyenv&lt;/code&gt;. However, I got errors. It seems &lt;code&gt;pyenv&lt;/code&gt;, although installed with Rosetta 2, has issues to get Pythons to Apple Silicon. So I gave up on that for now and I'm going to do it the old way, using Homebrew-managed Python 3, and swearing every time it upgrades system-wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="terminal"&gt;Terminal&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#terminal" title="Permanent link to this heading"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I've been setting up Homebrew, I worked a lot with the built-in macOS terminal. It felt quite okay, and to be honest, I forgot the reasons why I've been using iTerm2. So I decided I'll give the built-in one a go and see whether it's sufficient for the stuff I do. So far it's okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="would-i-recommend-it"&gt;Would I recommend it?&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#would-i-recommend-it" title="Permanent link to this heading"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, yeah, sure, I'd totally recommend it. The computer is like a MIRACLE, especially if you upgrade from a potato machine. If nothing holds you back, like the lack of virtualization support, go for it. I hope it's gonna be this snappy for at least five years going forward. Given the little chance Intel or anyone else is going to keep up with this new level of performance, I believe this new laptop could be with me perhaps even longer, unless everyone else in the world buys it and developers start to create 10x bloated apps compared to today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secretly, of course, I wish other manufacturers to be able to keep up with Apple, against all the odds. I wish they rolled their sleeves and came up with something awesome, too. Because the last thing anyone needs is another market where Apple has monopoly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category></entry><entry><title>Týdenní poznámky #31: Nový počítač a nový produkt</title><link href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/tydenni-poznamky-31-novy-pocitac-a-novy-produkt/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-12-18T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-12-18T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Honza Javorek</name></author><id>tag:honzajavorek.cz,2020-12-18:/blog/tydenni-poznamky-31-novy-pocitac-a-novy-produkt/</id><summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utekl další týden (14.12. — 18.12.) a tak &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/tydenni-poznamky-30-boleni-hlavy/"&gt;stejně jako minule&lt;/a&gt; sepisuji, co jsem dělal a co zajímavého jsem se naučil.

Taky je to způsob, jak se sám doma nezbláznit a nepropadat pocitu, že je zase pátek a já jsem přitom nestihl nic udělat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="novy-produkt"&gt;Nový produkt&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#novy-produkt" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Přečetl jsem si všechen nashromážděný feedback na moje nápady znovu a znovu a probral vše s investorkou. Došlo mi, že jde vlastně o dva nezávislé produkty a že bych se teď teoreticky mohl rozhodnout udělat kterýkoliv z nich jako první. Napsal jsem si ke každému z produktů odrážky s tím nejmenším, co je potřeba pro jejich rozjetí v nějaké MVP verzi. Nakonec jsem se na dobrou radu rozhodl podle toho, že jeden produkt byl pro široké masy lidí a příjem z něj je &lt;a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/recurring-revenue-model/"&gt;monthly recurring revenue&lt;/a&gt;, kdežto druhý byl hodně úzce zacílený a platí se za něj spíš jednorázově. Vybral jsem ten pro masy, s MRR, i když je možná trochu složitější na rozjezd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poté jsem vysypal Trello kartičky z Todo sloupce a naházel tam ty odrážky, které vedou k MVP produktu. Následně jsem vymýšlel, jak zajistit, aby produkt chtěl někdo koupit. Je to totiž problém slepice a vejce, je potřeba, aby ho už někdo používal, aby byl užitečný i pro další lidi. Napadlo mě, že nějak chytře vyberu prvních 20-30 lidí s čestným přístupem zdarma, pokusné králíky. Na nich otestuji, jak to celé bude fungovat, a zároveň si pak už budu moci udělat screenshoty pro prodejní stránku nad reálným obsahem, který udělají. Následně jsem přemýšlel dál nad tím, jak by měla vypadat ta prodejní stránka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potom jsem se snažil vymyslet nějaký rozumný mix testovacích králíků, aby tam byli junioři, zkušenější lidi, i firmy, apod. Než jsem ale mohl kohokoliv nechat používat produkt, bylo potřeba zajistit, aby se k sobě chovali slušně, tzn. připravit pravidla chování (&lt;em&gt;Code of Conduct&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1338512096326201346"&gt;Ptal jsem se na Twitteru&lt;/a&gt;, něco zajímavého tam padlo, plus jsem pak hledal normálně Googlem nějaké české varianty, abych se mohl inspirovat. Přečetl jsem si, co o tom je na opensource.guide:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://opensource.guide/code-of-conduct/"&gt;Your Code of Conduct&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://opensource.guide/building-community/"&gt;Building Welcoming Communities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Měl jsem otevřených asi 20 různých CoC, ale nebyl jsem s nimi moc spokojený. Nakonec se mi zalíbil &lt;a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/"&gt;CoC od Djanga&lt;/a&gt;. Taky se mi líbilo &lt;a href="https://www.recurse.com/social-rules"&gt;tohle&lt;/a&gt;, ale to není CoC, spíš "měkká" doporučení, takže to třeba někdy někde použiju jindy. Napsal jsem tedy česká pravidla chování, z 90 % založená na těch od Djanga, a tak jak jsem je měl v Google Dokumentu, tak jsem je rovnou odkázal, ani jsem se neobtěžoval je přepisovat do HTML a dávat na web. Šetřím čas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pak už jsem jen poladil v novém produktu nějaké základní rozložení a uvítání lidí a začal jsem tam zvát první oběti mého experimentu. Zatím od všech dobrá odezva, od některých vyloženě nadšení. Nechám se ale překvapit, jaká bude odezva, až za to bude mít někdo platit :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teď musím vyřešit obchodní podmínky (poptal jsem u právníků, ale zatím mám jen jednu odpověď ze dvou), jak vyřeším placení, atd. Myslel jsem, že budu muset vytvořit prodejní stránku na tento nový produkt a k tomu ještě přepracovat homepage, ale pak mi došlo, že nemusím. Vytvořím jen tu prodejní stránku, napíšu tam beta, a ani na to nemusím dávat nikde zatím odkaz, homepage zůstane, jak je. Abych to sdílel na sociální sítě, na to mi stačí ta jediná nová stránka, kde bude produkt vysvětlený a půjde za něj zaplatit. Šetřím čas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cíl je, abych to byl schopný začít lidem nabízet během ledna a co nejdříve zjistil, jestli je o to zájem a jestli do toho mám dál investovat nějakou energii.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tento týden mi konečně dorazil nový počítač. Napsal jsem o tom &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/i-bought-apple-silicon"&gt;článek zvlášť&lt;/a&gt;. Nastavováním počítače jsem se zabýval velkou část úterý a pátku.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;O víkendu jsem se naučil dělat stop motion video. Byla to sranda.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Účastnil jsem se domlouvání ohledně vzniku materiálů na téma "trochu teoretičtější informatika pro juniory".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ve středu jsem měl call s jednou velkou firmou, která mě našla přes mou spolupráci s &lt;a href="https://karierko.cz/"&gt;Kariérko.cz&lt;/a&gt;. Líbilo se jim celé JG a v podstatě mi nadiktovali, co všechno si chtějí koupit :D Velká radost! V lednu bude faktura. Tož kdyby se takové sales cally děly častěji, to by mi vůbec nevadilo. Ani takový způsob sales, kdy jednám s už přesvědčeným zákazníkem a jen jej ujistím, že můj ceník chápou správně :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ve středu byl call výboru Pyvce. Nic velkého jsme myslím nevyřešili, akorát schválili jeden grant a probrali pár detailů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sehnal jsem účetního, který se nelekne Fakturoidu a který by mi mohl dělat daňové přiznání za rozumnou cenu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Byl jsem na pražském online Pyvu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Byl jsem na brněnském online Pyvu, měl jsem tam dva lightning talky a kecali jsme tam pak o všem možném dlouho do noci. Super.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Napsal jsem &lt;a href="https://github.com/pyvec/docs.pyvec.org/pull/89#issuecomment-747600730"&gt;tenhle komentář&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pokud byste čistě náhodou měli dojem, že jste oproti mě za uplynulý týden vůbec nic nestihli, tak mám pro vás skvělou zprávu! V klidu se na ten dojem &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/neni-to-zavod/"&gt;můžete vykašlat&lt;/a&gt;. Není zač!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="detox-od-kafe"&gt;Detox od kafe&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#detox-od-kafe" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minulé týdny jsem špatně usínal a přišlo mi, že se to jen zhoršuje. Tak jsem zkusil udělat to nejmenší, co můžu, abych to vyřešil - vysadil jsem kafe a čaj a tento týden se rozhodl udělat takový malý detox. Cílem bylo jen to, abych vyloučil vliv kofeinu na moje spaní. Místo kafe a čaje jsem pil jen &lt;a href="https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooibos"&gt;rooibos&lt;/a&gt;, který jsem se naučil pít v Namibii, a který nemá žádný kofein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenže, ač jsem dřív už kafe a čaj různě vysazoval a bez následků, tentokrát byly následky dost silné. Přesně jak se píše ve všech článcích, první den se nic neděje (ale zase jsem byl i tak poměrně nepoužitelný, protože jsem byl dost nevyspaný). Druhý a třetí den jsem sice vyspaný byl, ale bolela mě dost hlava a nemohl jsem u toho prakticky nic dělat. Posunul jsem i některé meetingy a na nic jsem nikomu neodpovídal. V úterý mě to vyřadilo z provozu úplně a poslalo do silné deprese i psychicky (tma, počasí, pandemie, pořád doma, stres z pivotu JG, atd.), ve středu mě to trápilo ještě půl dne. Než jsem si v úterý přečetl vše o bolení hlavy při vysazení kávy, tak to odpoledne prakticky přešlo a už nemělo moc smysl s tím nic dělat. Ale produktivní jsem ani tak moc nebyl, zbytek týdne jsem skoro strávil jen tím, že jsem doháněl výpadek v komunikaci.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud se opakované dodávání kofeinu náhle přeruší, dochází ke vzniku abstinenčních příznaků – ty se projevují právě bolestí hlavy, dále pak únavou, problémy s koncentrací, nevolností a dalšími symptomy podobnými migréně.&lt;br&gt;
-- &lt;a href="https://www.lecba-bolesti.cz/aktualne/migrena-reknete-ne-kofeinu-152"&gt;Migréna? Řekněte NE kofeinu!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jsem detoxový amatér a tak jsem nevěděl, že si to lidi kdyžtak plánují na víkend, nebo že bolest hlavy zmizí i při minimální dávce kávy. Můj cíl nebylo bojovat s nějakou závislostí na kávě, ale zlepšit spaní, takže jsem si klidně mohl dát každé ráno čtvrtinu kafe jen proto, abych se vyhnul bolení hlavy. No, příště budu vědět.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Každopádně jsem tedy asi tímto dospěl do fáze startupera biohackera, to je teď v Sillicon Valley prý hodně v módě.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mám nového &lt;a href="https://github.com/sponsors/honzajavorek/"&gt;podporovatele na GitHub Sponsors&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/lubosm"&gt;Luboše&lt;/a&gt;! Díky moc!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aktualizoval jsem sekci &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/#appearances"&gt;Appearances&lt;/a&gt; na svém webu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;O víkendu jsem na blog napsal &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/lide-pro/"&gt;článek o Lidé PRO&lt;/a&gt;. Mám v poslední době krizi s psaním článků (kromě poznámek) a tento jsem se rozhodl napsat asi za hodinu a prostě hned publikovat, dokud byla myšlenka žhavá. Druhý den jsem ho ještě trochu ladil a text upravoval, ale jinak jsem asi s výsledkem celkem spokojen. Ohlasů nebylo moc, což nevadí, protože jsem tomu dal hodinu času. Kdybych se tomu věnoval víc a pak to nikoho nezajímalo, asi by mě to mrzelo 😀 Takhle jsem rád, že jsem konečně zas něco napsal, i když jen takový štěk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V pátek jsem napsal doporučení na LinkedIn své bývalé kolegyni &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dariagru/"&gt;Darii&lt;/a&gt;, která se rozhlíží po nových příležitostech. Byla to radost psát, protože Daria je fakt eso!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Když už jsem byl u toho, napsal jsem ještě jedno doporučení, ale nejsem si zatím jistý, jak s ním onen člověk naloží a jestli vlastně hledá práci, tak to tady zatím nebudu rozmazávat, třeba příště.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Byl jsem v kontaktu s různými firmami a lidmi ohledně pivotu JG. Různě jsem si s nimi psal nebo volal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Naplánoval jsem statusy na sociální sítě, včetně &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/tips-tricks-on-how-to-get-your-first-job-in-tech"&gt;handoutu z přednášky&lt;/a&gt;, na který jsem předtím zapomněl a tudíž se postne na sítě až někdy příští týden.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během bolení hlavy jsem pročetl &lt;a href="https://www.businessinfo.cz/navody/obchodni-podminky-ppbi/"&gt;celý tento několikadílný článek o obchodních podmínkách&lt;/a&gt;. Myslím, že to nebylo k ničemu příliš užitečné. Bolení hlavy to taky nezlepšilo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Už delší dobu pokukuju po &lt;a href="http://yablko.sk/"&gt;yablkovi&lt;/a&gt; a už jsem ho i doporučoval v &lt;a href="https://eepurl.com/gyG8Bb"&gt;newsletteru&lt;/a&gt;, ale chtěl jsem mu časem udělat i větší promo. To se tento týden hezky spojilo s tím bolením hlavy, protože jsem nemohl nic dělat a tak jsem si pustil &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mgrioodze8&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be"&gt;jeho kurz o Tailwindu&lt;/a&gt;, abych se dověděl, jak to vlastně funguje. Teď mám lepší představu, jak jeho videa vypadají, můžu ho s klidným srdcem doporučit, a zároveň jsem se naučil něco nového. Sice nevím, jestli to použiju přímo teď na JG, to asi ne, ale třeba v budoucnu jo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Myslím, že za chvíli budu videocally už absolvovat jenom v kšiltovce, tak jak to dělají Amíci, když se stydí za ranní háro. Objednal jsem se k holičce, ale termín měla až za sto miliónů let.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vytipoval jsem si a přidal lidi na LinkedIn z různých cílovek, které mě zajímají.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rozjíždím jednu spolupráci s větší firmou, která mi na stole přistála díky spolupráci s jednou neziskovkou. &lt;em&gt;Not bad&lt;/em&gt;, uvidím, co z toho bude.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V rámci svého nového plánu jsem psal do dvou firem, se kterými jsem chtěl do budoucna vymyslet speciální spolupráci. Jedna vůbec neodepsala a z druhé mi přišel mail "jé nazdar, to je prdel", protože tam šéfuje můj bývalý spolužák z gymplu 😀 Jak jsem byl tento týden tak trochu mimo provoz, vůbec jsem si nevšiml, že kopíruju mail vedle jeho jména a hlavně, i kdyby tomu nešéfoval, nedošlo mi, že vlastně vím, že v té firmě dělá.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1335881823415570434?s=21"&gt;Ptal jsem se na Twitteru&lt;/a&gt; po dobrých materiálech o OOP pro začátečníky. Dostal jsem srdíčka a nějaké komentáře, ale materiály žádné. Asi chci něco, co nikdo nemá. Nechcete to někdo vytvořit? 😏&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hrál jsem si dál se &lt;a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/"&gt;Sphinxem&lt;/a&gt; a myšlenkou, jak by se do něj dala převést příručka. Po nějakém úvodním pokusu mi ale přišlo, že by to bylo hrozně moc práce. Sice bych mohl pak snadno vygenerovat PDF nebo ePub atd., ale popravdě to po mě vůbec nikdo nechce a musel bych všechno hodně ohýbat, aby to do toho Sphinxu šlo dát. Takže půjdu dál vlastní cestou a asi nechám i ty texty přímo v HTML. Je to prostě nejjednodušší a nejméně omezující v tom, co můžu v tom textu inline mít. Navíc bych musel udělat theme pro Sphinx, nemít úplně pod kontrolou markup v textu, a pak ještě Sphinx nějak zasadit do samotné webovky tak jak ji mám teď… No brr, ne, to zní jako spousta propáleného času.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taky mě dost omezuje displej, který kolabuje už po hodině dvou práce s něčím, co vyzařuje cokoliv světlého. Dark mode pomáhá, ale věci jako Google Docs, LinkedIn nebo jakákoliv stránka s bílým pozadím, to jsou prostě zabijáci, kteří mi okamžitě vysvítí pixely a pak už se na tom nedá skoro nic udělat, nevidím ani na písmenka v editoru, natož abych dokázal ladit barvy, to je úplné sci-fi. Objednaný Air s M1 by měl přijít někdy příští týden, už se nemůžu dočkat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zavolal jsem si s jedním šéfem firmy a druhý den s &lt;a href="http://encukou.cz/"&gt;Petrem&lt;/a&gt;, abychom probrali případný vznik nějakých materiálů na věci jako řadící algoritmy, složitost, apod.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zkusil jsem začít kódovat novou homepage JG v CSS, ale šlo mi to pomalu. Jednak roztříštěná pozornost, jednak polofunkční noťas. Taky si myslím, že se s tím moc patlám. Měl bych prostě do čtverečků nastřelit to hlavní, co chci sdělit, ať je to klidně hnusné, dát to ven, a až když uvidím, jestli to lidi chtějí, tak se s tím nějak víc vymalovávat. Jenže to je věčný boj u mě, donutit se &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/kolonizatori-a-spravci-kolonii/"&gt;kolonizovat&lt;/a&gt; a osekat vše nepodstatné, když je to potřeba.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jedno staré moudro praví, že než si něco člověk přeje, měl by se zamyslet nad tím, co by se mohlo stát, kdyby se to přání splnilo. Jinými slovy, neměl bych si přát něco, co si nejsem opravdu jistý, jestli chci, aby se opravdu stalo. No, přál jsem si memy, takže tady jsou. Tento týden jsou od různých autorů, kterým srdečně děkuji 😀 Kromě startupisty biohackera si teď připadám i jako influencer přes kávové mlýnky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kape z něj profesionální politický marketing, storytelling, patos. Všechny ty věci, které máme tak rádi z Čau lidi. Navíc super logo, s přesahem do gestikulace v reálném světě, kterou lze ve videu hned i vidět. Promyšlené! Chybí asi už jen štěňátko nebo hříbátko, ale třeba tam je, viděl jsem to jen jednou. Český Twitter (tzn. především novináři, politici a městská střední třída) to teď intenzivně hejtuje. Pro ukázku odcituju Apolenu Rychlíkovou (kterou čtu rád a jinak jí všechno intenzivně lajkuju):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p lang="cs" dir="ltr"&gt;Tak abyste si nemysleli, ja jsem to video videla taky. A fakt nechapu jednu vec: kdo si v 27 hraje na Havla a jeste si u toho mysli, ze to bude nekdo brat vazne? &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/vzdyckyproti?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#vzdyckyproti&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Apolena Rychlíková (@A_Rychlikova) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/A_Rychlikova/status/1334872101958914053?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 4, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p lang="cs" dir="ltr"&gt;Na me z toho dychl takovy mesiassky komplex, ze jsem zatouzila po strane s uprimnym nazvem Luzri.&lt;/p&gt;— Apolena Rychlíková (@A_Rychlikova) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/A_Rychlikova/status/1334876675432194048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 4, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nejsem politický komentátor ani politolog, ale soustředit se takto intenzivně na obsah toho, co se v tom videu dělá a říká, mi přijde krátkozraké. Mě zajímá víc ten &lt;em&gt;druhý plán&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poznámka: Věta, která má vzorec "nejsem XYZ, ale", je samozřejmě už sama o sobě důvodem číst cokoliv, co přijde potom, s popkornem v ruce. Já jsem k tomu navíc programátor, a ti jak známo až příliš často sežrali veškerou moudrost světa a vyjadřují se fundovaně ke všemu, co se hýbe i nehýbe, takže čekám, že si to v reakcích pěkně slíznu. Ale zpět k tomu, co chci říct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jednak mě zajímá, jak to video vzniklo. Je to podle mě z hlediska marketingu zcela profesionální práce. Nic takového jsem za poslední roky neviděl od žádné jiné politické strany kromě ANO. Že měl tohle celkem profesionálně pořešené Milion chvilek, to chápu, měli na to peníze. Kdo ale udělal toto video? Babiš na to má peníze, Milion chvilek na to má peníze, ale kdo dal peníze této vznikající straně? Případně kdo se rozhodl, že jim bude dělat marketing zadarmo? Věřím, že v případě spolků založených na ideálech a nadšení, jako je Milion chvilek, může být &lt;em&gt;pro bono&lt;/em&gt; práce upřímná, ale v politice podle mě nic úplně zadarmo nikdy není. O tom bych si chtěl číst, ne o tom, že nemají program. Z reakcí na tento článek:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p lang="cs" dir="ltr"&gt;Na některé z otázek není těžké dohledat odpověď. A je to pak celé napínavější. Například roli manažera hnutí dělá člověk, který organizoval mj. pár IT konferencí, českých komunit a teď kvůli tomu odešel z Googlu.&lt;/p&gt;— Martin Hassman (@hassmanm) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hassmanm/status/1335355980406775808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 5, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;No a jednak jsem s tímto videem začal Mikulášovi věřit. Ne, fakt ho volit nebudu, ale začal jsem mu věřit, že by mohl někoho oslovit. Mikuláš totiž tvrdí, že chce přetáhnout voliče Babišovi. Přišlo mi, že ti si jej zapamatují jako &lt;em&gt;Chvilkaře&lt;/em&gt; a nebude u nich mít žádnou šanci. Z druhé strany zase dostával naloženo za to, že štěpí opozici, a že cokoliv vytvoří, nikdo stejně nebude mít důvod volit. Teď mi přijde, že to má nějakou naději na úspěch. Je to profesionálně udělané a je to totožný styl, s jakým přišel Babiš. O demonstracích je tam snad jen sekunda videa, a myslím, že je to tak schválně. Když vůbec neposlouchám, co se v tom videu říká, ale snažím se číst to, jaké pocity má navodit, vidím jak je každý záběr promyšlený. Přijde mi to strašně laciné a až béčkově vtipné, ale na Čau lidi jde vidět, že je dost lidí, na které tato forma funguje. Jsem si jistý, že to není nikdo z české Twitter bubliny, ale přijde mi, že někoho od Babiše by tím vlastně oslovit mohl. Někoho, na koho štěňátka a osobnosti fungují, kdo je z Babiše zklamaný, možná není jeho skalní příznivec. Takoví ti spíš od středu a ti, co ANO volí spíš od začátku jeho existence než lidi, které ANO později vzalo ČSSD a KSČM. Že to Mikuláš schytává od českého Twitteru, je vlastně signálem, že na to možná jde dobře. Protože jestli chce oslovit nějakou podskupinu voličů ANO, zákonitě neosloví bublinu z českého Twitteru.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ostatně, nikdy jsem nechápal takový ten nárazový jásot Twitteru nad osobnostmi, které občas vystoupily z davu a řekly nebo udělaly něco, co střední třídu zahřálo u srdíčka. Vždy zavládne nadšení a pochvaly a takové to "na to, ke komu se ten člověk hlásí, tak teď se ukázal, je to fakt borec! skoro náš člověk!" a přitom ti lidi ho ale nikdy v životě nepůjdou volit. Ať už je to Herman, Sobotka, Vystrčil, Hamáček… Něco udělají, vyslouží si vlnu lásky na Twitteru, ale nikdo z těch lidí, co ty tweety píšou, je pak volit nepůjde. Už jen proto, že ve skutečnosti většinou existuje důvod, proč jsou v nepřátelském táboře (mimo svůj hrdinský čin hlasují pro nesmysly, jdou na ruku Číně, mají úletové názory, jsou homofobové, apod.). Nechápu, k čemu je to dobré.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takže to, že teď Twitter Mikuláše hejtuje, vidím opravdu jako znamení, že to co dělá, není možná úplná blbost. Kdo se ptá na jejich program, tak podle mě ten projekt vůbec nepochopil. ANO nemá program dodnes, a je to fuk. Záleží jen a jen na tom, jak stranu vnímá vytyčená cílovka. Je jedno, co k tomu napíše přesvědčený volič Zelených, Pirátů, nebo Topky. Pokud se rozčilují, je to nakonec možná znamení, že pokud někomu Mikuláš ubere hlasy, tak spíš tomu ANO, a ne těmto stranám, na jejichž průměrného voliče štěňátka asi fungovat nebudou.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minář dělá to, co řekl, že se pokusí udělat. Jestli se mu to povede, netuším. Od novinářů čekám rozbory toho, jakou cílovku si vybral, a průzkum, jestli to na ni funguje. Chci číst o tom, kdo mu dělá profesionální kampaň a kde bere peníze. Ale místo toho všichni akorát řeší, jestli Mikuláš svým konáním zapadá do nadějí a ideálů, které si kdo do něj projektoval. Oddělte své sny od reality, odložte emoce do šuplíku a odkrývejte prosím &lt;em&gt;druhý plán&lt;/em&gt;. Díky!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has been a very fruitful session of Q&amp;amp;A at the end of the talk. Before start I shared a Google Document with the attendees, where they could ask questions by simply writing them down to a prepared list (anoymously, if they liked). I also encouraged them to share any notes there if they like, and I provided some links to stuff I'll be talking about. A handout I compiled from this collaborative effort follows. I also tried to provide short written answers for all of the questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Experiences with finding YOUR first job? :)&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; I started with a part-time job during high school. First I joined the company to seal envelopes (30 CZK/h), but then they learned I know some CSS and HTML, so they promoted me to a junior web designer (70 CZK/h).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Is it bad to have a “half build / project with bugs” project on my github?&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; It's not! I preach freedom of what one puts on their GitHub profile. I preach your GitHub profile is your playground and you should not feel ashamed to have anything you like there. If someone asks you about a project on your profile, tell them truth: It's unfinished, it's something I made years ago and would do differently now (explain why and how), it's something you've been only playing around, etc. You can use the "pinned repositories" feature to make some repositories more visible. You can use the "archive repository" feature to signal that something is an old project you don't pay attention to anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Is it ok to apply for a job, which is looking for a junior, but in the post it says at least 2years experience?&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; It's hard to say. Often even the companies don't know exactly what they want, and they're trying how experinced people they're able to get. I'd say that if you feel like you can compensate years of experience with good projects and attitude, you have nothing to lose if you try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Resources where to train solving technical tests/tasks?&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://junior.guru/candidate-handbook/#leetcode"&gt;junior.guru/candidate-handbook/#leetcode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Should you mention your education in your CV, even if it’s not IT-related?&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; I think yes. Definitely mention any university-level school, if you have it. If you used to be a doctor, mention it. Of course, it doesn't make much sense to list all the dentist certificates you collected, only a high-level overview of your education. Also it depends on the company you're trying to apply to. If you're applying to a company which focuses on software for hospitals, your healthcare education is actually super relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Despite the COVID-19 context, should we accept remote jobs as juniors? I guess it’s not the best at the beginning:-(&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; I've done some research and I asked both HR people and senior people about this. From the answers it seems that companies now hire even juniors remotely. Seniors claim it's not such an issue if people are able to communicate, jump on a quick call, and so on. The HR people were less amused, but had "what else can we do, it's the only way now, so we're trying to deal with it" attitude. As for whether it's the best start for the junior, I'd say it doesn't matter that much. Remotely joining a company, which is dedicated to help you grow, is much better than personally joining a company, which abandons you two days after onboarding and their seniors don't have time to answer your questions even though they sit next to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you have some experiences with online freelance jobs? How to become freelancer? Is Freelancing recommended for juniors?&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; I just wrote two new sections about it in my handbook:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://junior.guru/candidate-handbook/#freelancing"&gt;junior.guru/candidate-handbook/#freelancing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://junior.guru/candidate-handbook/#contracting"&gt;junior.guru/candidate-handbook/#contracting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; How Corona affected the job market? There are probably many seniors searching for job now - is it too bad? Do juniors still have some hope?&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; I still see junior jobs advertised and I see juniors getting jobs. I don't think it's much worse than before. Juniors do still have hope :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Should you accept an unpaid internship?&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Depends on what you get from it. I think people don't properly value what they get for free. Even though you're junior, you'll still get some work done and even if symbolically, I think you should be compensated. It really depends on the conditions. If you want to gain some practice on a real world project, you can also ask around in nonprofit communities and do &lt;em&gt;pro bono&lt;/em&gt; work, where your relationship, commitment, and compensation is very clear: you're a volunteer, you gain experience, you can stop or take a break any time, you make the world a better place. See also &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/candidate-handbook/#internships"&gt;junior.guru/candidate-handbook/#internships&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you know a well-done tutorial / (online) course to understand how GitHub works, please?!&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; I like the &lt;a href="https://opensource.guide/"&gt;opensource.guide&lt;/a&gt;, which gives you the high-level basics of what Open Source is and how it works. Then I'd recommend to get a friend who has some experience with Open Source and ask him to give you a primer. I think it's the easiest way, because this stuff is just too hard to read from a manual, but perhaps one day I'll stumble upon something good and I'll start recommending it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Are there in Brno some conferences, meets or anything else for practice english in IT?&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Is there a website or anything similar to Glassdoor which provides (IT) company reviews in Czech R. in regards to their pay, culture etc?&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://atmoskop.cz"&gt;atmoskop.cz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Which companies would you recommend in Brno for Junior tech jobs? Start up, smaller or bigger corporations?&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/region/brno/"&gt;junior.guru/jobs/region/brno/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; And which are the companies hiring juniors in Prague?&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/region/praha/"&gt;junior.guru/jobs/region/praha/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; You said that bigger companies are more comfortable for juniors but won’t we learn more in a small company?&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Each has it's pros and cons. Highly depends on your preferences and how adventurous you feel. See &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/candidate-handbook/#job-types"&gt;junior.guru/candidate-handbook/#job-types&lt;/a&gt; and the chapters below that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Is it appropriate to offer companies to work as an intern for free?&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Last time I checked it's borderline unpaid work (illegal), but as it's borderline, it happens to exist. I'd prefer if even interns are paid. In some countries I heard it's totaly normal that interns are not paid at all. See &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/candidate-handbook/#internships"&gt;junior.guru/candidate-handbook/#internships&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Is there a way to start with IT other than web development? It often feels to me like this is 90% of IT job market and everything, but maybe it’s just my “social bubble”. Maybe how I could get to something else?&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Web development is everywhere, because it's what the the world is currently excited about, and it's not so hard for newbies to start with it (unlike, I don't know, artificial intelligence?). There are other fields, where juniors come handy, perhaps less visible, but they do exist. Tech writers, SRE, DevOps, automation engineers, testers (developers of automated tests), data analysts, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; what is appropriate or recommended to add to a junior's github? For example are Pyladies homeworks appropriate? Or is it better to skip that, and upload more "serious" projects?&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; See previous question. I fight for the freedom to put anything you play with on your GitHub. If the question is about "what projects are good enough to serve as a show off during my job interview?", then PyLadies homeworks are okay for a start, but I'm afraid it won't suffice. Your own separate project, which you'll create, develop, play with, deploy, etc. is prefferable, as it clearly demonstrates what you can do on your own, what technologies you can tame, how you solve problems, what you're able to finish, how you can break down assignment into smaller tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Could it be said if it’s better for a junior to work for a company which has its own product vs for a company which is “hired” by other companies to create a project for them?&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Up to your preference, each has its pros and cons. See &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/candidate-handbook/#job-types"&gt;junior.guru/candidate-handbook/#job-types&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What is an appropriate salary range for a junior in Brno? What about Ostrava?&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; There's not enough good data to answer this precisely. The country average is around 30 000 CZK. See &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/candidate-handbook/#salary"&gt;junior.guru/candidate-handbook/#salary&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps also &lt;a href="https://www.cooljobs.eu/en?searchKeyword=&amp;amp;searchPlace=&amp;amp;all=1&amp;amp;ord=create_desc"&gt;cooljobs.eu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Same question for Prague (especially for a junior Data analyst)!&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; There's not enough good data to answer this precisely. The country average is around 30 000 CZK. See &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/candidate-handbook/#salary"&gt;junior.guru/candidate-handbook/#salary&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps also &lt;a href="https://www.cooljobs.eu/en?searchKeyword=&amp;amp;searchPlace=&amp;amp;all=1&amp;amp;ord=create_desc"&gt;cooljobs.eu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Start as a junior developer in an IT or non-IT company? In regard to learning opportunities and future progress.&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Similar to previous question. A non-IT company with an IT department is very similar to how a product company is arranged. See &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/candidate-handbook/#job-types"&gt;junior.guru/candidate-handbook/#job-types&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Which companies are the best teachers for juniors? In which company can a junior expect to learn best practices instead of learning to do things in the not so prefered way?&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Great question! I think even seniors with they would be able to answer this with some level of generalization. The truth is, there's no way how to know this with a system of some simple rules of thumb. This is what the interview process is for. You observe the company, look for red flags, company culture, attitude to teaching and mentoring, attitude to technologies, and then you decide, if it's the right place for you. In the Czech Republic, you also have additional three more months of the probation period to figure this out. Do your homework and prepare good questions for the &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/candidate-handbook/#reverse-interview"&gt;reverse interview&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't edit the questions, they're authentic questions asked by the audience, with all their grammar imperfections. The answers I share in this handout can be different from those I gave during the live questions as they're answers I'm typing now, not a transcript of what I said week ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Nov/14/personal-data-warehouses/"&gt;Simon Willison&lt;/a&gt; for the Google Document idea. Big thanks to the organizers for inviting me and thanks everyone for having me. I didn't expect so many questions and I'm very excited about such massive response!

&lt;p&gt;Většinu času v tomto týdnu jsem strávil vymýšlením kam směřovat JG do budoucna:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V pondělí jsem popsal několik papírů, na kterých jsem si rozkreslil svou vizi až na úroveň nějakých jakoby wireframů. Večer jsem svůj nápad přednesl investorce, která z toho byla celkem paf. Spíš než v dobrém smyslu paf ji takový veletoč překvapil a řekla, že to asi dává smysl, ale musí nad tím ještě přemýšlet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V úterý i ve středu jsem se soustředil na praktické záležitosti. Jak funguje &lt;a href="https://stripe.com/en-cz"&gt;Stripe&lt;/a&gt;? Jak se dá integrovat s &lt;a href="https://www.fakturoid.cz/"&gt;Fakturoidem&lt;/a&gt;? Jaký je rozdíl mezi dokladem a fakturou? Co jsou obchodní podmínky? Můžu si je napsat sám, nebo potřebuji právníka? Kdo má hezky zpracované obchodní podmínky? (Odpověď: &lt;a href="https://www.fakturoid.cz/obchodni-podminky"&gt;třeba zrovna Fakturoid&lt;/a&gt;) Jak vyřešit některé nedomyšlené věci v mém plánu? Co přesně bude v nabídce? Jaký bude pricing? Jak se dá provést změna? Jak zmigrovat co mám, do něčeho, co chci mít? A tak dále. Večer jsem nemohl přestat na všechno myslet a živě jsem vše opět probíral s investorkou.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Od úterý do pátku jsem psal kamarádům, juniorům i firmám osobní zprávy, ve kterých jsem se jich ptal na názor na můj nápad. U kamarádů jsem kontroloval spíš jestli to není nějaký úplný úlet a jak to působí na nezúčastněného přihlížejícího, možná pro lepší odhad jakým směrem dělat marketing. Zpětná vazba od juniorů i firem mi stále ještě chodí a je to to nejlepší, co jsem mohl tento týden dělat. Je to výživné a skvělé, ve strašně moc ohledech. Nejdřív chodila zpětná vazba spíš typu "not amused", takže jsem hodně propadal splínu, jelikož jsem se na nápad hodně upnul a myslím, že jestli nevyřeší příjmovou stránku JG, tak už asi nic. Pak jsem se ale z deprese postupně dostával do mánie a zase do deprese a pak zase do mánie, podle toho, co chodilo za feedback, a pak se to nějak zprůměrovalo a já si uvědomil, že jsem na dobré cestě, základní myšlenka je dobrá, jen musím prostě doladit detaily tak, aby to pro všechny dávalo smysl. A taky lidi reagujou na hodně abstraktní věc, kterou se jim snažím sdělit v pár větách, nemají v hlavě přesně totéž, co si představuji já. Každopádně mluvit s juniory a firmami o tom, co by nejvíc ocenili, je fakt pecka a pro mě asi velký průlom. Vůbec nechápu, proč jsem to nedělal ve větší míře už dřív, ale asi prostě nebyla ta správná konstelace planet. Dříve jsem ověřoval původní hypotézu, která vznikla při založení JG, a říkal jsem si, že dokud to nedotáhnu, nemá smysl se moc ohlížet a řešit, jak si vedu nebo co si lidi myslí o tom, co dělám. Teď jsem na rozcestí a smysl to má perfektní. Snad na základě toho dokážu udělat ta správná rozhodnutí. Všechno mi teď ale do sebe zapadá jak puzzle, dílek do dílku, tak snad to není jen nějaká fata morgána.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mám novou &lt;a href="https://github.com/sponsors/honzajavorek/"&gt;podporovatelku na GitHub Sponsors&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/MartinaHytychova"&gt;Martinu&lt;/a&gt;! Díky moc!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přidání nových kapitol o OSVČ do příručky a jejich propagování na sociálních sítích mělo samé dobré ohlasy a vytvořilo mi v návštěvnosti velice slušný peak.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zkoušel jsem, jestli by mělo smysl příručku překlopit do mého oblíbeného &lt;a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/"&gt;Sphinxu&lt;/a&gt;. Jednak by to lépe zapadlo do mého plánu, jednak se z toho dají generovat věci jako .epub nebo .pdf. Zatím jsem se nerozhodl a nikam daleko se v tom nedostal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vyšlo video mé přednášky pro brněnské Pyvo, takže jsem ještě dnes večer sepsal &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/tips-tricks-on-how-to-get-your-first-job-in-tech"&gt;handout tady na blog&lt;/a&gt; a příští týden ho nějak zpropaguju.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Posunul jsem zase o kousek blíž k existenci seznam členů Pyvce na &lt;a href="https://pyvec.org/"&gt;webu Pyvce&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/pyvec/docs.pyvec.org/pull/178"&gt;Update info regarding GDPR, privacy policy, and the public member roster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/pyvec/pyvec.org/pull/189"&gt;Fix key name, this makes the link invisible&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/pyvec/pyvec.org/pull/190"&gt;Přidání seznamu členů&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inicioval jsem, aby se na &lt;a href="https://python.cz/"&gt;python.cz&lt;/a&gt; konečně přidal odkaz na &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/yUbgArVAyF"&gt;český/slovenský Python Discord&lt;/a&gt;. Tu hlavní práci odvedl admin Discordu, já jen přicmrndával:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/pyvec/python.cz/pull/447"&gt;Upgrade Font Awesome to version 5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/pyvec/python.cz/pull/448"&gt;Add link to discord&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/pyvec/python.cz/pull/449"&gt;Reorder and update links&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mojeid.cz/cs/proc-mojeid/pristup-ke-sluzbam-verejne-spravy/"&gt;Nechal jsem si poslat klíčenku od MojeID&lt;/a&gt;, abych s ní mohl v budoucnu jednodušeji přistupovat ke státním webům a službám.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poslal jsem listopadový &lt;a href="http://eepurl.com/gyG8Bb"&gt;newsletter&lt;/a&gt; s nabídkami práce a novinkami na JG.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přidal jsem &lt;a href="https://www.femmepalette.com/"&gt;Femme Palette&lt;/a&gt; na JG do &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/practice/#mentors"&gt;sekce o mentorování&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nějaký pan Akash mi nabízel, že mi prodá doménu juniorguru.com. Chvíli jsme si psali. Navrhoval jsem $20, on $2000. Tak jsem řekl, že to je víc, než hodnota celého mého byznysu, a že bych se možná nechal ukecat na $200. On že $2000 je minimum a ať se mi daří. Já ji nepotřebuju, takže ne že mi ji někdo koupíte na Vánoce, to mi radši &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/donate/"&gt;pošlete ty peníze na účet&lt;/a&gt; :D&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sáhl jsem do úspor a koupil jsem si &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-air"&gt;ten nový Apple Air&lt;/a&gt;, abych konečně vyřešil svůj starý nestíhající počítač s odvařeným displejem. Těším se na doručení jak malé děcko. V dnešním doporučeném čtení najdete &lt;a href="https://debugger.medium.com/why-is-apples-m1-chip-so-fast-3262b158cba2"&gt;ještě jeden článek o M1&lt;/a&gt;, který se mi fakt líbil, ale snad už vás s tím jinak přestanu otravovat. Leda že by mi bouchl ten nový byznys model na JG a stal se ze mě youtuber: "Ahoj (úsměv), tady Horst Fuchs, nový video (lusknutí)"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zjistil jsem, že můj malý příruční aku Bosch krásně sedí na náš kávový mlýnek. Děkuji &lt;a href="https://github.com/vasekch"&gt;Vaškovi&lt;/a&gt;, že mi vnuknul tuto ideu a já to zkusil. Byť jsem to už dříve viděl u kávového guru &lt;a href="https://coreskill.tech/"&gt;Dana&lt;/a&gt;, nikdy jsem si nemyslel, že tak profesionální přípravu mohu provádět i u sebe doma, s nástroji, které mám. Dle mých informací dokonce můj aku sedí na mlýnek mnohem lépe, než Vaškův. Při přípravě kávy si teď připadám úplně stejně, jako když generuji RSS pomocí cronu v GitHub Actions. Už chybí jen něco někde přilepit izolepou, něco namazat, něco odpálit, a pak &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTWEh2mcdsg"&gt;odfrčet po vodní hladině na rakvi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tento týden jsem se především připravoval na přednášky a přednášel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dve-prednasky"&gt;Dvě přednášky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dve-prednasky" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeden bootcamp si se mnou už dřív na 25. 11. domluvil přednášku pro jejich studenty. Sice jsem se to snažil uhrát tak, aby se to třeba aspoň nahrálo a dalo na YouTube, protože nevím, jak moc mi dává smysl dělat přednášku pro ~10 lidí, a to ještě &lt;em&gt;pro bono&lt;/em&gt; v rámci placeného kurzu, ale nakonec jsem to prostě stejně přijal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shodou náhod se mi ale ozvali orgové &lt;a href="https://pyvo.cz/brno-pyvo/2020-11/"&gt;brněnského Pyva&lt;/a&gt; s tím, že budou mít 26. 11. sraz na téma práce v IT a jestli bych tam nechtěl mít přednášku. Tak jsem si řekl super, nebudu to připravovat pro 10 lidí, ale třeba aspoň pro 60, a jak znám brněnské pyvníky, určitě to i nahrají a dají na YouTube, takže to uvidí ještě víc lidí.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V pondělí jsem dělal jiné věci, v úterý jsem si přednášku připravil (nějakou osnovu jsem měl už vymyšlenou předem) a ještě večer jsem si ji trochu zkoušel. Abych se dostal do přednášecího módu, pustil jsem si skvělý &lt;a href="https://getpocket.com/redirect?&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsimonwillison.net%2F2020%2FNov%2F14%2Fpersonal-data-warehouses%2F&amp;amp;h=18e0b4bd3d0d398c9d8025395b30e4de757844ec6b2cfee9236153402e7d72cb"&gt;talk svého velkého vzoru Simona Willisona&lt;/a&gt;, od nějž jsem i odkoukal nápad s Google dokumentem, kam mohou lidé během přednášky klást dotazy a psát poznámky. Ve středu ráno jsem neměl čas na nic, něco jsme řešili na bytě s okny a potom jsem se nemohl odtrhnout od přemýšlení nad tím, co dál s JG, no a ve 13:00 už jsem měl přednášku pro bootcamp. A dopadlo to dobře!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zbytek dne už jsem ale pozornost neudržel. Musel jsem dál přemýšlet nad budoucností JG, byl jsem nervózní ze čtvrtečního talku, a prostě jsem se nějak zasekl. Takže jsem vymyslel, že budu pracovat na věcech, které s JG vůbec nesouvisí a pustil se do nějakých Open Source drobností. Ve čtvrtek jsem v tomto pokračoval a vyzkoušel si ještě jednou odpřednášet nanečisto talk, upravený pro Pyvo. Večer jsem se připojil, na srazu byla milá atmosféra, odvykládal jsem talk a pak mě ještě hodiny grilovali na dotazech :D Ke konci už jsem měl úplně vymluvený hlas. Připojilo se snad přes 50 lidí, takže celkem úspěch. Nahrané by to mělo být taky. Až bude záznam venku, zkusím to tady celé publikovat i se &lt;a href="https://speakerdeck.com/honzajavorek/tips-and-tricks-on-how-to-get-your-first-job-in-tech"&gt;slajdy&lt;/a&gt;, dotazy, poznámkami.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;První ohlasy jsou fajn. Myslím, že se to líbilo. Lidé se mě teď ptají kdy a kde bude nahrávka. (Odpověď: Někdy bude, nevím kdy, Pyvo dělají dobrovolníci, takže nechť na to mají tolik času, kolik potřebují.) První feedback, který jsem dostal, byl tento :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na začátku teda trochu depresivní, ale celkově moc pěkný no-nonsense talk!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tož, já prostě nebudu lidi vodit za nos, že na juniory všude čekají s otevřenou náručí a nebude to těžký, jako to dělají jiné nejmenované projekty a aktivity :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="co-dal-s-jg"&gt;Co dál s JG&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#co-dal-s-jg" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Během středy dopoledne jsem se pokusil na JG podívat trochu s odstupem a sepsal jsem si zhruba jednu stránku, takovou jako kdyby &lt;a href="https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zpr%C3%A1va_o_stavu_Unie"&gt;Zprávu o stavu Unie&lt;/a&gt;. Asi se to správně jmenuje jinak, nejsem profi podnikatel, ani nemám ekonomku :) Je to prostě rozbor toho, jakým způsobem JG vydělává peníze, kolik to je, jak se to daří nebo nedaří, jaké jsou vyhlídky a co se dá dělat dál.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="Plán listopad 2020" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/plan-listopad-2020.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nápady co dál by byly, ale chci to ještě důkladně probrat i se svou "investorkou" a nechat si to celkově projít hlavou, takže žádné akční závěry zatím nemám. Je to zatím spíš ve fázi návrhu, brainstormingu, atd. Pokud bych to napsal sem na blog, může to být bráno jako nějaké oficiální oznámení, takže sem nic psát nebudu. Novinky tohoto typu musím oznamovat koordinovaně a mít to pod kontrolou z hlediska marketingu. Potom sem ten report klidně hodím, nic tajného to v zásadě není.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blbý je, že jak jsem začal přemýšlet nad tímhle, nechtělo se mi pak dělat na JG takovou tu denodenní běžnou práci. Jako bych stáhl plachty a nechal lodičku stát na místě, dokud nebude jasné, kam pluju, a prostě se mi do té doby nechtělo ani vydrhnout palubu. Takže mi přišlo vhod, že tento týden jsem zabil přednáškami a vlastně jsem nic jiného ani moc dělat nemusel. I když teda bylo docela vtipné, že se mě v otázkách po každé z přednášek někdo zeptal, co plánuju s JG dělat dál nebo jak se tím hodlám živit :D a protože jsem příliš dobrá duše, neřekl jsem &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/donate/"&gt;běžte sem a pošlete peníze&lt;/a&gt;, ani jsem nedržel poker face, ale prostě jsem vždy řekl něco od srdíčka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V pondělí jsem konečně publikoval kapitoly o OSVČ a ty jsou nyní už součástí &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/candidate-handbook/"&gt;příručky&lt;/a&gt;. Budu je postupně propagovat na sociálních sítích.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jedna firma souhlasila s prodloužením svého loga na příručce o další tři měsíce. Juchů!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slíbil jsem, že na &lt;a href="https://karierko.cz/"&gt;Kariérko.cz&lt;/a&gt; dodám do konce roku článek.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zapomněl jsem minule napsat, že jsem strávil nějakou tu hodinku na callu s kamarádem, který se mě vyptával na všechno okolo API. Bylo to vlastně fajn, povídat si po dlouhé době o něčem jiném než o juniorech, ale zároveň jsem rád, že API už nedělám :D Poznámka: Pokud vůbec nevíte co API je, &lt;a href="https://cojeapi.cz/"&gt;věděl bych o jednom takovém fajném webu&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na Indie Hackers jsem si aktualizoval profil a zeptal se v diskusi na &lt;a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/resources-for-a-good-hearted-geek-to-boost-the-sales-skill-848b948313?commentId=-MMtZ0W-WtyuG_TNir4C"&gt;tipy jak se zlepšit v sales&lt;/a&gt;. Na základě toho a dalších doporučení od bráchy jsem si pořídil knihy &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4865.How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People"&gt;How to Win Friends &amp;amp; Influence People&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30357454-nikdy-ned-lej-kompromis-aneb-vyjedn-vej-tak-jako-by-ti-lo-o-ivot"&gt;Nikdy nedělej kompromis&lt;/a&gt;, které se chystám přečíst, myslím že zhruba do roku 2050 bych to mohl zvládnout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chtěl jsem sledovat &lt;a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/interviews/"&gt;interviews na Indie Hackers&lt;/a&gt;, ale nemají RSS. Existují nějaké aplikace, které jsou schopny udělat RSS i z běžné stránky. Jenže celý ten web je nějaká SPA frontendová šílenost, takže všechny ty věci si na tom vylámaly zuby, protože očekávají obyčejnou HTTP odpověď obsahující HTML. Dal jsem tomu pár minut kódění s tím, že to možná nebude tak těžké scrapnout - přece jen SPA je nad nějakým API, tak třeba by z něj to šly ty články nějak jednoduše vytáhnout a vygenerovat z toho XML. Většinou, když si myslím, že něco budu mít do hodiny hotové, tak mi to trvá přinejlepším půl dne, takže mě opravdu překvapilo, když jsem to měl hotové asi za 20 minut :D Celý skript má do 30 řádků a i s nastavením GitHub Actions, aby jednou za den vygenerovaly soubor, to zabralo asi hodinu práce. &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/ih-interviews"&gt;Repo zde&lt;/a&gt;. Vtip byl hlavně v tom, že jejich frontend se přímo dotazuje na službu &lt;a href="https://www.algolia.com/"&gt;Algolia&lt;/a&gt; a v kódu jsou vidět všechny klíče potřebné k připojení. Takže jsem si jen přečetl dokumentaci jak se Algolia používá z Pythonu a na třech řádcích jsem měl ve svém skriptu stejný výsledek vyhledávání, jako mají oni na webu. Pak už bylo potřeba jen naučit se s nějakou knihovnou na generování feedu. Poměrně náhodně jsem vybral &lt;a href="https://feedgen.kiesow.be/"&gt;feedgen&lt;/a&gt; a kopíroval příklady z jejich dokumentace tak dlouho, dokud to celé nezačalo nějak fungovat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Viděli jsme přes &lt;a href="https://mojekinolive.cz"&gt;Moje kino LIVE&lt;/a&gt; film &lt;a href="https://www.csfd.cz/film/811642-vikend-na-chate/komentare/"&gt;Víkend na chatě&lt;/a&gt;. Oboje velmi doporučuji. Moje kino LIVE funguje stejně, jako kdybyste šli do kina. Je to v konkrétní čas, lístky si koupíte přes Goout, dostanete privátní odkaz na streaming, tam jedou reklamy a upozornění (že si máte otevřít víno, ne že si máte vypnout mobil). Zároveň je tam chat, kde můžete kecat s dalšími účastníky kina. Pak se chat zavře a začne film. Tedy vlastně ne, objeví se nějaký režisér nebo prostě někdo, kdo má s filmem něco společného, a nejdříve vám o něm něco řekne. Pak začne film. Na konci se zase objeví chat a hraje kavárenský &lt;em&gt;noise&lt;/em&gt;, můžete se bavit s ostatními o filmu a je to teda dost sranda. Zvlášť v případě tak skvělého finského filmu o opilých třicátnících na chatě. Myslím, že to je věc, ke které Češi mají taky dost vztah :) i když určitě při sledování filmu neuškodí, pokud něco víte i o vztazích mezi Finy a Švédy, protože na chatě je i jeden Švéd a jsou z toho dost vtipné situace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na &lt;a href="https://pyvec.org/"&gt;web Pyvce&lt;/a&gt; přidali kluci z PyData na můj popud různá loga a informace o PyData. Asistoval jsem, aby se to všechno zamergovalo a dostalo ven.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na repozitáři nástroje pro nahrávání redirectů na ReadTheDocs, který jsem kdysi dávno splácal a hodil na PyPI, &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/rtd-redirects/pull/2"&gt;se objevil Pull Request&lt;/a&gt; od &lt;a href="https://github.com/VanDavv"&gt;Łukasze&lt;/a&gt;, který to zřejmě používá nebo chce použít! Já tedy zapomněl, že vůbec takový projekt mám, ale tím spíš je skvělé, že to pomáhá i někomu dalšímu. Dal jsem projekt trochu dopořádku, převedl z TravisCI na GitHub Actions, ze setup.py na Poetry, odstranil Semantic Release, které tam spíš jen překáželo, no a udělal jsem na tom PR review, poprosil o změny, pak zamergoval a vydal novou verzi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na &lt;a href="https://github.com/Frozen-Flask/Frozen-Flask/"&gt;Frozen-Flask&lt;/a&gt;, kde se mi nějak už dříve přihodilo, že jsem jedním ze dvou správců projektu, se objevil &lt;a href="https://github.com/jayaddison"&gt;James&lt;/a&gt; s Pull Requestem, takže jsem udělal reviews atd. To jej zřejmě motivovalo k dalším Pull Requestům, takže jsme chvíli dělali ping-pong s komentáři a Pull Requesty a Frozen-Flask teď hezky testuje a podporuje Python 2.7 i 3.9.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zjistil jsem, že &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/vietcodecz/"&gt;Viet Code&lt;/a&gt; se asi přejmenoval na &lt;a href="https://compeduo.cz/"&gt;Compeduo&lt;/a&gt;, takže jsem jim zkusil napsat ještě jeden e-mail, který nabízí spolupráci.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na web Pyvce jsem se pokusil &lt;a href="https://github.com/pyvec/pyvec.org/pull/188"&gt;přidat zásady zpracování osobních údajů&lt;/a&gt;, zatím bez zpětné vazby. Tajně doufám, že si toho nevšimne žádný právník.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zkoumal jsem opět nové M1 procesory od Applu a nové počítače, které vydali.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V pátek jsem zaznamenal zajímavou věc. Spadl mi robot na nabídky práce, protože se snažil scrapovat přes ruskou proxy a dostal stránku federální vlády, že přístup k těmto informacím je zakázán zákonem :D Opravil jsem to tak, aby se v takovém případě vybrala jiná proxy :) Snad mi &lt;a href="https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feder%C3%A1ln%C3%AD_slu%C5%BEba_bezpe%C4%8Dnosti"&gt;FSB&lt;/a&gt; nedá něco do čaje.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;V pondělí jsem si vzal dovolenou a udělali jsme si prodloužený víkend. Riskli jsme jízdu vlakem (jak lze vidět na počtu přečtených a sdílených článků na konci poznámek) a provětrali jsme se prací a výlety v přírodě u rodiny na Zlínsku, což bylo dost osvěžující. Tento pracovní týden měl tedy jen středu, čtvrtek a pátek. Nic velkolepého jsem tudíž neudělal a zkusím psaní poznámek vměstnat do 15 minut. Než se uvaří vajíčka na večeři. Třeba se to povede. Většinou je píšu víc jak hodinu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V průběhu středy jsem odpovídal na e-maily aj. zprávy od lidí, které jsem ignoroval během dovolené. Jak tu větu píšu, tak jsem si uvědomil, že některé pořád ještě ignoruji a měl bych jim odepsat 😱 Po obědě mi přišlo, že je venku příliš hezky na to, abych seděl doma, takže jsem se jel projet na kole 🤷‍♂️&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organizátoři brněnského Pyva se ozvali s tím, že už týden slibuju anotaci k přednášce, &lt;a href="https://pyvo.cz/brno-pyvo/2020-11/"&gt;tak jsem něco vyplodil&lt;/a&gt;. Bude to online, přijďte! Přednášku jsem ještě nezačal připravovat, to musím zvládnout příští týden.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Můj experimentální hlídač politických stran odchytil první zajímavou změnu. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1329347842587156480"&gt;LIST skončil.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odstranil jsem výrazné sekce v příručce, které prosily lidi o to, aby mi &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/donate/"&gt;přispěli&lt;/a&gt;. Měly nulovou konverzi, nikdo mi i přes velkou návštěvnost příručky nepřispěl, takže jsem si řekl, že se na to asi musí jinak a takhle tam jen zabírají místo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anketu o Discordu (viz minulé poznámky) jsem &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/junior.guru/permalink/494820874774858/"&gt;udělal i na Facebooku&lt;/a&gt;. Diskuse pod příspěvkem mě přesvědčila, že to mám asi fakt udělat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celý čtvrtek a pátek jsem pracoval na &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/junior.guru/pull/414"&gt;přepsání kapitol o OSVČ&lt;/a&gt;, které chci přidat do příručky (viz předminulé poznámky). Už mi to leze i ušima. Snažil jsem se zapracovat veškerou zpětnou vazbu a zároveň to pojmout i trochu jinak, aby text nebyl jen o tom, co za hrůzy na OSVČ všude číhá, ale poskytoval i nějaká konstruktivní řešení, pokud do toho člověk chce fakt jít. Snad už to v řádu jednotek dnů vydám.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V Europa Universalis IV. se mi podařilo vyřešit vzpouru Janičářů a konečně do své Osmanské říše anexovat Sýrii, která už mi přerůstala přes hlavu. Tím jsem vyřešil hromadu interních problémů a už mohu opět radostně ničit zbytek Evropy, Asie i Afriky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mezitím vším mě synovec na Duolingu předběhl v celkovém XP 🤨&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Koukal jsem na nové počítače. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heGYlDrrRMM"&gt;Mára pobavil&lt;/a&gt;, z komentářů: "10:25 Ten pocit když zjistíš, že si vyhodil 100 000 Kč do kanálu". &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FiloSottile/status/1329093320207859717"&gt;Tady Filippo Valsorda dokumentuje&lt;/a&gt;, co mu na nových Apple čipech funguje a co ne. Ještě mrknu na nějaká videa, ale kupovat staré Macy asi nedává smysl. Koupím nový Air a svůj současný MacBook 12" s odvařeným displejem si chvíli nechám jako zálohu, kdyby něco nejelo. Až tato doba pomine, nejspíš ho &lt;a href="https://www.nbservis.cz/vykup/"&gt;prodám na náhradní díly&lt;/a&gt;, jelikož displej měnit už nechci a s tímto je neprodejný i nedarovatelný.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 minut to nebylo, ale i ta půlhodina je asi dobrý výkon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="clanek-v-hn"&gt;Článek v HN&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#clanek-v-hn" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minulý týden vyšel na HN &lt;a href="https://byznys.ihned.cz/c1-66838170-jak-se-stat-programatorem-zeptali-jsme-se-firem-co-ma-clovek-umet-a-zjistili-kde-se-to-naucit-zdarma"&gt;článek o tom, jak se stát programátorem&lt;/a&gt;. Kamarád &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/milavot"&gt;Míla&lt;/a&gt; mě na to upozornil. Nebyla tam zmínka o JG, což mě zamrzelo, tak jsem napsal autorovi článku, zda by ho nedoplnil. Domluvili jsem se ale na tom, že bude lepší, když napíšu reakci jako názorový text. V pondělí jsem se na to hned vrhnul a celý den strávil psaním. V úterý jsme to doladili a odpoledne &lt;a href="https://nazory.ihned.cz/c7-66842510-o6u82-1feb79267e3aa75"&gt;to vyšlo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="Titulka" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/hn-home.jpg"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jako první si toho všiml kamarád &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomas_ehrlich"&gt;Tomáš&lt;/a&gt; a psal mi, že otevře noviny a hle, Javorek. Nečekal jsem, že to vyjde na titulce HN. Myslel jsem, že jako názorový text to bude zahrabané někde vpravo dole vedle Peroutky. Měl jsem takovou radost, že jsem text všude začal sdílet. Lidi mi to začali házet na hlavu, že je to za paywallem, tak mi kamarád s předplatným poslal link na odemčený článek a všechny statusy jsem upravil tak, aby tam byl tento nový link. Zaráželo mě, že jako autor článku nemám ještě na HN fotku, i když jsem ji posílal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Za hodinu nebo tak nějak mi odepsal editor HN, že je to vydáno a poslal mi samozřejmě i můj vlastní link na odemčený článek, který mohu sdílet :) A už jsem tam měl i fotku :) Prostě jsem to díky Tomášovi objevil moc brzo a radoval se z toho příliš brzo :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="LinkedIn" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/hn-linkedin.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Podle jejich sloupečku vpravo je článek ke dnešku čtvrtým nejčtenějším na HN, přečetlo si jej 16 840 lidí. Ještě včera byl třetí nejčtenější. Na titulce vydržel zhruba 1,5 dne, což jsem pozorováním toho, jak se propadávají jiné články, zjistil, že není úplně automatické/běžné. Lidi občas komentovali, že jsem mohl zmínit &lt;a href="https://imysleni.cz/informaticke-mysleni/co-je-informaticke-mysleni"&gt;informatické myšlení&lt;/a&gt; a diskutovali jsme, jak moc není potřeba ta matematika, ale jinak jsem se setkal výhradně se zcela pozitivními reakcemi typu "přesně tak to je, popsal jste to dobře".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Článek obsahuje odkazy na JG, takže z něj vede přímá návštěvnost na projekt. Protože shodou okolností vyšel měsíc po tom, co o mě vyšel &lt;a href="https://www.czechcrunch.cz/2020/10/boreni-mytu-a-uzitecne-rady-pro-kazdeho-zacatecnika-honza-javorek-vydava-prirucku-o-hledani-prvni-prace-v-it/"&gt;článek na CzechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;, dá se celkem hezky srovnat jejich dopad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="Návštěvnost" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/hn-analytics.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Editor mi poděkoval za spolupráci a napsal, že si všiml, &lt;a href="http://junior.guru/press"&gt;že vydávám i tiskové zprávy&lt;/a&gt;. Pokud bych prý nějaké do budoucna měl, mám je poslat. Což je vtipné, protože jsem myslel, že jsem přišel na to, že ta sekce je nakonec asi k ničemu a můžu ji klidně zrušit :D Tak ji asi teda rušit nebudu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Článek se zatím nepřetransformoval v konkrétní příjem. Možná bych toho chtěl moc a hned, možná to prostě jenom dělám blbě :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="roztristena-pozornost"&gt;Roztříštěná pozornost&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#roztristena-pozornost" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primárním cílem tohoto týdne bylo doladit nové kapitoly o OSVČ a přidat je do příručky. Když jsem se do toho chtěl v úterý ráno pustit, uvědomil jsem si, že kamarád &lt;a href="https://coreskill.tech/"&gt;Dan&lt;/a&gt;, od něhož jsem to review fakt chtěl, to ještě neokomentoval. Tak jsem jej pošťouchl a on s tím hned začal. Mezitím se ale přidali další. Ti, co komentovali dřív, začali reagovat na nové komentáře. Už byl skoro oběd a já jen koukal, jak to vlastně pořád nemůžu začít v tu chvíli dělat :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aby bylo jasno, nestěžuju si vůbec na své reviewers, moc si vážím toho, že se mi takto věnují a je super, že text prošli. Jen se to tak vtipně sešlo. Takže jsem práci na textu v úterý odložil. Jenže pak zase vyšel ten článek na HN a s ním nastala komunikační smršť, večer a skoro půlku dalšího dne jsem strávil na sociálních sítích. Poté na JG přišla nabídka práce od CzechInvestu, viz další odstavec, a na ní jsem pracoval do konce týdne. Takže kapitoly jsem vůbec nakonec neudělal :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="czechinvest"&gt;CzechInvest&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#czechinvest" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CzechInvest zadal na JG &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/3836983b9b25b1e06e45229e582a3988c5f2e32d3ada8d05240535ae/"&gt;fajn nabídku práce&lt;/a&gt;. Nebyla úplně juniorní, ale nechali si poradit, snížili jsme nároky a přepsali jsme to. Jenže!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když byla nabídka práce relevantní pro více měst, třeba pro Prahu i Brno, řešil jsem to doteď tak, že se "rozkopírovala" pro každé město. Občas to vypadalo blbě, ale jinak to bylo poměrně snadné řešení složitého problému. Jenže teď přišel CzechInvest s &lt;strong&gt;HOLD MY BEER&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CzechInvest má pobočku v každém krajském městě… můžeš mít zázemí v kterémkoliv z nich…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Můj Google Spreadsheet na to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Praha nebo Brno nebo České Budějovice nebo Hradec Králové nebo Jihlava nebo Karlovy Vary nebo Liberec nebo Olomouc nebo Ostrava nebo Pardubice nebo Plzeň nebo Ústí nad Labem nebo Zlín&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Můj web na to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="WTF" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/wtf.gif"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takže jsem čtvrtek a pátek překopával, jak se tohle na JG řeší. Teď může mít nabídka práce více lokací a podle nich se zobrazuje na hlavní stránce jen jednou, ale zároveň i na stránce pro každý relevantní region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skoro jsem se bál, že budu muset přidat model a používat takové ty věci jako cizí klíče a joiny, ale naštěstí to co potřebuju v Peewee v pohodě zvládne SQLite JSON field. Dokonce jde i hledat podle hodnot uložených do tohoto políčka, stačí akorát pochopit dokumentaci ke kryptickému &lt;a href="http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/sqlite_ext.html#JSONField.children"&gt;.children()&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/sqlite_ext.html#JSONField.tree"&gt;.tree()&lt;/a&gt;. Zobrazování lokací na webu jsem nějak narychlo doplácal, když je toho moc, tak se dělají tři tečky a na stránce inzerátu to teda vypadá dost hrozně, ale funguje to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ke konci týdne bylo takové nějaké programování příjemným zklidněním mé roztříštěné pozornosti. A pokud to tady čtou nějací junioři, &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/3836983b9b25b1e06e45229e582a3988c5f2e32d3ada8d05240535ae/"&gt;určitě na tu nabídku práce mrkněte&lt;/a&gt;, protože mi přijde dost fajn. Na webu &lt;a href="https://www.czechinvest.org/cz/Kariera/Kariera-v-CzechInvestu/Specialista-IT-Programator"&gt;mají mimochodem i seniornější nabídku&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domluvili jsme si spolupráci s &lt;a href="https://karierko.cz/"&gt;Kariérko.cz&lt;/a&gt;. Vtipné bylo, že jsem dostal instrukci "zavolejte mi mezi 15 a 16 hodinou" a já docela dlouho přemýšlel, jak mám zavolat, když nemám odkaz ani instrukce o jaký program půjde, než mi došlo, že si zavoláme klasicky přes telefon, bez videa :D&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1325698903648456707"&gt;Oslavil jsem pomyslně&lt;/a&gt; zhruba jeden rok existence JG. Se ženou jsme oslavili 10 let spolu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vybraným klientům z minulosti jsem jako poděkování, že dali JG šanci v prvním roce jeho existence, poslal slevu na vše, co se nachází na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/hire-juniors/"&gt;stránce pro firmy&lt;/a&gt;. Zatím bez konverze, ale platí to do konce listopadu. Cílem bylo připomenout se lidem, kteří možná JG v minulosti zkusili, když tam ještě nebyla taková návštěvnost, ale vyhodnotili jej jako nedostačující a už se k němu nevrátili.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;O víkendu pršelo a měl jsem chuť si něco jen tak naprogramovat, tak jsem vytvořil &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/czech-political-parties"&gt;"git scraper" rejstříku politických stran&lt;/a&gt;. Proč jsem něco takového dělal a na co je to dobré najdete v README a v tomto &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1325460171674574849"&gt;vlákně&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Měli jsme schůzi výboru &lt;a href="https://pyvec.org/"&gt;Pyvce&lt;/a&gt;. Po ní se mi už nechtělo pracovat na JG, tak jsem si řekl, že některé drobné úkoly můžu vlastně udělat hned. Přednesl jsem členům Pyvce způsob, jakým bychom mohli hlasovat v příštích volbách do výboru, prošel jsem Pull Requesty, poslal jsem mail všem členům se žádostí o souhlas publikovat jejich jméno na webu Pyvce. Potom se může na webu udělat veřejný seznam členů (bo jinak GDPR). A máme &lt;a href="https://docs.pyvec.org/operations/twitter.html"&gt;novou stránku v dokumentaci&lt;/a&gt;. Petr vylepšil &lt;a href="https://github.com/pyvec/jechova/"&gt;Jechovou&lt;/a&gt;, já asistoval s reviews.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Studoval jsem nové Apple počítače. Můj počítač má už zcela odvařený displej a výkonově nestíhá. Na tento Apple event jsem tedy čekal už několik měsíců. Buď že koupím to nové, nebo to poslední staré, pokud by se to zlevnilo. Rozhodnu se definitivně až vyjdou nějaké recenze těch nových, od smrtelníků. Jsem zvyklý si drahé věci kupovat na spoustu let a používat je, dokud se nerozpadnou na šroubky, takže chci vybrat něco pořádného.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V návaznosti na článek se mi ozval pán z konzultantské firmy. Volali jsme si a když jsem dnes pochopil, co vlastně asi přesně chce, navrhl jsem mu, že chce asi spíš &lt;a href="https://www.integromat.com/"&gt;Integromat&lt;/a&gt; než &lt;a href="https://python.cz/"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pohrávám si s myšlenkou, jestli by mělo smysl založit Discord chat a nahnat do něj co nejvíc juniorů, aby si spolu mohli povídat real time. &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/junior.guru/"&gt;FB skupina&lt;/a&gt; funguje zatím spíš jak můj newsletter než místo, kde by se lidi radili apod. Vlastně mi přijde, že je FB jako médium trochu mrtvý a odkázaný ke konzumování obsahu, ne k interakci. Lidi se navíc stydí do skupiny hodit nějaký post, znemožnit se otázkou… Přijde mi, že na chatu se lidi víc odvážou a komunikaci vnímají víc jako rovný s rovným. Zase se bojím, aby s tím nebylo moc práce (moderátorské, správcovské). Taky nevím, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1326112095323234304"&gt;jestli je Discord nejlepší volba&lt;/a&gt;, ale nic lepšího teď asi stejně není. Python Discord je třeba dost úspěšný, viz &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH26PuX3re0&amp;amp;feature=share"&gt;tahle "reklama"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pokud byste čistě náhodou měli dojem, že jste oproti mě za uplynulý týden vůbec nic nestihli, tak mám pro vás skvělou zprávu! V klidu se na ten dojem &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/neni-to-zavod/"&gt;můžete vykašlat&lt;/a&gt;. Není zač!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tento týden jsem se zabýval mnoha věcmi, ale tou nejdůležitější asi bylo napsání nových kapitol pro &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/candidate-handbook/"&gt;Příručku o hledání první práce v IT&lt;/a&gt;. To provázela i nějaká základní rešerše a jsem v kontaktu i s jednou osobou, která by mi možná poradila, jak se dá v IT přivydělat během péče o dítě. To ale možná bude i na celou další kapitolu. Ty dvě, co už mám připraveny, jsou o práci na volné noze a o práci "přes IČO", tedy kontraktorství a švarc systému. Psal jsem je celý čtvrtek a část pátku (přitom taková blbost, že). Jestliže máte k těmto tématům blízko a chtěli byste mi na to dát zpětnou vazbu, napište mi na &lt;a href="mailto:honza@junior.guru"&gt;honza@junior.guru&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dokončil jsem práci na scraperu nabídek práce z jednoho většího zdroje, který se scrapování brání (viz předešlé poznámky). Hlavní věc, kterou bylo potřeba vyřešit, byla nespolehlivost a nedostupnost proxy z &lt;a href="https://github.com/clarketm/proxy-list"&gt;proxy-list&lt;/a&gt;. Můj scraper ztratil spoustu času na timeoutech. Takže jsem hledal lepší zdroj těch proxy. &lt;a href="http://free-proxy.cz"&gt;free-proxy.cz&lt;/a&gt; vypadalo dobře, protože tam je i sloupec s dostupností a rychlostí proxy, ale záhy jsem zjistil, že ten web nemá žádné API a není snadno scrapovatelný (má relativně sofistikované ochrany, např. při detekci scrapingu odesílá reálně vypadající, ale nesmyslný obsah). Nakonec jsem skončil u stahování seznamu z &lt;a href="https://free-proxy-list.net/"&gt;free-proxy-list.net&lt;/a&gt;. Následně jednotlivé proxy hned zkouším a HEAD requestem na &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz"&gt;honzajavorek.cz&lt;/a&gt; (aby mě někdo nenařknul z toho, že mu &lt;a href="https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial_of_service"&gt;DoS&lt;/a&gt;uju web) testuju jejich dostupnost a rychlost. Když nasbírám 10 spolehlivých proxy, přestanu s tím. Samotný scraper pak díky tomu jede velmi rychle, vše funguje, a vystačí si s méně než deseti těmi proxy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upravil jsem u výše zmíněného scraperu i vyhledávané fráze. Měl jsem tam "software engineer", ale to nechytalo všechno, tak jsem přidal "developer" apod. Uvidíme, tohle se dá pak už ladit za pochodu, hlavně když to konečně nějak funguje.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dokončil jsem melouch pro kamaráda. Vyřešili jsme ještě deployment Python balíčku z privátního GitHub repozitáře na Heroku a bylo to. Řešení jsem &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/64645458/325365"&gt;dal na StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt;. Potěšilo: "Moc jsi nám pomohl, jsem naprosto spokojený. A máme krásné readme! Věřím, že si u tebe někdy objednám readme i na ostatních projektech :D" Dovedu si představit, že občasné psaní readme by mě jako melouch bavilo, takže pokud chcete hezčí readme k nějakému projektu nebo potřebujete napsat jinou podobnou menší dokumentaci, klidně mi napište :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pokud jste někdy potřebovali v GitHub Actions něco commitnout zpět do repozitáře, v &lt;a href="https://github.com/EndBug/add-and-commit/issues/56#issuecomment-720452435"&gt;tomto komentáři&lt;/a&gt; jsem se rozepsal o tom, jak to udělat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prošel jsem &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/learn/#covid19"&gt;sekci o koronaviru&lt;/a&gt;. Upravil jsem formulace zase zpět, aby nepoužívaly minulý čas, ale přítomný :) Taky jsem jasněji rozlišil, co se dělo na jaře a co je teď. Přidal jsem drobnou zmínku o Radůze. Odcitoval jsem Janu Večerkovou z &lt;a href="https://www.codingbootcamp.cz/"&gt;Coding Bootcamp Praha&lt;/a&gt;, ať mají radost. O bootcampu nic konkrétního nevím a neberte to jako moje doporučení, že je dobrý nebo že se vyplatí, ale přiznávám, že jsme v kontaktu a budu jejich studentům na konci listopadu něco říkat o JG. Nějaké jemné nezávislé spolupráci se nebráním, ale bootcampy aj. kurzy a workshopy zatím doporučovat nechci, protože nemám jak sám ověřit jejich kvalitu nad rámec toho, co o sobě řeknou sami v rámci svého marketingu. Pokud chtějí být na JG, &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/hire-juniors/#handbook"&gt;mohou si zaplatit logo na příručce&lt;/a&gt;, s tím není žádný problém.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Udělal jsem si malý "strategický plánek" jak bych mohl v blízké době udělat JG profitabilní. Veškeré sales zatím úspěšně prokrastinuji, ale tak to dál nejde. Musím do toho začít víc bušit. Taky jsem se v poslední době dost vykašlal na sociální sítě, takže na ty bych se měl vrátit alespoň s dvěma pravidelnými statusy týdně, aspoň takový "heartbeat", že JG stále žije. Musím se víc soustředit na LinkedIn, kde mám cílovku v podobě HR a firem. Chci přepracovat &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/hire-juniors/"&gt;stránku pro firmy&lt;/a&gt; a udělat z ní různé "landing pages", které by se objevovaly ve výsledcích vyhledávání a které bych mohl i cíleně firmám posílat, když je oslovím. Rozhodl jsem se více vyzdvihnout spojitost mezi diverzitou a juniory a přizpůsobit tomu nabídku firmám.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Naplánoval jsem tedy na týden dva dopředu nějaké statusy na sociální sítě.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zjistil jsem, že můj úžasný &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/monitoring-performance-with-lighthouse-and-circleci"&gt;Lighthouse skript&lt;/a&gt; občas spadne. Headless browser se kvůli něčemu nepřipojí apod. Věci, které se stanou náhodou a já je nijak neovlivním. Stalo se to už potřetí, zabudoval jsem tedy do skriptu nějakou &lt;em&gt;retry&lt;/em&gt; logiku.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protože sdíleli JG na všech svých sociálních sítích, přidal jsem mezi loga na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/hire-juniors/"&gt;stránce pro firmy&lt;/a&gt; i portál &lt;a href="https://navolnenoze.cz/"&gt;Na volné noze&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psal jsem si s hodně lidmi. Už v úvodu jsem zmínil, že jsem v kontaktu s jednou osobou ohledně péče o dítě a přivýdělku v IT. Napsal jsem ale i českému komunitnímu manažerovi v TopTalu, jestli jejich aktivity nemají i nějaký překryv s juniory, psal jsem si s juniorem, který se málem stal obětí švarc systému, psal jsem si s kamarádem &lt;a href="https://vuyisile.com/"&gt;Vuyem&lt;/a&gt;, který je junior a dělá freelancera v Zimbabwe, psal jsem si s několika kamarády, kteří jsou aktivní freelanceři nebo kontraktoři, a tak dále. Zkouším navázat nějakou spolupráci s &lt;a href="https://karierko.cz"&gt;Kariérko.cz&lt;/a&gt; a jednou aktivitou, která řeší diverzitu a inkluzi při náboru do firem. Jsem také v kontaktu s redaktorem Hospodářských Novin a možná spolu upečeme a vydáme mou reakci na článek, který tam tento týden vyšel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Po večerech hraju &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/236850/Europa_Universalis_IV/"&gt;Europu Universalis 4&lt;/a&gt; a nemůžu se od toho vůbec odtrhnout. Se ou láskou k historii a geografii je pro mě tenhle "map staring simulator" v téhle době "jakože lockdownu" úplná závislost. Pokud příště poznámky nebudou, nebo v nich bude už jen nějaký seznam států, které se staly vazaly mé rozsáhlé Osmanské říše, tak se asi nedá nic dělat. Vnímám to jako nezvratný proces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jo a za chvíli jdu teda pro zpestření hrát &lt;a href="https://www.tmou.cz/101/"&gt;Tmou&lt;/a&gt;, která je letos online. Očekávám teda, že nevyluštíme ani jednu šifru :D&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="update"&gt;Update&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#update" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nestihl jsem poznámky před začátkem Tmou po sobě přečíst a vydat, takže vydávám až v sobotu o půl čtvrté. Skončili jsme kolem páté ráno u páté šifry na nádraží v České. Vypadala luštitelně, ale odpadli jsme silami. I když jsme v sobotu vstali až v jednu odpoledne, bolí mě hlava a jsem komplet rozbitý. Neumím si představit, že bychom to opravdu chodili v terénu, ale možná by nás to aspoň probralo. Zase kamarádka by u hraní venku asi nemohla během noci kojit. Všechno má svá pro a proti. Každopádně děkujeme organizátorům za pěknou hru, rozhraní s mapou bylo skvělé. Svou první Tmou v životě jsem si užil i z Prahy :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poznámky teda tentokrát píšu až v neděli. Ve středu jsem nepracoval, byl státní svátek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="prace-na-dalku"&gt;Práce na dálku&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#prace-na-dalku" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protože řádí covid-19, rozhodl jsem se soustředit na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/remote/"&gt;stránku s prací na dálku&lt;/a&gt; s tím, že uvidím, co všechno se z ní dá vymáčknout. Pokud by na ní bylo dost nabídek práce, přidal bych i nějaké rady na práci na dálku a celé bych to pak zkusil propagovat mezi lidmi. V současné chvíli by to mohlo mít nějaký ohlas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Přidal jsem tedy podporu pro &lt;a href="https://remoteok.io/"&gt;Remote OK&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://weworkremotely.com/"&gt;WWR&lt;/a&gt; a nabídky práce na dálku ze StackOverflow. Psal jsem i osobně na Pieteru Levelsovi na Twitteru, jestli mohu použít logo Remote OK, protože to vyžaduje v podmínkách, a dostal jsem svolení.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na stahování nabídek z RSS se skvěle hodil &lt;a href="https://github.com/kurtmckee/feedparser"&gt;feedparser&lt;/a&gt;. Taky jsem zjistil, že když si potřebuju dojít pro některé informace až na stránku s inzerátem, je dobré zkontrolovat, jestli stejně jako JG nepodporuje &lt;a href="https://schema.org/JobPosting"&gt;schema.org meta data&lt;/a&gt;. V takovém případě se totiž nemusím trápit s čtením HTML, stačí vytáhnout ta meta data. No a zjistil jsem, že na to existuje prima knihovna &lt;a href="https://github.com/scrapinghub/extruct/"&gt;extruct&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Výsledek ale nic moc, juniorní nabídky práce na dálku prostě nejsou. Sem tam něco, jasně, mám tam nějaké false positives i false negatives, OK, ale i když to všechno vezmu v úvahu, výsledek je spíš velké prd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="scrapovani"&gt;Scrapování&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#scrapovani" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeden pro mě důležitý zdroj nabídek práce blokuje HTTP requesty z IP adres CircleCI, kde se mi všechno spouští. Zkoušel jsem to &lt;a href="https://www.khalidalnajjar.com/stealthy-crawling-using-scrapy-tor-and-privoxy/"&gt;řešit přes Tor&lt;/a&gt;. Rozběhal jsem to lokálně, ale na CircleCI ne a nikdo mi neodpověděl ani na &lt;a href="https://tor.stackexchange.com/questions/21677/signal-response-contained-unrecognized-status-code-514"&gt;StackExchange dotaz&lt;/a&gt; (naopak mi napsali, že tohle dělat nemám…), takže jsem tuto cestu po dvou dnech průzkumu a debugování opustil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jako další možnost jsem zvažoval Apify, ale nakonec se mi nechtělo scraper psát odznova a zkusil jsem najít nějakou proxy, která by věc řešila. Nejlevnější řešení jsem našel u &lt;a href="https://scrapestack.com/"&gt;ScrapeStack&lt;/a&gt;, ale po základním otestování jsem zjistil, že mnou scrapovaný web na requesty routované přes ně odpovídá úplně jiným contentem a vynucuje přihlášení. Zajímavé. Nepovedlo se mi to nijak vyřešit, takže tato možnost padla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dále jsem zkoušel najít nějaký seznam proxy zdarma, které bych mohl rotovat a dělat requesty přes ně. Zkoušel jsem &lt;a href="http://free-proxy.cz"&gt;free-proxy.cz&lt;/a&gt;, koukal na věci jako &lt;a href="https://proxybroker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;proxybroker&lt;/a&gt; (vypadá skvěle, ale je neudržovaný) nebo &lt;a href="https://github.com/imWildCat/scylla"&gt;scylla&lt;/a&gt;, studoval jsem seznam na &lt;a href="https://github.com/lorien/awesome-web-scraping/blob/master/python.md"&gt;awesome-web-scraping&lt;/a&gt;. Proxy různě fungují nebo nefungují, jsou různě blokovány nebo nejsou, no byl to velký boj a zase vydal tak na dva dny. V jednu chvíli jsem to vzdal a šel zkoumat to Apify, ale po dvou hodinách zkoušení a čtení dokumentace jsem došel k tomu, že to má stejný problém jako ten ScrapeStack, tedy že web na requesty odpoví přihlašovací stránkou a já nevím proč.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takže zpátky k proxy. Nakonec jsem našel relativně udržovaný a strojově čitelný seznam na &lt;a href="https://github.com/clarketm/proxy-list"&gt;clarketm/proxy-list&lt;/a&gt; a vyladil scrapování tak, aby se proxy uměly rotovat. To ale nijak nepomohlo, web mé requesty stále blokoval. Takže abychom si to shrnuli, na co jsem přišel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hotová řešení z webu vydolují akorát přihlašovací stránku.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requesty z různých proxy nebo sdílených IP adres, byť střídané a rotované, mi blokují.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I když jsem mezi requesty dal nesmyslné rozestupy, stále blokují.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I když jsem ořezával různé trackování a vypnul cookies, stále blokují.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I když jsem rotoval user agenty, stále blokují.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chtěl jsem to vzdát a vykašlat se na to, ale nakonec mě napadlo ještě něco. Web funguje tak, že jejich HTML se dále na věci dotazuje nějakého neveřejného API. Můj scraper se dotazoval na nabídky práce skrze toto API a tento request, typicky první, většinou prošel. Jenže ty další, na jednotlivé nabídky práce, ty už byly blokované. No ale to byly requesty na samotné HTML stránky. Napadlo mě, jestli nejde i ty nabídky samotné tahat přes API a upravit scraper tak, aby šel se vším jen přes API. No a vypadá to, že toto je výsledná cesta, že tím se všechno vyřeší. Na API zřejmě nemají tak drsné ochrany a requestům se tam celkem daří.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zbývá doladit detaily a zjistit, jestli celá tahle věc nebude tak neefektivní, že bude trvat dve hodiny scrapnout 5 nabídek práce, ale zatím výsledek považuji za úspěch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otázkou samozřejmě je, jak správné je toto všechno dělat, ale tož když si mohlo Kiwi oscrapovat půl internetu a založit si na tom byznys… Mým protějškem je obrovská monopolní mega korporace, se kterou se nikdy nedomluvím a jež nemá důvod se mnou spolupracovat. Jsou tam ale nabídky práce pro juniory a já je chci těm juniorům dát na podnose, aby se nemuseli přes jejich nesmyslné filtry prohrabávat tunou smetí.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Dokončili jsme více méně můj melouch pro kamaráda.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Po schválení finálních úprav jsem vydal &lt;a href="https://blog.python.cz/pyladies-to-zacalo-kanadou-to-neskoncilo"&gt;článek o Baru z Kanady&lt;/a&gt; na blogu české Python komunity. Také jsem ji hned přidal i mezi &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/#stories"&gt;příběhy na hlavní stránce JG&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Radůza mi odepsala na e-mail a poděkovala za fajn rady :)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Podcasty neposlouchám, nenašel jsem si k nim zatím moc cestu. Ale něco jsem teď o víkendu zkusil a toto se mi líbilo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vutbr.cz/podcast"&gt;Technicky vzato&lt;/a&gt;, podcast VUT v Brně. Dva díly o robotech nebo esportu. Líbí se mi, že jeden díl má 20 minut a ne sto hodin, jako u jiných podcastů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://fallofcivilizationspodcast.com/"&gt;Fall of Civilizations Podcast&lt;/a&gt; je konečně něco na téma, které mě baví. Nevedou se tam rozhovory s lidmi, je to spíš dokumentární seriál.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id="minuly-tyden"&gt;Minulý týden&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#minuly-tyden" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minulý týden jsem byl na dovolené v Krkonoších. Bylo tam hnusně a většinu času jsme se ženou četli &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16842985-honza"&gt;knihy&lt;/a&gt;, hráli &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/236850/Europa_Universalis_IV/"&gt;hry&lt;/a&gt;, nebo se na něco dívali. Bylo to ale super a kdybychom nejeli teď, asi by nám dovolená zůstala do konce roku nevybraná, nebo bychom ji museli nějak vybrat v době lockdownu a temna (krátké dny).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="Krkonoše" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/krkonose.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
Černohorské rašeliniště&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tento-tyden"&gt;Tento týden&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#tento-tyden" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tento týden nějak utekl, ani nevím jak. Vzal jsem jeden malý melouch pro kamaráda, připravit podhoubí pro nějaké jejich Python balíčky. Myslel jsem, že to bude na pár hodin, ale vypadá to, že stav balíčkování v Pythonu, byť to pokročilo, je stále strašný - zkuste si např. udělat poetry balíček, který ale půjde nainstalovat i jako editable… Dnes (v pátek) jsem se moc nevyspal, celé dopoledne debugoval balíčky, odpoledne zjistil, že to stejně nefunguje, rozlil jsem kafe po celém stole a nestíhal dokončit e-maily (viz další sekce), ale naštěstí mě kamarád vzal na procházku Olšanskými hřbitovy a tam jsem se nějak uklidnil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="Hrobky" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/hrobky.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
Vždycky může být hůř&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="e-maily"&gt;E-maily&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#e-maily" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jak jsem tady už dříve psal, SendGrid mi nedoručuje maily spolehlivě a já si vyhodnotil, že vzhledem k počtu, který posílám, bych jej mohl nahradit Gmailem. Našel jsem knihovnu &lt;a href="https://github.com/kootenpv/yagmail"&gt;yagmail&lt;/a&gt; a tento týden jsem se na to chtěl podívat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knihovnu jsem nakonec nepoužil, rozhodl jsem se prostě a jednoduše posílat ty maily přes SMTP. Odebral jsem tedy SendGrid a použil &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html"&gt;smtplib&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.html"&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;, které jsou přímo ve standardní knihovně v Pythonu. Pokud máte zapnuté 2FA, musíte si pro připojení ke googlímu SMTP &lt;a href="https://security.google.com/settings/security/apppasswords"&gt;vygenerovat aplikační heslo&lt;/a&gt;. Pak už to funguje jako každé jiné posílání mailů z Pythonu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blbé je, že &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.html"&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; zjevně prošel nějakým překopáním a má nový interface a starý interface. Návodů na ten starý je plný internet a všechno se to motá dohromady. Navíc ta dokumentace, tak jak je ve standardní knihovně, je strašná. Totální &lt;em&gt;wall of text&lt;/em&gt; a jako by to psal nějaký maniak, který si myslí, že chci vědět úplně všechno o MIME. Je tam naštěstí &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/email-examples.html"&gt;pár příkladů&lt;/a&gt;, ale i s nimi je to za trest, pokoušet se s tím něco vyrobit. Přitom ten interface asi není špatný, jen je pro laika složitý a chybí nějaký 1 2 3 tutoriál jak rychle udělat, co potřebuju, i bez toho, abych přečetl pět RFC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Každopádně tohle celé mě trochu motivovalo překopat moje posílací skripty. Oddělil jsem od sebe hlavně logiku vytváření zpráv a logiku debugování odesílání e-mailů. Mělo by to teď být testovatelnější, méně by se měl opakovat kód a mělo by to všechno být míň zamotané do sebe. Objekt &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.message.html#email.message.EmailMessage"&gt;EmailMessage&lt;/a&gt; jsem původně chtěl použít napříč programem, ale nakonec jsem vyhodnotil, že je tak blbě zdokumentovaný a tak málo abstrahuje detaily MIME specifikace, že budu raději jednotlivé zprávy připravovat jako obyčejný slovník a tuhle věc vytvořím až těsně před odesláním. Výhodou je, že ten objekt nemusím už dále studovat a můžu ty skripty jednodušeji testovat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tož uvidíme v pondělí, co všechno jsem rozbil a kolik se toho pošle. Taky bych si měl na to asi vytvořit nějakou speciální Gmail schránku, aby mi Google nezablokoval osobní účet, kdyby mi někde ujela nekonečná smyčka a omylem jsem poslal tisíc mailů, ale na to už tento týden nebyl čas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ze &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz"&gt;své homepage&lt;/a&gt; jsem odebral týdenní poznámky, moc to tam plevelily. Na &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/"&gt;homepage blogu&lt;/a&gt; zůstávají všechny články.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jelikož je z poznámek už celkem tradice a nezařízl jsem to po pár týdnech, přidal jsem si do skriptu pro jejich generování i číslování. Toto jsou tedy poznámky číslo 23.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mám nové doporučení od juniora, který přečetl příručku. Zatím si ty doporučení skladuji &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/hire-juniors/#handbook"&gt;sem&lt;/a&gt;, než vymyslím, jak je jednou zobrazím lépe. Nové doporučení je pod číslem čtyři.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na radu z dopisů čtenářek jsem přidal do &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/learn/#english"&gt;sekce o angličtině&lt;/a&gt; Italki. Vím, že existuje i Blabu, ale nevím, jaký je mezi nimi rozdíl. Všichni kolem mě jedou Italki. Já nepoužívám ani jedno.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na radu kamaráda jsem přidal k Italki i Duolingo také affiliate odkazy. Přidávají kredit jak mě, tak vám. Jsou vždy v popisku jako bonus, odkaz přes obrázek vede normálně bez affiliate. Protože Italki nepoužívám, dal jsem tam pozvánkový odkaz z účtu bráchy, jehož děti Italki používají dost a učí se přes to jazyky. Pokud teda chcete Italki zkusit, můžete jít přes &lt;a href="https://www.italki.com/i/6fGdDG?hl=en-us"&gt;tento odkaz&lt;/a&gt; a budete mít $10 slevu a bude ji pak mít i můj brácha.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pořešil jsem zase po nějaké době upgradování dependencies na pár Pyvec projektech.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přišel mi &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/fiobank/pull/25"&gt;Pull Request na fiobank knihovnu s nějakou opravou&lt;/a&gt;, tak jsem to mergnul. U toho jsem zjistil, že se knihovna nereleasuje a Travis CI nějak nefunugje, takže jsem to pak celé ještě opravoval a releasoval.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přidal jsem na JG &lt;a href="https://link.medium.com/C0YDsBUErab"&gt;příběh o Páji&lt;/a&gt;, která prošla PyLadies a pak ji vzali do Irska do Facebooku. Je &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/#stories"&gt;mezi ostatními na hlavní stránce&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během mého pobytu v Krkonoších vyšel článek o &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/candidate-handbook/"&gt;příručce&lt;/a&gt; na CzechCrunch, juchů! &lt;a href="https://www.czechcrunch.cz/2020/10/boreni-mytu-a-uzitecne-rady-pro-kazdeho-zacatecnika-honza-javorek-vydava-prirucku-o-hledani-prvni-prace-v-it/"&gt;Boření mýtů a užitečné rady pro každého začátečníka. Honza Javorek vydává příručku o hledání první práce v IT&lt;/a&gt;. Už bych si měl založit sekci "napsali o nás". Zatím jsem jen přidal logo CzechCrunch &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/hire-juniors/"&gt;sem&lt;/a&gt;. Vlastně jsem ho jen odkomentoval, protože jsem ho tam přidal už dřív a jen jsem čekal, až článek vydají :D&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jeden junior mi napsal delší e-mail o tom, zda bych mu neporadil s kariérním směřováním. Poradil jsem mu, nějakou tu hoďku mě to stálo. Nic jsem si za to nevzal, protože zatím jen zkoumám terén - pokud by takto junioři chodili nějak častěji, možná bych z toho vytvořil nějaký produkt nebo to prostě nabízel jako službu, ale zatím toho není dost a nevidím v tom ani úplně nějaký vzorec.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jiný junior se mě v podobném duchu zeptal, zda bych neprošel jeho CV a LinkedIn a nepomohl mu to vyladit. Pověnoval jsem se tomu, zabralo to několik hodin a ještě jsme to pak spolu probírali dlouho do večera. Sám jsem nevěděl, co od toho čekat. Překvapilo mě, jak relevantní rady jsem mu vlastně dokázal dát :D Je to pro mě potvrzení, že toto bych mohl dělat i za peníze. Zatím jsem to udělal tak, že mi může dotyčný poslat na můj &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/donate/"&gt;donate účet&lt;/a&gt; tolik, kolik si myslí, že si zasloužím.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domluvil jsem si jednu malou přednášku o JG pro účastníky jednoho bootcampu. Blbé je, že teď ji budu muset připravit :) Naštěstí je na to celkem dost času.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Úplně omylem jsem na ČT zahlédl reportáž o tom, &lt;a href="https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/kultura/3208318-raduza-mozna-vymeni-harmoniku-za-tu-autobusovou-i-dalsi-umelci-si-hledaji-jinou"&gt;jak Radůza uvažuje i o kurzu webových stránek&lt;/a&gt;. Byl bych raději, kdyby Radůza mohla hrát a zpívat, ale doba je, jaká je, takže jsem jí napsal e-mail, ať mrkne na JG, protože tam všechno najde. Zatím to vypadá jako jeden z mnoha e-mailů, které jsem někam někomu naslepo napsal, a na které nikdy nedostanu odpověď, ale asi mě to baví zkoušet :) Třeba z toho někdy bude nějaká haluz.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ozval se mi borec, kterého jsem před rokem náhodou potkal v čajovně, že je z něj teď teda programátor a všechno to hezky sepsal do článku. Domluvili jsme se, že jej vydáme na blogu Python komunity a tak se i stalo. Než jsme vše doladili, pár hodin si to vzalo. &lt;a href="https://blog.python.cz/programatorem-za-365-dni-a-zadarmo-tak-urcite"&gt;Programátorem za 365 dní a zadarmo? Tak určitě!&lt;/a&gt;. Přidal jsem to hned po vydání i &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/#stories"&gt;na hlavní stránku&lt;/a&gt; JG mezi příběhy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Když už jsem byl na blogu, zahléhl jsem tam &lt;a href="https://github.com/pyvec/blog.python.cz/pull/69"&gt;rozpracovaný článek od Baru z Kanady&lt;/a&gt;. Řekl jsem si, že to zkousím prošťouchnout. Nic jsem od toho nečekal, ale Baru se ozvala a článek nejspíš doděláme! To by byl hned další příběh hodný hlavní stránky JG :)&lt;/li&gt;

Ti dva ale působí jak prodejci amway v umělohmotných oblecích, kteří si na pivu honí ega nad tím, jací kokoti jsou lidi, kterým prodávají. Věřím, že takhle mohlo HR vypadat v devadesátkách, ale dnes?

&lt;p&gt;V pondělí jsem měl dovolenou.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="novy-vzhled-stranek-s-nabidkami-prace"&gt;Nový vzhled stránek s nabídkami práce&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#novy-vzhled-stranek-s-nabidkami-prace" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vytvořil jsem stránku pro &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/remote/"&gt;juniorní nabídky práce na dálku&lt;/a&gt;. S tím, co jsem si všechno připravil minulý týden, to bylo hotové za půl hodiny.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tím jsem splnil dva nejžádanější body z &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/junior.guru/permalink/450085692581710/"&gt;ankety mezi uživateli JG&lt;/a&gt;: Filtrování podle regionu a podle toho, jestli jde o práci na dálku.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Menu, kde si člověk překlikává regiony, jsem nějak nadesignoval a dal do horní části stránek. Nejsem s tím ještě nějak extra spokojený, ale je to lepší, než to bylo, takže šup s tím na produkci. Uvažuju, že bych ho na desktopu dal možná doleva jako sloupec, podobně jako je &lt;em&gt;table of contents&lt;/em&gt; u příručky a dalších stránek.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Snažil jsem se, aby byly v novém vzhledu &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/"&gt;stránky s nabídkami práce&lt;/a&gt; jasně a pokud možno stručně vyzdvižené hodnoty tohoto pracovního portálu oproti jiným, a to tak, aby to zapůsobilo jak na juniory, tak na firmy. Přibyly loga firem, které už u mě inzerovaly, a také loga míst, odkud stahuji další nabídky práce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aby byla každému jasná hodnota mého robota, jsou tam přímo čísla, kolik nabídek práce robot vyřadil a kolik nechal. Chtěl jsem k tomu původně nakreslit robotické kuře, jak přebírá zrníčka, ale nakonec jsem byl líný to kreslit, a taky tam úplně není místa nazbyt. Abych mohl čísla zobrazit, musel jsem si na to připravit metriky na backendu a taky to správně spočítat (kdo ví, jak to mám s matematikou, nepřekvapí, že správně spočítat se mi to povedlo až napodruhé).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Myslel jsem, že tlačítko na přidání pracovní nabídky bude někde vpravo nahoře a bude se posunovat spolu se stránkou, ale jakýkoliv pokus o toto řešení, který jsem učinil, se mi nelíbil. Prozatím je tedy tlačítko součástí pruhu odkazů na různé další věci.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protože by ho tam ale každý přehlédl, vytasil jsem se s &lt;a href="https://roughnotation.com/"&gt;touhle blbinkou&lt;/a&gt;, kterou jsem chtěl už hrozně dlouho použít, a která myslím náramně sedí do designu JG. Dokonce jsem si potom i pohrál s tím, aby se kroužek kolem odkazu kreslil až ve chvíli, kdy člověk odkaz vidí. Použil jsem &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API"&gt;IntersectionObserver&lt;/a&gt; a zdokumentoval to v &lt;a href="https://github.com/rough-stuff/rough-notation/issues/51#issuecomment-705472507"&gt;GitHub Issue na projektu knihovny&lt;/a&gt;. Je to taková blbost, ale než vymyslím to tlačítko líp, bude mi tam dělat radost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ladil jsem SEO elementy (&lt;em&gt;title&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;description&lt;/em&gt;) a různé texty na jednotlivých stránkách.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upravil jsem zmínku o nabídkách práce na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/"&gt;úvodní stránce&lt;/a&gt;. Tlačítko, které mířilo na newsletter, nyní míří přímo na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/candidate-handbook/"&gt;příručku o hledání první práce v IT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;O nabídkách práce se zmiňovala i samotná příručka, takže jsem se na to podíval a trochu to předělal. Vlastně nakonec úplně, ne trochu. Překopal jsem celou kapitolu o pracovních portálech. Dal jsem ji jako první ve své sekci a rozšířil jsem ji o vysvětlení nevýhod pracovních portálů. To může znít jako blbost, když jeden provozuji, ale není, protože kapitola končí tím, že pracovní portál na JG některé tyto problémy řeší, a vlastně tak kapitola čtenářům vysvětluje hodnotu mého produktu. Jelikož všechno, co tam píšu, je pravda, tak nemyslím, že je to nějaká nestoudná reklama - &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/candidate-handbook/#job-boards"&gt;posuďte sami&lt;/a&gt;. Odcitoval jsem tam i &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ictmhp2uJu8"&gt;yablka&lt;/a&gt;, který poslední dobou točí &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/yablko/status/1301811097159245825"&gt;hezká videa na toto téma&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Už delší dobu jsem toužil po tom, abych mohl na nabídky práce upozorňovat &lt;em&gt;inline&lt;/em&gt; v textu nebo třeba na 404ce. Vytvořil jsem tedy design pro takový menší, osekanější výpis nabídek práce, který funguje spíš jako upoutávka, než cokoliv jiného. Tento výpis jsem dal do relevantních částí příručky, vždy tak, aby to bylo nenásilné a plynule to navazovalo na kontext. Třeba u stáží je výpis pár stáží, pokud na JG zrovna nějaké jsou. Totéž u práce na dálku nebo dobrovolnictví. Výpis nabídek jsem dal i na tu 404ku. 404ka je důležitá, protože pokud na JG vyprší nabídka práce, původní URL už nikam nemíří a uživateli se zobrazí právě 404ka. Je tedy dobré, pokud člověka nasměruje na další nabídky práce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opravil jsem průběžně spoustu nějakých vizuálnách bugů ve vzhledu výpisu nabídek práce a i jinde.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ve čtvrtek večer jsem se u sledování &lt;a href="https://www.csfd.cz/film/236434-souboj-titanu/prehled/"&gt;Souboje Titánů (2010)&lt;/a&gt; musel opít vínem, abych film dokončil, takže se mi v pátek už nechělo nic moc dělat. Místo něčeho důležitého jsem vytáhl z hlubin backlogu průzkum &lt;a href="https://schema.org/"&gt;schema.org&lt;/a&gt;, což je způsob, jak lze sémanticky označit kusy stránky tak, aby jim mohli lépe porozumět roboti. Proč to dělat? Třeba Google je pak schopen stránku ve výsledcích zobrazit s nějakou přidanou hodnotou. Viz článek &lt;a href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/schema-structured-data"&gt;tady&lt;/a&gt; nebo &lt;a href="https://www.semrush.com/blog/what-is-schema-beginner-s-guide-to-structured-data/"&gt;tady&lt;/a&gt;. Jedna z věcí, které jde označovat, je &lt;a href="https://schema.org/JobPosting"&gt;nabídka práce&lt;/a&gt;, což je pro JG jasná volba. Návod &lt;a href="https://schema.org/docs/gs.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, debugger &lt;a href="https://search.google.com/test/rich-results"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, za chvilu bylo hotovo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upravil jsem čísla na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/hire-juniors/"&gt;stránce pro firmy&lt;/a&gt; tak, aby se místo 11000 zobrazovalo 11tis a otestoval jsem to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Videohovor o melouchu, do kterého se brzo pustím. Něco ohledně správného nastavení packagingu Python balíčků.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Koukal jsem na Scrapy &lt;a href="https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/autothrottle.html"&gt;AUTOTHROTTLE&lt;/a&gt; nastavení a zkusil jej nastavit. Podle všeho by mělo stačit napsat do nastavení &lt;code&gt;AUTOTHROTTLE_ENABLED = True&lt;/code&gt; :D Nevím, jestli to bude méně zatěžovat stránky, ze kterých stahuju nabídky práce, ale třeba jo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Produkce u JG vypadá tak, že se v noci spustí &lt;a href="https://circleci.com/"&gt;CircleCI&lt;/a&gt;, stáhne informace z internetu, vybuildí statickou webovou stránku a následně deployne na &lt;a href="https://vercel.com/"&gt;Vercel&lt;/a&gt;. Problém je, že CircleCI mašinky jsou samozřejmě z venku nějaká sdílená IP adresa, kterou všichni používají na všechno, a tudíž ji některé weby přímo blokují. Udělal jsem si tedy základní rešerši ohledně toho, co se dá dělat, když chce člověk používat nějakou jinou IP adresu, než na které je. Vylezlo mi z toho zatím &lt;a href="https://www.scrapehero.com/make-anonymous-requests-using-tor-python/"&gt;tohle&lt;/a&gt;, případně &lt;a href="https://www.khalidalnajjar.com/stealthy-crawling-using-scrapy-tor-and-privoxy/"&gt;tohle&lt;/a&gt;. Zatím jsem ani jedno nezkoušel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V podobném duchu jsem se pustil do hledání alternativy &lt;a href="https://sendgrid.com/"&gt;SendGridu&lt;/a&gt;. Jeho free plan má sdílené IP adresy, které se snadno mohou dostat do blocklistů. Takže e-maily, které pošlu, nemusí dorazit, jelikož je někdo po cestě zablokuje. Psal jsem na support, ale nic s tím nehodlají dělat. IP lze zaplatit, ale stojí to $90, což je pro mě trochu overkill. Já potřebuji posílat jen pár e-mailů, nejde mi o množství, ale potřebuji je posílat fakt spolehlivě. Alternativ je nesčetně. Pokud vás zajímají, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1313411971044257792"&gt;projděte si odpovědi zde&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moje poznatky ohledně e-mailů: To, co chci, se jmenuje &lt;em&gt;transactional emails&lt;/em&gt;. Existuje na to spousta služeb, které poskytují velké objemy a platí se hlavně za kvalitu doručování. Čím levnější, tím horší doručitelnost. Pokud je to zdarma, používají to spammeři a nedoručím ani prd. Pokud posílám desítky e-mailů (jakože posílám), nejspíš mi bude stačit prozatím posílat to normálně přes Gmailové SMTP :D Vlastně nevím, proč mě to předtím vůbec nenapadlo. Člověk má plnou hlavu &lt;em&gt;best practices&lt;/em&gt;, až přes ně potom nevidí dostačující řešení.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Když jsem se koukal na nějaké vhodné knihovny, nejvíc se mi zatím zalíbilo &lt;a href="https://github.com/kootenpv/yagmail"&gt;yagmail&lt;/a&gt;, ale pokud znáte něco lepšího, dejte vědět.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zdálo se mi, že se 1. října neodeslaly maily ohledně sponzorských log. No a taky že ne! Takže jsem našel chyby, proč se tak stalo, a skripty opravil. Znovu to posílat nebudu, inzerenti počkají do 1. listopadu. Nikdo si nestěžoval a já stejně musím nejdřív vyřešit to doručování mailů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toť vše! Další poznámky budou za dva týdny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-co-vy"&gt;A co vy?&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#a-co-vy" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud byste čistě náhodou měli dojem, že jste oproti mě za uplynulý týden vůbec nic nestihli, tak mám pro vás skvělou zprávu! V klidu se na ten dojem &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/neni-to-zavod/"&gt;můžete vykašlat&lt;/a&gt;. Není zač!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tento týden jsem pracoval na tom, abych mohl mít samostatné stránky s inzeráty práce pro juniorní programátory pro každý region zvlášť.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="normalizace-mista"&gt;Normalizace místa&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#normalizace-mista" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nabídky práce z JG i odjinud mají většinou (pokud nejsou úplně na dálku) informaci o tom, odkud jsou. Už v této větě můžete odtušit hned několik problémů, které jsem musel vyřešit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Místo nabídky práce může být v libovolném formátu. Praha. Prague. Brno, Czechia. Káranice, Česká republika. Michálkovická 1137/197, 710 00 Ostrava - Slezská Ostrava, Czechia. Záleží na tom, co se autor nabídky rozhodl vepsat do políčka nebo odkud jsem nabídku převzal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Existují nabídky práce, které žádné místo nemají.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K tomu ještě:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Některé nabídky jsou platné pro více míst. To se projeví tak, že se mi objeví v datech totožná nabídka s jiným místem, nebo že někdo napíše do políčka: Praha nebo Brno. Ostrava nebo na dálku.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Některé nabídky mají místo, třeba kde je hlavní kancelář, ale jsou zároveň i na dálku.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Základní věc, kterou jsem tedy musel udělat, bylo normalizovat nějak tato data. Popíšu to jako proces tak, jak šly moje pokusy za sebou. Nechť je to dokumentace toho, jak se někdy motám v kruzích a nejsem několik dní schopen něco kloudného vytvořit, protože overengineeruju nebo se sice snažím problém zjednodušit, ale špatným směrem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Už dříve jsem si dělal základní rešerši, jak by se to dalo řešit. Znám služby na geocoding, ale matně jsem si pamatoval, že jsou placené a tomu jsem se chtěl zatím vyhnout. Chtěl jsem najít nějakou "offline" variantu, do které můžu bušit libovolné množství požadavků. Také jsem se rozhodl, že budu nabídky dělit podle krajů, které ale pojmenuji podle jejich hlavních měst, plus sousední země. Region tedy v kontextu JG může být Praha (kraje Praha a SČ), Brno (JMK), nebo třeba Německo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rešerše mi vyhodila projekt &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/geograpy/"&gt;geograpy&lt;/a&gt; a s tím jsem tedy i začal. Je postavený nad NLTK a potřebuje si tedy dodatečně stáhnout nějaká data (korpusy). Vše jsem v projektu připravil pro použití geograpy, ale měl jsem problém s instalací. &lt;a href="https://github.com/somnathrakshit/geograpy3/issues/20"&gt;Založené issue na GitHubu&lt;/a&gt; jsme nakonec vyřešili do rekordních 10 minut. Jenže když jsem knihovnu vyzkoušel na pár vstupech, zjistil jsem, že vůbec neví, která bije. Na většinu mi nevrátila nic a jednou jsem dokonce dostal něco jako &lt;code&gt;Praha, Slovakia&lt;/code&gt;. Takže jsem to odinstaloval a všechny věci, co už jsem k tomu připravil, jsem smazal. &lt;strong&gt;Poučení:&lt;/strong&gt; Nejdřív vyzkoušej, jestli knihovna vůbec funguje, než jí budeš dělat místečko ve svém projektu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pořád jsem se držel pocitu, že chci tu normalizaci řešit "offline", už jen proto, že se nabídky práce většinou vyskytují jen v okolí několika větších měst. Toto ovšem nebylo zjednodušení problému, nýbrž jeho komplikace. Zkoušel jsem nějak ručně a jednoduše normalizovat adresy podle seznamu &lt;a href="https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seznam_m%C4%9Bst_v_%C4%8Cesku_podle_po%C4%8Dtu_obyvatel"&gt;nejlidnatějších měst u nás&lt;/a&gt; apod., ale nikam to nevedlo. Navíc stejně, co s adresami, které se do tohoto netrefí?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vytušil jsem, že se zase v něčem moc vrtám, když to jde řešit snadno a rychle, takže jsem sáhl po tom, co znám velmi dobře a už jsem to v minulosti několikrát použil: &lt;a href="https://github.com/DenisCarriere/geocoder"&gt;geocoder&lt;/a&gt;. Tento projekt umožňuje přeložit adresy na zeměpisné souřadnice pomocí různých veřejných API určených k tomuto účelu. &lt;a href="https://geocoder.readthedocs.io/providers/OpenStreetMap.html"&gt;Nominatim&lt;/a&gt; od OpenStreetMaps je zdarma, takže to byla jasná volba. Upravil jsem kód a bylo to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zjistil jsem ale, že geocoder mi dává malou flexibilitu v tom, jaké parametry mohu OpenStreetMaps poslat. Chtěl jsem totiž ovlivnit, v jakém jazyce přijdou výsledky apod. Narazil jsem na knihovnu &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/geopy/"&gt;geopy&lt;/a&gt;, která vypadala jako ještě známější a používanější projekt. Takže jsem geocoder vyměnil za geopy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Záhy jsem si odzkoušel, že jazyk asi nakonec nastavovat nebudu, protože sice chci Německo místo Deutschland, ale nějak se mi příčilo mít Vratislav místo Wrocław, Lipsko místo Leipzig, a nedej bože, aby se mi tam objevila nabídka práce z Gratzu. Takže jazyk jsem nechal být a udělal si překladovou tabulku na těch pár hodnot, které mě zajímají. Stejně jsem tabulku potřeboval už na to, abych přejmenoval kraje z Vysočina na Jihlava.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nakonec jsem ale zjistil, že ani Nominatim nezvládá dobře některé zcela standardní adresy, např. na něco jako "Brno, South Moravia" to myslím bylo schopné vrátit cosi v Novém Jičíně. Už jsem to měl na produkci a byl to celkem problém (viz další kapitola těchto poznámek), ale naštěstí se zatím jen ukládala data a nikam se to nezobrazovalo, takže to nebylo nic, co by na noc nezachránil jeden &lt;code&gt;try/except/pass&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chyby ve stávajícím kódu mě donutily, abych do JG přidal lepší podporu pro evidenci toho, zda jde v nabídce o práci na dálku nebo ne. U externích zdrojů nabídek to nebyl moc velký problém přidat (byť jeden zápas s XPath mě asi bude ještě chvíli budit ze sna). U JG to ale vyžadovalo změnit formulář na zadávání nabídek a tuto položku tam přidat, plus upravit stávající data. Snažil jsem se navíc nějak chytře pojmenovat políčka tak, aby mi lidé možnost o práci na dálku nepsali do místa. Skončil jsem u toho, že políčko pro práci na dálku je ano/ne, je povinné a je před políčkem pro místo. Políčko pro místo je nepovinné a nese název "Office location".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upravil jsem celý backend tak, aby počítal se změnami v datech. Jednak bylo potřeba začít všude evidovat práci na dálku, jednak se místo stalo nepovinnou položkou, což mě donutilo přeházet vidlema spoustu kódu a napsat spoustu testů. Informaci o tom, zda je pozice na dálku, jsem na webu zobrazil aspoň v podobě štítku. Taky se to zobrazuje i u místa. Pokud žádné není, je tam jen "na dálku", nebo se vypíše třeba "Brno, na dálku", pokud se zdá, že nabídka umožňuje oboje.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jal jsem se řešit nespolehlivost OpenStreetMaps pro geocoding českých míst. Nová rešerše. Google &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/usage-and-billing"&gt;stojí 5 USD za 1000 dotazů&lt;/a&gt;, což samozřejmě není moc, ale já prostě nějak nemám dobrý pocit z toho, když Googlu do cloudu někam dávám kreditku a zapínám placenou službu. Asi je to jen psychologické, ale já se prostě bojím, že mi někde uteče nějaký token a s ním i spousta peněz. S Googlím supportem se nechci nikdy v životě dohadovat. Google navíc nebere &lt;a href="https://revolut.com/referral/janh8pm"&gt;Revolut&lt;/a&gt;, takže se to nedá nijak pošéfovat z mojí strany, abych měl klidnější spaní. Musel bych mít asi nějaký prázdný bankovní účet jen na tohle a k němu kartu, kam bych posílal tak akorát peněz. Prostě ne. Pokud můžu, placeným službám z takovýchto generických flexibilních cloudů (ať už je to Google, AWS, Microsoft…) se chci asi zatím vyhnout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Problém taky je, že spousta geocoding služeb na adresu odpoví zeměpisnými souřadnicemi, ale ty já vlastně vůbec nepotřebuji. Mě zajímá jen rozpad na jednotlivé administrativní celky, jako je město, kraj, země. To je u geocodingu vlastně doplňková věc, která je přímo ve výsledcích jen u některých služeb. Obejít se to dá reverse geocodingem (tzn. vložím souřadnice a dostanu, co všechno na nich je), ale to zase znamená dva dotazy na API pro každé místo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pokukoval jsem dále po Mapboxu, který má dokonce &lt;a href="https://www.mapbox.com/pricing/"&gt;geocoding do 100000 požadavků zdarma&lt;/a&gt;. Na &lt;a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/search-playground/"&gt;hřišti&lt;/a&gt; to vypadalo dobře i pro ČR, ale problém zase je, že jejich podmínky použití vylučují ukládání výsledků. Musí to být interaktivní služba, v podstatě "napovídátko" pro uživatele k Mapboxí mapě, ně nějaký backendový robot. Geocoding pro taková použití mají, ale je to prémiová služba ("contact sales").&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Následně se vynořila nějaká &lt;a href="https://www.zdrojak.cz/clanky/api-k-ceskym-turistickym-mapam/"&gt;vzpomínka na mladá léta, kdy jsem dělal bakalářku a hrál jsem si s mapovými portály v ČR&lt;/a&gt;. Nemá náhodou geocoding i Seznam? V jejich &lt;a href="https://api.mapy.cz/"&gt;dokumentaci žádné API člověk nenajde&lt;/a&gt;, ale &lt;a href="https://github.com/Kdyby/GeocoderSeznamMaps/blob/master/src/SeznamMapsProvider.php"&gt;internet, Open Source a základní znalost PHP pomůže&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://api.mapy.cz/geocode?query=Brno,%20South%20Moravia,%20Czech%20Republic"&gt;Brno, South Moravia, Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://api.mapy.cz/rgeocode?lat=49.200221&amp;amp;lon=16.607841"&gt;49.200221,16.607841&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://api.mapy.cz/geocode?query=Bratislava"&gt;Bratislava&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://api.mapy.cz/rgeocode?lat=48.13710786189762&amp;amp;lon=11.575382173497758"&gt;48.13710786189762,11.575382173497758&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Podmínky použití zmiňují, že nesmím ručně či strojově dolovat data a ukládat je či stahovat, nicméně se řídím spíš záměrem odstavce, kde tuším ochranu proti krádeži databáze, než že bych to bral doslovně. Pokud by náhodou někomu vadilo co dělám, věřím, že se Seznamem se normálně domluvím. Ono já na JG vlastně nic ani kešovat tak úplně nemůžu, protože žádné persistentní úložiště kromě Google Sheets nemám. Moje SQLite se při každém CI běhu vytváří nanovo z lokálních YAML souborů a stažených dat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Super je, že tenhle geocoding funguje přesně tak, jak potřebuji. V Česku má kvalitní data a pro zbytek světa bere data z OpenStreetMaps. Blbé je, že musím dělat ty dva dotazy, protože v první odpovědi nedostanu info o regionu a zemi. To se ale asi dá přežít. Nakonec já toto dělám jen pro nabídky, které se budou zobrazovat na webu, a těch jsou, ač vzniknou třízením stovek nabídek, zatím pouze desítky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Byť API není JSON, v Pythonu to bylo na pár řádků. A vyhodil jsem geopy. Kdo máte čas a chuť, můžete pro geopy napsat adaptér pro tohle Mapy.cz API, to by bylo určitě fajn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V této fázi jsem se už už chystal nějak normalizovat zemi, a to skrze knihovnu &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/pycountry/"&gt;pycountry&lt;/a&gt;, která vypadá fakt dobře. Hlavně ta funkce &lt;code&gt;search_fuzzy()&lt;/code&gt;! Jenže ještě než jsem ji vůbec nainstaloval, tak jsem si uvědomil, že vlastně zemi vůbec na nic nepotřebuji, kromě určení regionu. Myslel jsem, že budu zobrazovat třeba "Berlin, DE" a u českých věcí jen "Brno" místo "Brno, CZ". Jenže to potom může vzniknout "Adamov, CZ". A každý neví, kde to je, nebo mohou být různé Adamovy v různých krajích. Ve skutečnosti dává mnohem větší smysl zobrazit "[město], [region]", pokud jsou to různé hodnoty, a jinak prostě "[město]". To řeší úplně všechno, ať už je to Brno, Berlín nebo Adamov. A stačí mi k tomu jen hodnota pro region, žádnou další informaci o zemi zvlášť už nepotřebuji.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ošetřil jsem, aby se vytvořily dvě a více nabídek práce, pokud mi někdo na JG zadá inzerát, kde je jako místo např. "Praha nebo Ostrava". Pokud někdo vymyslí něco ještě úplně jiného, mohu to v Google Sheets vždycky ručně upravit na variantu s "nebo".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V tuto chvíli už vše funguje krásně, ale nevzdávám se myšlenky, že by mohlo mít smysl geocoding přece jen lokálně optimalizovat. Napsal jsem si tedy dekorátor pro geocoding funkci, který regulárem odchytá Prahu, Brno a Ostravu, což jsou nejčastější případy, a na tyto rovnou vrátí výsledek, API se vůbec neptá. Když už se ptá, obalí geocoding funkci přes &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.lru_cache"&gt;lru_cache()&lt;/a&gt;, což je asi minimální pomoc, zvlášť když pouštím scrapery v několika procesech vedle sebe, ale zas jako proč ne. Pro mě je to jen pár znaků v kódu navíc a když to odchytá i blbých 5 adres, ušetří to 10 dotazů na API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zbývá vytáhnout data na světlo světa. V rámci continuous deploymentu jsem samozřejmě celou dobu pushoval do masteru a házel vše na produkci, takže už několik dní má výpis nabídek práce štítky o tom, zda je nabídka na dálku, a hned jak jsem byl schopen normalizovat místo, jsem to normalizovaně ihned začal i zobrazovat. Teď ale k tomu hlavnímu, tedy vygenerování samostatných stránek pro jednotlivé regiony. Je pátek a já chtěl končit týden s vítězným pocitem, takže jsem se s tím moc nemazal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vytvořil jsem si pevný seznam regionů, které chci zobrazovat, aby se web neřídil jen tím, co je v databázi, jinak by se stránky regionů náhodně zjevovaly a mizely podle toho, zda v nich zrovna jsou nějaké nabídky práce nebo ne. HTML kód stránek jsem vzal z hlavního výpisu a upravil zatím jen pár popisků. Ošetřil jsem jen případ, kdy v regionu zrovna žádné nabídky nejsou, ale na CSS už nebyl čas. Odkazy na regiony jsem dal zatím ošklivě jen tak pod seznam nabídek. Kdo si tam toho všimne, třeba ho to úplně neurazí a třeba mu to pomůže, než to udělám hezčí. Jo, je to naprasený, ale je to tam a nějak to funguje. Screenshot sem tentokrát ani nebudu dávat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stránky pro jednotlivé regiony fungují i jako SEO lákadlo, takže jsem se pokusil pohrát s tím, aby v &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; stránek bylo něco, co lidi zkouší na internetu hledat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vítězný pocit!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zmatky-a-zachranovani-produkce"&gt;Zmatky a zachraňování produkce&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#zmatky-a-zachranovani-produkce" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Už to tak nějak vyplývá i z popisu toho klikatého postupu výše, ale ne vždy se daří. Mám však ještě jeden příběh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ve středu byl poslední den v měsíci, což znamená, že jsem měl poslat &lt;a href="http://eepurl.com/gyG8Bb"&gt;newsletter&lt;/a&gt;. V podvečer jsem se dostal do fáze, kdy jsem měl jasně funkční geocoding přes OpenStreetMaps a říkám si, že to už jen pushnu a jdu psát ten newsletter. Jenže pak koukám, že to padá, že OSM si neporadí se spoustou adres na produkci. A že mám chyby v tom, jak se na JG inzerátech řeší a ukládá práce na dálku. Všechny JG inzeráty zcela zmizely z výpisu. Zběsile jsem to začal opravovat, ale s každým commitem jsem akorát zbrkle nadělal další chyby, nechal rozbité testy, apod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vždy trvalo, než projde CI, a než zjistím, kde jsem zase přehlédl nějakou chybu. Takže jsem se rozhodl, že v mezičase bych mohl začít připravovat ten newsletter. Sice do něj ani nemůžu ještě dát nabídky práce, když mi zmizely, ale tak nějaký ten text už můžu začít připravovat. Vytvořil jsem v MailChimpu novou kampaň a… rázem mi všechno na CI zase spadlo. Mám totiž na JG skript, který se dívá na MailChimp do kampaní a ukládá informace o tom, jestli byla která nabídka práce už odeslána v nějakém newsletteru a kdy (to se pak posílá v pravidelných informacích inzerentům). Tento skript nepočítal s tím, že existuje kampaň, která nemá datum odeslání :D Takže jsem si akorát přidal další problémy: Kampaň jsem nemohl odeslat, dokud nemám funkční nabídky práce, a ty nebudu mít funkční, dokud bude existovat neodeslaná kampaň. Oprava na jeden řádek, jasně, ale nálada úplně v kýblu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do toho mě donekonečna zlobil &lt;code&gt;pipenv&lt;/code&gt;, protože střídavě z mě neznámého důvodu vytvářel lockfile s knihovnou &lt;code&gt;importlib-metadata&lt;/code&gt; a bez ní, což mi už měsíce (?) střídavě a náhodně shazovalo CI a zasekávalo continuous deployment. V tuto chvíli už jsem vypěnil a zkusil vše přeinstalovat a updatovat, ale bez výsledku. Nakonec jsem zoufale zkusil upgrade projektu z Pythonu 3.7 na 3.8 a to záhadně (zatím!) zabralo. Uf, ok?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nakonec jsem to celé nějak polepil, zachránil, hotfixoval, newsletter dokončil, odeslal a po sedmé večer dokonce s prací i přestal, ale jako… Já nevím no. JG je celé stavěné tak, aby se dalo spravovat v jednom člověku. Když spadne CI, mělo by být jedno, že to opravím až další den. Mělo by být jednoduché udělat revert v Gitu, vrátit se na funkční verzi a nechat opravy na ráno moudřejší večera. Jenže zvyk, že rozbitá produkce je průšvih a musí se řešit hned, je prostě asi silnější. Takhle to ale nejde :) Jsem jeden člověk a nemůžu se nechat stresovat tím, že někde pár hodin přes noc něco na JG chybí. Všem to je úplně jedno a mělo by to nechávat klidného i mě, když vím, že to můžu ráno v klidu opravit. Toto se musím ještě naučit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vylepšil jsem (snad) trochu CSS štítků a log firem u nabídek práce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upravil jsem váhy jednotlivých parametrů, které určují pořadí nabídek. Teď už to vypadá, že výsledek plus mínus dává nějaký smysl.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odepsal jsem na pár mailů a dořešil pár záležitostí, které jsem dlouho odkládal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Díky &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/junior.guru/issues/383"&gt;Mišo Belicovi&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://www.skoumal.com/"&gt;Vláďovi Skoumalovi&lt;/a&gt; jsem se &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1311578638723297280"&gt;dověděl o WAL módu v SQLite&lt;/a&gt; a o tom, &lt;a href="https://www.skoumal.com/en/parallel-read-and-write-in-sqlite/"&gt;jak zapisovat efektivně&lt;/a&gt;. Jak zmínil i &lt;a href="https://github.com/kokes"&gt;Ondřej Kokeš&lt;/a&gt; i v komentářích na FB pod minulými poznámkami, ideálně to řešit přes single writera - udělat lokální frontu, všechno mu posílat a zapisovat bude jen on. To je pro JG momentálně overkill (dělá to tak 10 retries), ale je super, že mi lidi takto radí po přečtení poznámek a rozhodně jsem se díky tomu naučil něco nového.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Byl prodloužený víkend a v pátek jsem programoval do večera, tak jsem si nakonec nechal psaní poznámek až na úterý ráno.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="stranka-s-nabidkami-prace"&gt;Stránka s nabídkami práce&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#stranka-s-nabidkami-prace" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="razeni"&gt;Řazení&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#razeni" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V minulých poznámkách jsem psal, že jsem konečně sjednotil nabídky přímo z JG a nabídky odjinud stažené robotem. Ale že se to řadí nesmyslně a musím to vylepšit. Tak jsem první půlku týdne věnoval tomu řazení a vytvořil skórovací systém, který bere v úvahu:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nějakou tu protekci pro inzeráty přímo z JG,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stáří inzerátu a jejich měsíční obnovování,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;jejich juniornost podle skórovacího systému, který už jsem řešil dříve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lámal jsem si s tím hlavu a nakonec jsem si musel nechat poradit od kamaráda Míly, který má rád šifry, a od bráchy, který se matematiky nebojí tak jako já:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mám seznam ponožek a ty mají nějaké navzájem nesouvisející vlastnosti:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;barvu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;datum uvedení na trh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cenu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chtěl bych je seřadit tak, aby byly řazeny vesměs podle ceny, ale černé ponožky by měly být trochu vejš a taky ty nejnovější, ty by měly dostat v tom řazení výhodu. Neměly by být černé a nové zákonitě první, ale prostě dostat výhodu. Když bude uuuuplne nova červená ponozka, chceš ji dat nějakou šanci, aby mohla prebit černou i levnou. Jak bys to řešil? Vážit umím, ale mám problem s tím, ze ty vlastnosti jsou hrušky a jabka a nevím, jak bych z nich udělal srovnatelná čísla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Řešení je v tom, že si člověk musí ty čísla prostě převést na něco, co srovnat jde. Takže si je vynést na nějakou škálu a zařadit do hodnoty třeba 1 až 100 a potom to může vážit apod. Víc je o tom &lt;a href="https://portal.matematickabiologie.cz/index.php?pg=analyza-a-hodnoceni-biologickych-dat--vicerozmerne-metody-pro-analyzu-dat--vicerozmerna-rozdeleni-pravdepodobnosti--transformace-dat--standardizace-dat"&gt;tady&lt;/a&gt;. Na mě je to větší než malé množství matematiky, ale dalo se to nakonec přežít.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Každopádně ač to zpočátku vypadalo dobře a mechanismus řazení je promakaný, když se na to už pár dní dívám, vůbec s tím spokojený nejsem :D Myslím, že to řazení pořád nedává smysl, takže možná to nakonec zase překopu a možná z toho nebudu dělat &lt;em&gt;rocket science&lt;/em&gt; a prostě udělám &lt;code&gt;.order_by()&lt;/code&gt; podle raz dva tři něčeho a bude to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Někteří inzerenti odjinud si zvyšovali pozornost k inzerátu skrze emoji a už delší dobu mě to tak nějak dráždilo. Hlavně pořád nějak nedůvěřuji emoji jako něčemu, co lze používat volně napříč platformami &lt;a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tech/grimace-face-emoji-causing-awkward-7754205"&gt;bez újmy na přístupnosti a čitelnosti&lt;/a&gt;. Takže jsem emoji &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/junior.guru/blob/master/juniorguru/scrapers/pipelines/emoji_cleaner.py"&gt;odstranil&lt;/a&gt;. Naštěstí to bylo s balíčkem &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/emoji/"&gt;emoji&lt;/a&gt; jednodušší, než jsem čekal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chtěl jsem, aby v novém designu byly u inzerátů loga firem. Získat je z jiných zdrojů nebývá problém, ale nevěděl jsem, co s mými inzeráty na JG. To poslední, s čím jsem se chtěl teď trápit, je umožňovat někomu nahrávat logo k inzerátu, řešit velikost souborů, formáty a kdo ví co ještě. A to ani nezmiňuji, že inzeráty se stále zadávají pomocí Google Forms a celé JG je statický web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Po pár dnech přemýšlení jsem ale dostal nápad, že bych mohl jako logo použít favicon! On totiž dnes favicon není jen taková ta mrňavá ikonka v prohlížeči, ale používá se různě na mobilech apod., takže hodně stránek přímo dává k dispozici přiměřeně velký čtvercový obrázek, v němž je v případě firemních stránek prakticky vždycky jejich logo nebo jiný "projev" brandu. Jako &lt;a href="https://blog.jirichlebus.cz/"&gt;Jirka&lt;/a&gt; by mě asi zabil, ale nedá se nic dělat, &lt;em&gt;startuppyčo&lt;/em&gt;, ideály jdou stranou. Firmy můžou být rády, že tam vůbec nějaké logo bude :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Existuje knihovna &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/favicon/"&gt;favicon&lt;/a&gt;, která ze stránky všechny ikonky vydoluje. Zatím jsem ji použil, ale nevím, jestli jsem s ní plně spokojen. Jednak má v sobě zapečené &lt;a href="https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/"&gt;requests&lt;/a&gt;, takže se to fackuje s asynchronním Scrapy, na kterém robot běží, jednak i ty ikonky hledá trochu divně, nicméně problém to zatím řeší. A výsledky jsou překvapivě dobré! Opravdu jsem nevěděl, jestli tahle strategie vůbec půjde použít, ale vypadá to, že jo. Pak už stačilo jen naučit se s &lt;a href="https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/media-pipeline.html"&gt;Media Pipelines&lt;/a&gt; ve Scrapy a bylo to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ne, samozřejmě nebylo, protože každé logo má jiný tvar, formát, pozadí, no prostě je to svinčík. Naštěstí se tyhle věci dají udělat přes &lt;a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/"&gt;pillow&lt;/a&gt; a když si člověk udělá vlastní Media Pipeline, jde to dost snadno.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ne, nejde to snadno. Půl dne jsem strávil s tím, že jsem nechápal, proč mi to nechce ořezat bílé nebo průhledné pozadí, i když celý internet tvrdí, že ty tři řádky kódu, co tam mám, prostě musí fungovat. Nakonec mě spasilo &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/61815268/325365"&gt;tohle&lt;/a&gt;. Některé obrázky mají alfa kanál, který zmate pillow. Je průhledný, ale pillow si myslí, že to je něco, co se ořezat nehodí. V souvislosti s tím, že jsem chtěl ořezat i bílou, jsem nakonec každý obrázek přeplácl na bílé pozadí, zcela zrušil alfa kanál a do obdélníku ořezal okolí, které bylo jen bílé. Pak z toho dělám ještě čtverec tak akorát pro výpis na stránce a je to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="redesign-nabidkovych-boxu"&gt;Redesign nabídkových boxů&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#redesign-nabidkovych-boxu" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teď už nebránilo nic tomu, abych mohl předělat boxy ve výpisu nabídek práce na něco hezčího. Nakreslil jsem si to na papír, promyslel a předělal. Za pár hodin jsem to měl v pátek po obědě hotové.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="Nabídky práce PŘED" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/nabidky-prace-pred.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;

Vzhled nabídek práce PO&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Díky logům firem to dost prokouklo. Pak jsem se rozhodl ještě pracovat na tom, aby se typy úvazků zobrazovaly jako štítky. Jenže jsem tam narazil na hodně podpovrchové práce a částečně i technického dluhu, takže jsem tuto věc čistil a předělával zbytek pátku a už nezbyl čas ani napsat poznámky. Design štítků je samozřejmě prozatimní a i na celém zbytku stránky hodlám dál pracovat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oprasovani-robota-na-nabidky-prace-odjinud"&gt;Oprašování robota na nabídky práce odjinud&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#oprasovani-robota-na-nabidky-prace-odjinud" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Všiml jsem si pár &lt;em&gt;false positives/negatives&lt;/em&gt; při vyhodnocování nabídek, které zbytečně snižovaly skóre dobrým nabídkám, takže jsem pár takových věcí vyladil. Chtělo by to ale ideálně ladit nějak pravidelně nebo vymyslet nějaký monitoring, těch problémů je tam určitě víc, jen je to ladění časově náročné, tak se mu tolik nevěnuju.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="retries"&gt;Retries&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#retries" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když intenzivně zapisuji do své SQLite databáze, někdy to selže kvůli tomu, že je databáze zamčená. Řešit to nejde, SQLite na intenzivní zápis není dělaná, takže to obcházím, protože mi jinak ve všem vyhovuje. Když zápis selže, zkouším to znovu. Jednak jsem do této mechaniky přidal &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff"&gt;exponential backoff&lt;/a&gt;, jednak jsem ji měl už na dvou místech, tak jsem ji trochu zobecnil a refaktoroval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chtěl jsem, aby čekání na zamčenou databázi nebylo blokující pro &lt;a href="https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy"&gt;Scrapy&lt;/a&gt; (tzn. pro &lt;a href="https://github.com/twisted/twisted"&gt;Twisted&lt;/a&gt;, na kterém je Scrapy postavené), ale nakonec jsem se do toho úplně zamotal a vzdal to. Nejblíž byla asi &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36984696/scrapy-non-blocking-pause"&gt;tato rada&lt;/a&gt;, ale vzhledem k tomu, že to i v této fázi funguje dostatečně (Scrapy pouštím paralelně v několika procesech, takže i když jeden zablokuji, ostatní by měly jet), nechtěl jsem tomu věnovat už víc času.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="monitoring"&gt;Monitoring&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#monitoring" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robot sice funguje, ale někdy nefunguje dokonale, a já to potřebuji vědět. Je tedy pro mě velmi důležité vymyslet správně monitoring a hlavně správné limity na to, aby mi něco spadlo nebo poslalo notifikaci v případě, že se tomu mám věnovat a aspoň to zkontrolovat. Zase mi to nemůže posílat notifikace pořád, jinak vznikne &lt;em&gt;notification fatigue&lt;/em&gt;, tzn. otupím a věnovat se tomu přestanu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zatím to nemám doladěné, ale aspoň jsem vyřešil ukládání statistik z každého scraperu nabídek do databáze. Díky tomu je mohu někde číst nebo na základě čísel shodit CI build. Například pokud jeden zdroj vyprodukuje nula nabídek práce, je to dost podezřelé.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přidal jsem na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/donate/"&gt;seznam podporovatelů&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://github.com/GoodMirek"&gt;Mirka Svobodu&lt;/a&gt;! Díky!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prodloužil jsem za &lt;a href="https://pyvec.org/"&gt;Pyvec&lt;/a&gt; doménu pyladies.cz.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prodloužil jsem možnost přispívání &lt;a href="https://pyvec.org/"&gt;Pyveci&lt;/a&gt; skrz Benevity. Pokud pracujete pro nějakou americkou korporaci jako třeba Oracle, velmi pravděpodobně můžete přes &lt;a href="https://benevity.org"&gt;Benevity&lt;/a&gt; přispívat na různé neziskovky a vaše firma k tomu nějaké peníze ještě přihodí. Výhoda je, že přijde třeba dvojnásobek peněz. Nevýhoda je, že peníze putují do nějakého Benevity UK a z něj potom i přijdou na účet neziskovce, takže si tento příspěvek nemůžete odečíst z daní jako např. u &lt;a href="https://www.darujme.cz/"&gt;darujme.cz&lt;/a&gt;. To lze jen u darů, které směřují do českých neziskovek.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poslal jsem (myslím podruhé za existenci JG) přihlášku do &lt;a href="https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/ats-partners/partner-application"&gt;LinkedIn Talent Solutions Partner&lt;/a&gt;, abych mohl používat jejich rozšířené API, ale moc od toho nečekám. Sice jsem už mohl napsat, že mám mezi klienty např. Red Hat, ale myslím, že mi stejně (zase?) ani neodepíšou.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://ifttt.com/"&gt;IFTTT&lt;/a&gt; mi napsalo, že už nebude zdarma nebo tak něco. Používám to jen jako RSS čtečku (viz &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/how-i-consume-content"&gt;How I consume content&lt;/a&gt;), takže se mi za to nic platit nechce. RSS feedy jsem z toho vytáhl a přemýšlel, kam s nimi. &lt;a href="https://www.integromat.com/"&gt;Integromat&lt;/a&gt; pořád ještě zadarmo je, tak jsem koukal, jestli to mohu přesunout tam. Jenže bych musel vytvořit scénář pro každý RSS feed. To jsem musel i předtím, ale v IFTTT to bylo na tři kliky. Nakonec jsem se rozhodl, že si seznam zdrojů uložím do souboru tady na blogu a dopíšu si &lt;a href="https://docs.getpelican.com/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; plugin, který z toho vygeneruje jeden RSS feed. To je pro mě díky &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/feedparser/"&gt;feedparser&lt;/a&gt; a tomu, že jsem takové věci už dělal, hodně jednoduché. Tento feed potom předhazuji Integromatu a ten mi vše nové posílá do Pocketu. Vyřešeno, snad to bude fungovat. Zároveň jsem smazal &lt;code&gt;comments.py&lt;/code&gt; a v Integromatu vypnul své &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/tydenni-poznamky-cisla-a-e-maily/"&gt;řešení odkazů na komentáře&lt;/a&gt;, protože od září zrušili podporu pro Twitter a já byl líný to řešit. Ty odkazy nemají hodnotu toho času, co bych tím strávil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Už delší dobu jsem měl v plánu udělat si konečně aspoň úplně jednoduchá čísla ohledně příjmů a výdajů. Prostě mít zcela základní přehled o tom, jak se mi daří a odkud plyne kolik příjmů.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pomocí své vlastní knihovny &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/fiobank"&gt;fiobank&lt;/a&gt; jsem měl za jedno dopoledne hotový skript, který mi vytahá transakce z banky a vloží je do Google Sheets. Tohle se teď děje automaticky pravidelně každý den. V Google Sheets mám pak nějaké vzorce a primitivní graf. Zatím stačí. Vydělané peníze jsem rozpočítal na všechny letošní měsíce, tzn. od ledna. Sice jsem "bez práce" už od listopadu, ale řekněme, že do ledna jsem neměl ani ambice nijak vydělávat a dával jsem si něco jako pauzu. Vyšlo mi, že mám zatím čistý měsíční výdělek zhruba 10 000 Kč (nejsou v tom daně, ale je v tom zdrav a soc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="Finance" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/finance.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
Čísla neukážu, ale mám tady výborné koláčky. Vlevo podíly příjmů, vpravo podíly výdajů.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud se v rozumném čase dostanu na nějakých 20-30 000 Kč, budu považovat JG za životaschopné a pracovat na tom dál. Než toto budu ale vyhodnocovat, mám v plánu mnohem víc zapracovat na sales a překopat stránku s nabídkami práce. Zatím je tedy tabulka s grafy spíše orientační, než abych si stanovoval nějaké cíle, termíny, apod. Chtěl jsem prostě jen vědět, jak se zhruba věci mají a kolik je přede mnou ještě práce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="crm"&gt;CRM&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#crm" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jak jsem psal výše, mám v plánu mnohem víc zapracovat na sales. Ideálně dostat se co nejvíc do povědomí firem a recruiterů, aby věděli, že JG vůbec existuje. Zároveň si prostě psát s firmami a prodávat - jak inzerci práce, tak loga na příručce na další měsíce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doteď jsem si psal s pár firmami nebo recruitery, různými kanály (e-maily, LinkedIn messages, FB messages…) a s různým potenciálem to někam dotáhnout. Ale většinou jsem ani nezvládal udělat pořádný follow-up po delší době apod. Navíc jsem vše držel v hlavě a už jsem i zapomínal, kdo je z jaké firmy, nebo na kterém kanálu jsem s kým mluvil. Takže přišel čas na DIY "sales pipeline". Udělal jsem si jednoduché &lt;a href="https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%98%C3%ADzen%C3%AD_vztah%C5%AF_se_z%C3%A1kazn%C3%ADky"&gt;CRM&lt;/a&gt;. Je to další tabulka v Google Sheets, kde mám prostě sloupečky jako název firmy, kontaktní osoba, stav naší komunikace, kde se komunikace vede, atd. Celé jedno odpoledne jsem strávil tím, že jsem z hlavy vytahoval, kde jsem s kým komunikoval, a toto jsem zaznamenával do tabulky. Plus velké množství řádků pro firmy, které bych měl teprve oslovit. Pak jsem si rozplánoval do kalendáře, které dny se chci věnovat sales a marketingu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cílem opět není být největším profesionálem na "customer relationship" a stát se nejlepším internetovým obchodníkem na Žižkově, ale prostě být schopen napsat do pár firem, prodat tam, kde se to nabízí ("low hanging fruit") a nezbláznit se z toho. Do budoucna by se mi samozřejmě líbilo, kdyby se JG prodávalo samo, protože to bude skvělý produkt, ale tam se teprve musím dostat a komunikace s firmami je důležitá věc, kterou nesmím opomíjet a která mě tam dovede.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zároveň musím lépe poznat cílovku. Věnoval jsem několik hodin rešerši toho, "kam chodí" lidé z HR - co je zajímá, jaké mají influencery, na jakých sociálních sítích jsou nejvíc, jaké mají konference, jaké jsou důležité firmy v oboru, atd. Škoda, že jsem to dělal den před tím, než vyšla &lt;a href="https://www.startupjobs.cz/vzdelavani/pruvodce-hr-nejen-pro-juniory"&gt;tahle skvělá příručka pro HR juniory od StartupJobs&lt;/a&gt;, kde je to všechno napsané :D Ale zase mě potěšilo, že se informace tam celkem překrývají s tím, co jsem na koleně sám zjistil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nova-stranka-s-nabidkami-prace"&gt;Nová stránka s nabídkami práce&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#nova-stranka-s-nabidkami-prace" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Udělal jsem &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/junior.guru/permalink/450085692581710/?__cft__%5B0%5D=AZWXv5Y3rLA-8V-LERTjr5LdtflChy3vCamVIp20oogoYab5MDUNO0QkCw69NDZHfU7LBquzztHohOvVrQv4zKB5BEXGIR-ah960G7EYEJGQ9mI5U60vxgwh2SOr9YRM3ZRkW7ztoq4ECtoTRJy44-O-jOS_FDBI1QsD7oudiI6B6FOejyyjC2sRknr3FmyNRH4&amp;amp;__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R"&gt;anketu na FB skupině&lt;/a&gt;, kde lidi mohli hlasovat o tom, co je nejvíc na stránce s nabídkami práce štve. Většinu věcí vím, že jsou problém, ale podle počtu hlasů si teď můžu prioritizovat práci. V rámci příprav jsem si ještě prošel tento &lt;a href="https://the-ux-mini-course.com/"&gt;mini kurz UX&lt;/a&gt;, na který jsem kdysi kdesi narazil. Byl fajn, ale je zaměřený spíš na formuláře a těch já moc nemám a mít nebudu. Den po &lt;a href="https://pyvo.cz/praha-pyvo/2020-09/"&gt;středečním pražském Pyvu&lt;/a&gt; jsem byl funkční jen napůl, tak jsem si jen ujasňoval priority a kreslil, jak by mohly nové nabídky práce vypadat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="Návrh nových nabídek práce" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/nabidky-prace-navrh.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
Kdyby vás zajímalo, jak tyhle věci vznikají…&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Během pátku jsem potom vyřešil první velkou věc, která brzdila další rozvoj této stránky: Sloučil jsem seznam nabídek práce z JG a z externích zdrojů. Už tedy nejsou na stránce dva seznamy, ale jeden, a teď ho mohu začít vylepšovat, nějak chytře řadit, filtrovat, apod. Zdá se to jako blbost, ale byla to dost zásadní změna na backendu JG. Doteď se moje a externí nabídky řešily všude separátně, teď jsem ty svoje vrazil přímo do &lt;a href="https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/item-pipeline.html"&gt;Scrapy pipeline&lt;/a&gt;. Musel jsem popřeházet spoustu souborů, změnit hromady testů, napsat nové, upravit chování na mnoha místech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Výhodou je, že některé informace, které jsem měl jen u externích nabídek, mám teď i u těch svých. Prozatím se nabídky práce řadí podle toho, jak moc se zdají být juniorní, ale moc dobré to není a budu to příští týden vylepšovat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="faux-pas-na-goodreads"&gt;Faux pas na GoodReads&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#faux-pas-na-goodreads" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dělal jsem si pořádek v knížkách a zkusil zase používat &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/"&gt;GoodReads&lt;/a&gt;. Dříve se mě někdo ptal, jestli na GoodReads bude oficiální záznam pro příručku, a má odpověď byla, že asi ne, protože to teď ani nepoužívám. No ale když jsem se k tomu tedy vrátil, &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55336121-p-ru-ka-o-hled-n-prvn-pr-ce-v-it?from_search=true&amp;amp;from_srp=true&amp;amp;qid=GPhvAHV2jx&amp;amp;rank=1"&gt;záznam jsem vytvořil&lt;/a&gt;. Ale hned jsem to schytal, bez nějakého hezkého verzování podle ISBN to tam nepatří. ISBN jsem následně trochu zkoumal a klidně bych to pro příručku nějak vyřešil, ale nemohu se tím momentálně zabývat. Zatím jsem tam zápis nechal. Jestli jste pravidelní uživatelé GoodReads a taky se vám taky nelíbí, že tam příručka je, dejte mi vědět. Pokud vás bude víc a najdu tlačítko smazat, tak to udělám. Jinak to tam počká, než budu moci řešit ISBN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jak jsem trochu tajemně avizoval minule, Fakturoid se mnou udělal rozhovor a dnes v pátek &lt;a href="https://www.fakturoid.cz/blog/2020/09/18/profil-zakaznika-junior-guru"&gt;to vyšlo&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1306877321924808705"&gt;Retweetujte&lt;/a&gt; :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/press/"&gt;press kitu&lt;/a&gt; jsem přidal nějaké fotky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Komunikoval jsem s jedním bootcampem a rozmýšleli jsme, jak si můžeme pomoci. Je to těžké: přednášky pro 20 lidí teď pro mě mají malé ROI, oni mají mezinárodní studenty a JG je jen česky, success stories z jejich stránek jen tak přebrat do nezávislého průvodce nemůžu (protože potom by to nebylo nezávislé a fér vůči jiným bootcampům apod., takže buď tyto přebírat nesmím, nebo se za ně musí transparentně platit, nebo je musím přebrat všechny).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pracoval jsem celé jedno odpoledne na tom, aby o mě napsalo ještě jedno místní internetové médium.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10157716805963862&amp;amp;id=104175623861&amp;amp;anchor_composer=false&amp;amp;ref=m_notif"&gt;Na volné noze se zmínili o JG&lt;/a&gt; na všech svých sociálních sítích. Nemám v tom vůbec prsty, takže mě to velmi potěšilo!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zjistil jsem, že &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1306620863861620739"&gt;do mého telefonu jde česky diktovat&lt;/a&gt; a se ženou jsme to použili k &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1306621571751202819"&gt;přepisování starých cestovatelských deníků&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nevyřešil jsem problém s tím, že nechodí e-maily k mým klientům. Udělal jsem support ticket u &lt;a href="https://sendgrid.com/"&gt;SendGridu&lt;/a&gt;, ale ti mě v podstatě poslali k šípku s tím, že IP adresy se prostě občas na blocklist dostanou a že mám počkat, až se z něj dostane pryč. WTF. I přesto, že mám 100% reputaci, kvůli sdílené odesílací IP nejsou moje e-maily doručeny. Ani upgrade mého účtu to neřeší, musel bych upgradovat o dva tarify výš, abych měl svou vlastní IP, ale platit za to 2000 Kč měsíčně se mi tedy zrovna nechce. Jaké jsou alternativy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pokud byste čistě náhodou měli dojem, že jste oproti mě za uplynulý týden vůbec nic nestihli, tak mám pro vás skvělou zprávu! V klidu se na ten dojem &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/neni-to-zavod/"&gt;můžete vykašlat&lt;/a&gt;. Není zač!&lt;/p&gt;

The transcript is from 2011, but the speech is actually from 2009. It's a very interesting piece, which will make you ponder, so go and read it. The final part, where he advises about clutter, has resonated with me so much I decided I'll make an excerpt of it on my blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it's something everyone already knows thanks to Marie Kondo, but I don't. I have no idea what is Kondo's advice apart from the "DOES IT SPARK JOY?" meme. But from Wikipedia it seems she published her first book in 2011, so Bruce was first anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two notes: The headings are added by me for better orientation. Second, there's also a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dqNPzZUNmg"&gt;recording&lt;/a&gt; of the speech, which I didn't see (yet).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The excerpt follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id="objects-are-print-outs"&gt;Objects are print-outs&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#objects-are-print-outs" title="Permanent link to this heading"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For people of your generation and especially for your children, objects are print-outs. They’re best understood as print-outs. They’re not treasures, they’re not things you want, they’re not things to stockpile, they’re not material wealth, they’re basically frozen social relationships. That’s what these chairs are, and this building, and that duct tape and the rest of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to think of them not in terms of “Oh, I have this pen and I must keep my pen.” You need to think of these objects in terms of hours of time and volumes of space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that sounds very science-fictional, but it’s also a good design approach to it. Because if you’re picking these things up, moving them around, all these possessions, this material clutter in your environment… You’re washing it, you’re storing it, you’re heating it, you’re trying to keep it from its inevitable decay. You’re curating it. You’re looking after it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These possessions are embodied social relationships. They’re all made by people, designed by people, sold by people, promulgated by people, advertised by people. They’re a whole set of relationships that happen to have some particular material form. And it’s not hard for you to get other ones or get new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you can argue that you should economize and just buy cheap things, or try and de-materialize. Not be materialistic, and content yourself with things that are very cheap or very organic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="economizing-is-not-social"&gt;Economizing is not social&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#economizing-is-not-social" title="Permanent link to this heading"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not the way forward. Economizing is not social. When you economize, you’re starving somebody else. Really. If you don’t give them money, they don’t have any money. And if they don’t offer you any money, you don’t get any money. That’s not a social flow, or even a sociable relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you need to do is re-assess the objects in your space and time. And I’m going to explain to you how to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="everyday-objects"&gt;Everyday objects&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#everyday-objects" title="Permanent link to this heading"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The king of objects, the monarch among objects are not fancy objects. They’re not high-tech objects, they’re not organic objects, they’re not biological objects, they’re everyday objects. Things that you’re with every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever is in your time most, what’s taking up most of your time, or in your space most. The stuff that’s closest to your skin, on your skin, inside your skin, in intimate areas. Space and time. That’s what’s going on, that’s where it’s at. That’s where it’s happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common everyday objects. You need to have the best possible common everyday objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bed"&gt;Bed&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#bed" title="Permanent link to this heading"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number one, a bed. You’re spending a third of your life in the thing. You never take it seriously. Rich people have great beds. You should go out and get the best bed you can get. Money is no object. On a per hour rental basis, beds, super important. The sheets, the pillows, pretty high up there too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every morning when you wake up you will thank me for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know you’re resisting it. It’s like: “Why? Why am I buying a fancy bed? It’s bad for me, I’m being taken outside of my comfort zone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You live in the thing! Get rid of the wedding china! Get rid of the tuxedos! The exercise equipment you never use! The things you never touch! The heaps of things, the heaps of material objects in your closet and, God help you, your storage locker. Sell them all, buy a bed. Get a real bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="chair"&gt;Chair&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#chair" title="Permanent link to this heading"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get a chair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shouldn’t have to tell people who work with computers to get a chair. No, they’d rather whine about their wrists blowing out, their spines blowing out. They wouldn’t come up with a chair that would cost them maybe fifteen cents an hour over the first amortizable period. The world is full of beautifully designed ergonomic chairs. Get a real damn chair!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sell the other chairs, the fancy chairs, the couch, the over-stuffed thing, your grandmother’s chair. Get rid of your grandmother’s chair, it was never properly built to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get rid of it. Get rid of it, if you don’t use it! If you haven’t touched it in a year, get rid of it immediately. Sell it, buy real things you really use. 00:35:08-7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="real-stuff"&gt;Real stuff&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#real-stuff" title="Permanent link to this heading"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you’re going to have a lot fewer things, but the actual quality of your life will skyrocket! If you have real shoes. Real underwear. Women, if you use actual cosmetics instead of shoplifting cheap cosmetics, because you’re deeply conflicted about your impulses. Go ahead, it’s on your lips, it’s on your eyelids, get real cosmetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="four-variety-of-items"&gt;Four variety of items&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#four-variety-of-items" title="Permanent link to this heading"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to explain to you how you do this, because it’s a hard karma. I’ve done it three times, I’m an author, I’m pursued by books, things accumulate. Periodically I have to scrape the barnacles off, but it’s doable. It’s doable and it’s very hackerly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First you need to make lists. Hackers love lists. A chart. You can make a flowchart. Flowchart it if it makes you any happier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four variety of items: Beautiful things; emotionally important things; tools, devices and appliances that efficiently perform some useful function; and category four, everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me repeat these four things. Number one: beautiful things. Number two: things that have some emotional meaning for you. Number three: your tools, devices and appliances. Number four: everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="beautiful-things"&gt;Beautiful things&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#beautiful-things" title="Permanent link to this heading"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you know if it belongs in category number one, beautiful things? Beautiful things are very important. Is it so beautiful that you’re going to show it to your friends? Is it on display? Are you going to share its beauty with people in your immediate area? Your wife, your husband, your drinking buddies, your pals, the techno DJ from downstairs, whatever. Is it so beautiful that you’re driven to exhibit it, to show it off and to share it with others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not that beautiful? It’s not beautiful! Gotta go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take its picture. Make sure you get the bar code, if for some reason you want it back. Just virtualize it, put it in your thumb drive. It does not belong in your immediate vicinity. You weren’t born with it, you’re not going to die with it, it’s gotta go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="emotionally-important-things"&gt;Emotionally important things&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#emotionally-important-things" title="Permanent link to this heading"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number two, emotionally important. Okay, we’re all the slaves of our objects. You’re going to be in there, you’re going to think: “Oh yeah, Sterling says I should annotate and catalogue my stuff, and remove the things that are basically enslaving me! Oh, but not this! Not you, not you, beloved little pancake-turner!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you know if it’s emotionally important? Are you going to tell anybody else about it? “This is your grandfather’s watch, son. He wore this, and I’ve worn it too, and it should be for you. Look at how well made it was. He carried this in battle, he fought for our freedom, look, there’s bloodstains on this watch.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does it have a narrative? Is there something you want to tell other people about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or are you actually its slave? Is it just emotionally blackmailing you because you’re used to having it around? If you can’t tell anybody about it, there’s no associated story, and it has no possible emotional meaning for anybody else but you, it doesn’t really mean anything to you. Get rid of it, you’ll never miss it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take its picture first. Catalogue everything about it. You might want to write down a story, the way it made you feel. It’s all right. You can get another one. Plenty of junk on eBay. It’s just going to sit there, you can click it, you can have it, it’s not hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great-grandfather couldn’t do that: got no eBay. Get it out of your vicinity. Stop dusting it off, stop heating it up, stop paying for it. Just get it away!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="your-tools"&gt;Your tools&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#your-tools" title="Permanent link to this heading"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there’s your tools, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re losing nothing by getting rid of these things. They have no real meaning for you. You are gaining time and light and space and health by removing these objects from your vicinity. They’re social relationships imposed on you by other people. There are powerful forces that put those there for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tools — okay, high technical standards. I don’t have to preach to you about this. Be very demanding of these tools. Do not make do with broken stuff. You’re going to meet lots of Hairshirt Greens, they’ll say, “Oh, it’s perfectly good! Look, it’s only a little bit splintery! Put some duct tape on it, it’s fine!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not make do with broken stuff. There’s nothing more materialistic than doing the same job five times because your tools are inferior. You should understand this, you should be trying to reward best practices from people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go out and buy real stuff! Stuff that functions. You’re knowledgeable people in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="your-tools-as-gadgets"&gt;Your tools as gadgets&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#your-tools-as-gadgets" title="Permanent link to this heading"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, you have to look out for time-sucking beta-rollout crap. Because that’s the dark side of your tool fixation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you really experimenting with this stuff? You’ll claim that, “Oh look, it’s nice, I think I’d better get it, it might be useful! I’ve got its sisters and its brothers. It’s marked down! It must be in my home.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, are you really “experimenting”? How do you know if you’re really experimenting? You’re working on it methodically and you’re publishing the results! It’s not an experiment if you don’t publish the results in some verifiable and falsifiable form, okay?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I just needed it. No, no, it was mine, mine, mine, me, the shiny tech-boy jackdaw! I had to, like, have it. In my underwear drawer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re not telling other people about it, you’re not experimenting with it! You’re enslaved by the thing. Put down the shiny gadget, go look in the shiny mirror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re experimenting, you’ve got to be sharing the knowledge. Just put it out there, be brave! Be brave. Tell other people. Share it, or stop it! 00:41:28-3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="everything-else"&gt;Everything else&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#everything-else" title="Permanent link to this heading"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And everything else. Category four, everything else. Virtualize it, store the data, get rid of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tons of stuff. Tons of stuff! You’re going to need help. You’re going to be crying hot bitter tears about this one. Number four, colossal category. Probably 80 percent of whatever’s in your immediate vicinity. It’s going to arrive like barnacles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a hard discipline. It’s a hard thing to do, really hard. It’s not the sort of thing you do on impulse after you leave a tech conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the sort of thing you do when a spouse dies. It’s the sort of thing you do when you move to another city. It’s the sort of thing you do when a child is born, or a child leaves your home. It’s the sort of thing you do after a divorce. You have to pick a moment when you can cleave into it, because it’s tough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not a thing to do on impulse. I don’t urge you to do it right now. I urge you to think about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think you should go home, catalogue what you’ve got, morally prepare yourself for this moment. Because it’s going to come. It comes in everybody’s lives. It’s going to come in yours, probably a lot more often in your lives than the lives of people whose lives are going to be a little less turbulent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you’re morally prepared for it, it’ll actually help you lessen the shock. You’ll be like, “Okay, I’m ready. This moment, I’ve been plotting and scheming about this, the moment where I rid myself of this dross and come face to face with some more authentic version of myself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not going to hurt you to lose all these things. You don’t need them. After you go through this particular discipline, you will look different, you will act differently. You will become much more what you already are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category></entry><entry><title>Týdenní poznámky: Média a metriky z příručky</title><link href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/tydenni-poznamky-media-a-metriky-z-prirucky/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-09-11T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2020-09-11T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Honza Javorek</name></author><id>tag:honzajavorek.cz,2020-09-11:/blog/tydenni-poznamky-media-a-metriky-z-prirucky/</id><summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utekl další týden (7.9. — 11.9.) a tak &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/tydenni-poznamky-uverejneni-prirucky/"&gt;stejně jako minule&lt;/a&gt; sepisuji, co jsem dělal a co zajímavého jsem se naučil.

&lt;h2 id="media"&gt;Média&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#media" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minulý týden jsem zakončil bláznivým pátkem, kdy spousta lidí našla příručku po &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/spazef0rze/status/1301773489041371136"&gt;retweetu&lt;/a&gt; Michala Špačka a po publikaci zpráviček na Lupě, Rootu a Zdrojáku. Zároveň jsem finalizoval tiskovku.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V pondělí jsem udělal poslední úpravy na tiskovce. Přečetl jsem si všechno možné na &lt;a href="https://prtipy.cz/"&gt;PR tipech&lt;/a&gt; a zjistil jednu zásadní věc: Nepotřebuji tiskovou zprávu :D Tisková zpráva je hromadný spam do schránek redakcí, kterým firma dává najevo, že existuje, a udržuje nějaký &lt;em&gt;heartbeat&lt;/em&gt; informací o sobě, kdyby je náhodou někdo potřeboval. Není to ale způsob, jak novinářům říct, aby o vás něco napsali. Cituji &lt;a href="https://prtipy.cz/2018/06/30/posilame-tiskove-zpravy-a-nemame-z-nich-vystupy-jak-je-to-mozne-a-co-s-tim-075/"&gt;PR tip&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S novináři musíte komunikovat přímo, připravit pro ně unikátní témata, dát jim to, co zrovna potřebují. Hovořit s nimi o věcech, které jsou podstatné, nové, zajímavé a mají smysl pro jejich čtenáře. K tomu tiskové zprávy neslouží.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To dává perfektní smysl, že? Čím spíš novinářům naservíruji nějaké unikátní, zajímavé téma, tím spíš z toho udělají článek. A TZ je z definice unifikovaná zpráva, která se rozesílá na tunu adres, takže jde úplně proti tomu. Tak jsem se zase něco nového naučil! Aspoň nemusím být smutný, že &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/press/handbook/"&gt;moje TZ&lt;/a&gt; podle některých není dost profesionální. (Ale že je podle některých na první TZ prý docela dobrá, to si samozřejmě někam zarámuju.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, když už jsem tu TZ měl, tak jsem tedy v pondělí ještě zapracoval všechny připomínky a večer rozeslal na všechny možné adresy. Moc jsem od toho nakonec nečekal, takže jsem použil prakticky stejný "media list" co minule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abych ale nezůstal jen u toho, že TZ je na nic, jal jsem se řídit radou z PR tipů a napsal osobně pár novinářům, jestli by neměli zájem o exkluzivní obsah, který jsem schopný nějak dodat nebo konzultovat. To nějakou odezvu mělo, jestli se to promění i ve hmatatelné výsledky, to se ještě uvidí. TZ se mi v tomto případě hodila jako poznámka pod čarou - mimoděk jsem mohl zmínit, že jsem něco vydal a do závorky napsat, že detaily jsou tady v tiskovce. Takže třeba úplně k ničemu nakonec nebyla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I přes to všechno díky všem, kteří mi s TZ pomohli. I když si příště rozmyslím, zda něco jako TZ potřebuji, bylo to velmi poučné cvičení a rozhodně užitečná lekce jak vůbec psát něco, co by mohl chtít číst někdo, kdo to číst nechce. Já jsem totiž zvyklý psát jen věci, kde předpokládám dobrovolné zaujetí čtenáře už díky vybranému tématu :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="metriky-z-prirucky"&gt;Metriky z příručky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#metriky-z-prirucky" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Během čtvrtka jsem neměl žádné pochůzky ani telefonáty, takže jsem ráno radostně usedl k počítači a odlepil se od něj až večer. Tento nepřerušovaný čas jsem věnoval velkému nápřahu co nejrychleji zhotovit posílání statistik zobrazování sponzorských log na příručce a klikání na ně.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Věděl jsem, že se mi to moc dělat vlastně nechce a že bych to prokrastinoval, tak jsem se rozhodl, že to tedy udělám co nejdřív, ať to mám prostě z krku, i když na to mám ještě skoro měsíc. No a za jeden den bylo vymalováno. Byl to kód dost podobný tomu, co už mám pro pracovní inzeráty, takže nic velice náročného.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Informace o sponzorech mám teď v Google Spreadsheets, kde je mohu snadno upravovat a mám tam i informace, jako kolik kdo platí apod. Odtud se hezky stáhnou do SQLite a přidají se k nim data o proklicích a návštěvnosti z Google Analytics. Loga se nově vypisují na příručku z SQLite (kdo má delší tarif, zobrazí se dřív, potom se to řadí podle data začátku sponzoringu), předtím tam byly prostě natvrdo ručně vepsané do HTML. Posílání mailů jsem vyčlenil do samostatného workflow v CI, aby nehrozilo, že mi spadne nightly, já udělám retry a pošle se klientům duplicitní várka mailů. Teď to bude hezky padat každé zvlášť :) No a mám hotovo, už stačí jen počkat do 1.10. na první várku, protože statistiky ze sponzoringu se budou posílat měsíčně. Všechno mám samozřejmě hezky otestované.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Počítání návštěvnosti pro loga bylo zajímavé, protože mám samozřejmě jen data o tom, kolik lidí si zobrazilo příručku. To je totožné se zobrazením loga, ale každé logo je na příručce jen v určitém časovém období, a v tom je ten rozdíl. Takže stahuji informace o návštěvnosti pro každé jednotlivé datum a potom dělám pro každé logo sumu čísel za interval, kdy bylo zobrazeno na příručce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Práci na statistikách o tom, kdo chodí z jakého regionu, jsem zatím pozastavil. Chce to jen jeden klient a bylo by to hodně kódu. Nejdřív počkám a uvidím, jestli je to opravdu tak strašně potřeba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://scrapy.org/"&gt;Scrapy&lt;/a&gt; udělalo nějaké změny, které způsobovaly "deprecation warnings" v kódu robota na nabídky práce. Opravil jsem to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odstranil jsem PayPal ze &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/donate/"&gt;stránky, kde prosím o příspěvek&lt;/a&gt;. Za celou dobu jej použil jeden člověk. Většina lidí, kteří mi chtějí něco poslat jednorázově, zvolí přímou platbu na účet. Kdo mě chce podporovat dlouhodobě, má možnost v podobě GitHub Sponsors nebo Patreonu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2x mentoring session.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Schůze výboru &lt;a href="https://pyvec.org/"&gt;Pyvce&lt;/a&gt;. Konečně jsme obnovili schůzování po koroně, v létě jsme na to trochu kašlali. Probrali jsme pár drobností a shodli jsme se, že bychom se možná časem mohli odvážit i naučit se konečně svolávat členskou schůzi, &lt;a href="https://docs.pyvec.org/operations/runbooks.html#jak-clenstvi"&gt;když už teď máme i ty členy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PyLadies kurzy v Praze budou mít na podzim i běh v nějaké online podobě a k tomu si zakládají dedikovanou FB skupinu (každý běh má svoji jen pro lidi z daného běhu). Poprosili mě, abych doplnil obrázek pro záhlaví skupiny, takže &lt;a href="https://github.com/pyvec/resources/blob/master/Design/Facebook%20Group%20Headers/pyladies-praha-online.png"&gt;tady je&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Řešíme, proč jednomu inzerentovi nechodí maily se statistikami. Vypadá to, že nějaká náhodná IP adresa SendGridu se dostala na náhodný spam list a jejich firma ty maily nepustí dovnitř. Zatím ping pong s jejich technickou podporou.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poněkolikáté se mi stalo, že jsem zapomněl zaznamenat datum, kdy jsem určité inzeráty rozeslal v newsletteru. Přišel jsem na to až když jsem kontroloval maily se statistikama pro inzerenty, ve kterých tato informace je. A byla tam špatně. Takže jsem se už naštval a naprogramoval skript, který z MailChimp API stáhne informace o obsahu newsletterů, najde v nich odkazy na inzeráty, a do databáze uloží údaje o tom, která nabídka práce byla ve kterém newsletteru odeslána. Pryč s manuální prací! Teď už se bude vše dít automaticky a nemusím na to myslet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zmizelo video Cala Newporta z Vimeo.com a rozbilo mi to odkaz. Po dlouhé době byl můj skript na kontrolu odkazů opravdu užitečný a ne jen otravný. Našel jsem naštěstí &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUQjAAwsKR8"&gt;podobné video na YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. U této příležitosti jsem si jej i pustil a &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/junior.guru/commit/c4eee432dae8f8098e7e086706329b1813a6e25b"&gt;přepsal závěr příručky&lt;/a&gt;, aby nebyl tak moc ezo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/hire-juniors/"&gt;stránku pro firmy&lt;/a&gt; jsem přidal logo Root.cz do místa, kde jsou média, která někde zmínila JG. Můj skill s Inkscape je každým dnem mnohem lepší!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V pátek jsem měl hovor s Lukášem z &lt;a href="https://www.fakturoid.cz/"&gt;Fakturoidu&lt;/a&gt; o tom, že bychom společně něco mohli připravit. Potom jsem strávil nějakou tu hodinu tím, že jsem připravoval tu svou část. Víc prozrazovat zatím nebudu.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id="prirucka-je-venku"&gt;Příručka je venku&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#prirucka-je-venku" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.9., tedy v pondělí před půlnocí, jsem uveřejnil příručku. Vše jsem si připravil předem, takže v den uveřejnění jsem se tím ani tolik nezabýval a před spaním akorát z mobilu mergnul &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/junior.guru/pull/361"&gt;tenhle Pull Request&lt;/a&gt;. Kdo je pozornější, jistě si všimne, že příručka byla celou dobu na webu, jen na tajné adrese a kdokoliv si ji mohl z GitHubu dávno přečíst. Dokonce i tajný náhled pro lidi z newsletteru fungoval akorát tak, že jsem lidi poprosil, ať to zatím nešíří. Statické stránky, žádné heslo, žádné složitosti. Tolik k tomu, že vám všichni ukradnou texty, nápady, nebo že na GitHubu se vám někdo dívá pod ruce. Pokud nejste slavní, všem je úplný šumák, co děláte, dokud tomu neuděláte pořádnou reklamu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prvního jsem šel a nasdílel vydání příručky do 19 skupin na FB, na Twitter, na LinkedIn, na Instagram. Prošel jsem relevantní Slacky, ve kterých jsem, a hodil to i tam. Pro každé místo, kam jsem příručku sdílel, jsem vymyslel unikátní text, který se pro danou skupinu nejvíc hodil. Samozřejmě předmětem sdělení bylo vždy totéž, takže jsou podobné, ale přišlo mi, že to takto dává největší smysl, nechtěl jsem jen copy-pastovat a tapetovat nějakým spamem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V pátek ráno jsem myslel, že je po všem a že si budu už jen hrát se psaním tiskové zprávy, ale můj tweet ráno &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/spazef0rze/status/1301773489041371136"&gt;poslal dál&lt;/a&gt; Michal Špaček svým 10 000 followerům a to spustilo úplně novou vlnu zájmu, retweetů, připomínek, atd., takže během pátku jsem vůbec nevěděl co dělat dřív, byl to hukot. I tyhle poznámky píšu až teď v neděli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tiskovka"&gt;Tiskovka&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#tiskovka" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Původně jsem nechtěl psát žádným médiím a řekl jsem si, že &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1296808683419193345"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; buďto bude stačit, nebo na to prostě kašlu. V dubnu jsem psal úplně všem možným médiím a byla to spousta úplně zbytečně vynaloženého času. Jenže teď jsem si vzpomněl, že na Root, Zdroják a Lupu se dá poslat zprávička přes formulář a oni to případně jen upraví a schválí. Otevřel jsem si formulář a uvědomil si, že potřebuju napsat text, který se nápadně podobá slohovému útvaru tisková zpráva a touto salámovou metodou jsem se teda dostal k tomu, že jsem ji nakonec přece jenom začal psát. První verzi jsem udělal podle &lt;a href="https://cesko.digital/assets/tiskova-zprava.pdf"&gt;TZ Česko.Digital&lt;/a&gt;, kterou linkují z patičky. Poslal jsem ji do CzechCrunche, abych se jim připomenul, a kámošovi, jestli na ni nemrknou jeho kámošky se zkušenostmi z PR. Taky jsem udělal &lt;a href="http://junior.guru/press"&gt;stránku pro média&lt;/a&gt; a odeslal ty zprávičky. Dvě publikovali prakticky hned, Lupa si dala trochu na čas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V pátek ráno jsem &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1301766194425462784"&gt;zkusil&lt;/a&gt; na Twitteru a LinkedIn otestovat, zda je TZ k ničemu, nebo ji můžu začít rozesílat. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/"&gt;Levels&lt;/a&gt; se radí se svým Twitterem o všem možném, tak mi to přišlo jako dobrý nápad. Reakce jsem dostal rozporuplné, na jednu stranu dobré rady a tipy jak to vylepšit, kde si přečíst &lt;a href="https://prtipy.cz/"&gt;tipy o PR&lt;/a&gt; nebo &lt;a href="http://prciny.com/"&gt;jakou knížku si koupit&lt;/a&gt;. Na druhou stranu se našli lidi, kteří mi naznačili, že toto je amatérský přístup, který dlouhodobě fungovat nebude a že bych si na to měl prostě někoho najít, ať už dobrovolníka nebo zaplatit. Dokud nenarazím do zdi, budu "solopreneur" a budu se radit s lidmi na Twitteru. Uvidíme :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Každopádně hned ráno mi Daniel Dočekal odpověděl, že TZ v PDF by ani neotevřel, že to je nejhorší formát. Takže jsem hned sedl a za hoďku to celé předělal na HTML stránky. Neuvědomil jsem si, že jsem tím ale rozbil odkaz na PDF, takže CzechCrunch i kámoš mi hned psali, že odkaz nefunguje :D Ale fajn bylo, že ani CzechCrunch, ani kámoše to neodradilo od toho se mnou něco podnikat, takže dobrý. Spolu s CzechCrunch nakonec něco asi vymyslíme a od kámoše, resp. kámošky kámoše, mi přišlo hodně dobrých připomínek, jak vylepšit tiskovou zprávu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na tu mám ještě feedback, který jsem nestačil zpracovat. Dodělám v pondělí a pak už to rozešlu, ať je to jaké chce. Ještě upřímně ani nevím kam. Těžko říct, jestli se orientovat podle toho seznamu z dubna, tam byla mizerná odezva.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="prvni-vysledky"&gt;První výsledky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#prvni-vysledky" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Od 1.9. do 6.9. mám 4000 návštěvníků a skoro 6000 zobrazení.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kolik lajků jsem dostal na těch 19 FB skupinách asi nikdy nespočítám, ale několik dní jsem měl notifikace v jednom ohni. K dnešnímu dni má &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1300721910238654464"&gt;tweet o příručce&lt;/a&gt; 71 RT a 137 lajků. Analytika na Twitteru udává 14000 "impresí" a 1500 interakcí.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nekonečně mnoho pozitivních ohlasů od cílovky, tedy juniorů, ať už soukromými nebo veřejnými kanály.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;S příručkou jsem se dostal víc do povědomí v Czechitas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Z více stran z Czechitas zaznělo, že budou příručku doporučovat. Totéž jsem slyšel z ENGETO Academy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ozval se mi jeden bootcamp.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jedna nová &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/hire-juniors/#handbook"&gt;poptávka na logo na příručce&lt;/a&gt;, kterou jsem hned zprocesoval a vyfakturoval.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dva noví podporovatelé na GitHub Sponsors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jeden podporovatel na Patreonu zvýšil příspěvek.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celkem 500 Kč v dobrovolných příspěvcích jednorázově přímou platbou na můj účet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nesčetně připomínek na vylepšení nebo rozšíření příručky, které jsem si zapsal. Pár drobností jsem rovnou udělal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Různými kanály mi napsali lidé, kteří chtěli s něčím poradit. Zatím jsem se všem snažil odpovědět a poradit, bez toho, abych na to dával cenovku. Ostatně, každý mi může &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/donate/"&gt;něco poslat dobrovolně&lt;/a&gt;, pro mě je to tak teď jednodušší, než se zaseknout na vymýšlení nějaké hodinovky na konzultace, když ani nevím, jak často se tohle bude dít.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Je to úspěch? Jaký byl původní záměr s příručkou? Na začátku tohoto roku jsem si uvědomil, že na JG chodí dvě různé cílovky, a to lidi, kteří se chtějí naučit programovat, a lidi, kteří si chtějí hledat svou první práci v IT. Samozřejmě se překrývají, ale zatímco tu první nemohu se svým současným byznys modelem monetizovat, ta druhá je vlastně moje opravdová cílovka, pokud mě mají živit firmy a nabídky práce. Příručka tedy měla JG víc zacílit na tyto lidi, stáhnout jich na JG co nejvíc a vytvořit jim důvod tam chodit, doporučovat si tuhle stránku mezi sebou, apod. Zároveň jsem pak chtěl kultivovat juniory v ČR samotným obsahem příručky a mít možnost firmám říct, že junioři, kteří se naučili programovat díky JG, jsou kvalitní materiál, jenž chodí na pohovory připraven. To vše si myslím, že se tak nějak povedlo a ještě jako bonus jsem sehnal na příručku sponzory a dokázal lidi přesvědčit, že mě mají podporovat na GitHub Sponsors nebo Patreonu. Za úspěch to tedy považuji.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I když… Do Dobrého rána s Českou televizí jsem se s tím zatím nedostal. Ale to je asi dobře, protože vlastně nerad vstávám brzo ráno.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="priprava-socialnich-siti"&gt;Příprava sociálních sítí&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#priprava-socialnich-siti" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Než jsem vydal příručku, prošel jsem si svůj profil na Twitteru, LinkedIn a na Facebooku, abych měl všude v "about" věci, které dávají smysl a aby byl všude jasný odkaz na JG, kdyby si mě někdo lustroval nebo kdybych zaujal nějaké novináře, tak aby bylo propojení mé osoby a JG jednoznačné. Taky je to reklama na JG vůči lidem, kteří z nějakého důvodu objeví dřív můj profil než samotné JG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taky jsem si rozmyslel název &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/junior.guru/"&gt;FB skupiny&lt;/a&gt;. Ten jde měnit snad jen jednou za 100 nebo kolik dní. S tím aktuálním jsem nebyl spokojený, takže jsem jej změnil a myslel hlavně na klíčová slova, aby skupinu našel na FB třeba někdo, kdo hledá něco pro začátečníky v programování, ale i lidi, kteří přímo hledají JG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do této chvíle jsem se bránil tomu, abych měl pro JG samostatnou FB stránku, existovala jen zmíněná skupina. Nechci tvořit žádný obsah na FB nebo na jiné sociální síti, vše chci směřovat na své domény honzajavorek.cz a junior.guru, kde mám nad obsahem kontrolu a nejsem otrokem cizích algoritmů. Nechci, aby pro obsah lidi chodili na FB, chci aby chodili na mé weby, a to ideálně přímo, bez prostředníků.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Také jsem nechtěl trávit čas hloupostmi, proto třeba JG nemá vlastní Twitter účet. Na Twitteru ani není většina cílovky, dělal bych tam srandičky pro pár fanoušků a to je raději nechám sledovat můj vlastní účet. FB skupinu jsem založil jen na zkoušku, jako místo pro setkávání případné komunity a jako kanál, kam případně mohu automaticky posílat nabídky práce těm, kdo netouží odebírat newsletter, ale FB jim vyhovuje. Instagram jsem založil spíš ze srandy, abych si s tou sítí mohl hrát.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To by asi stačilo pro kontext :D Prostě jsem se doteď bránil samostatné FB page, ale jednak jsem zjistil, že pokud si chci dát JG jako povolání na FB, musí mít vlastní stránku, jednak jsem narazil už dřív na hodně překážek, pokud tu FB stránku nemám (připojení &lt;a href="https://publish.buffer.com/"&gt;Bufferu&lt;/a&gt; na Instagram, mimo jiné). Takže jsem ji nakonec &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/juniordotguru"&gt;vytvořil&lt;/a&gt; a propojil s ní i původní skupinu. Můžete ji olajkovat, ale je mi to dost jedno, protože tam stejně jako v případě &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/26218444/"&gt;LinkedIn stránky&lt;/a&gt; nic psát asi nebudu a nikde ji nebudu propagovat. Jmenuje se Junior Guru, protože FB nedovolí začít název stránky malým písmenem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kdo chce vědět novinky o JG, ať sleduje newsletter nebo přímo mě, nebudu si hrát na deset profilů. Buduju si image tvůrce téhle služby a nechci trávit přehršel času správou profilů na sociálních sítích, ROI by podle mě bylo fakt hodně špatné. Stačí, že se starám o &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kredenecek"&gt;@kredenecek&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nazev-junior-guru"&gt;Název Junior Guru&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#nazev-junior-guru" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Už dřív jsem někde četl, že novináři a jiní běžní lidi mají velký problém s názvem, který se píše stylizovaně bez velkých písmen. Ani ten blbý Facebook nedovolí udělat stránku bez počátečního velkého písmena. Takže jsem se rozhodl, že v těchto kontextech budu JG psát jako Junior Guru, i když se mi to nelíbí a byl bych nejraději, kdyby se to všude jmenovalo a psalo junior.guru.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="statistiky-tykajici-se-prirucky"&gt;Statistiky týkající se příručky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#statistiky-tykajici-se-prirucky" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hned tento týden jsem začal průběžně připravovat skript, který z Google Analytics stahuje statistiky o příručce, abych je mohl posílat sponzorům příručky. Do toho si jeden inzerent přál, aby mu chodilo odkud lidi chodí na jeho nabídky práce, takže jsem řešil, jak to jde udělat. GA mají "dimenzi" region, což jsem nakonec zhodnotil jako nejlepší data v tomto ohledu, jelikož město není úplně relevantní (inzerentovi je celkem jedno, jestli lidi chodí z Brna, Adamova, nebo Ivančic, spíš mu jde o to, jestli lidi chodí z Jižní Moravy nebo z Prahy). Ještě to ale nemám hotové.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Původně se mi návštěvnost na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/hire-juniors/"&gt;stránce pro firmy&lt;/a&gt; počítala průměrně za poslední 4 kalendářní měsíce, ale toto se mi přestalo líbit, jelikož čísla z příručky by se v tom objevila až v říjnu. Proto jsem to trochu překopal a teď se to počítá pohyblivě od včerejšího dne mínus 4 měsíce a denní návštěvnost se přepočítává aby byla za měsíc. K něčemu ta matematika ze ZŠ nakonec přece jenom byla. Pak jsem to ale musel ještě opravit, protože si to původně neporadilo s tím, kdyby chyběly data pro nějaké dny, dělilo se počtem řádků v datech, ne počtem dní v rozsahu. Toto jsem zjistil hlavně když jsem pak začal podobné statistiky počítat u příručky, kde samozřejmě za poslední 4 měsíce nic není, jen za posledních pár dní.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tyto statistiky pro příručku jsem pak co nejdřív &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/hire-juniors/#handbook"&gt;zobrazil na stránce pro firmy&lt;/a&gt;: počet návštěvníků příručky, počet zobrazení sponzorských log, počet kliknutí na sponzorská loga a konverzi. Ještě budu potřebovat čísla pro jednotlivá loga, která bych firmám posílal e-mailem jako report, to musím teprve dodělat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Přidal jsem na totéž místo i "testimonials", tedy ohlasy na příručku. Začalo jich být brzy tolik, hlavně z Twitteru, že už nebylo moc dobré je zobrazovat vedle sebe. Vynalezl jsem tedy nějaké překlikávátko. Asi nic úžasného, ale prostě jsem to nějak narychlo vymyslel, aby to nějak fungovalo. Ohlasy jsem ani nestíhal přidávat, tak jsou zatím v úplně náhodném pořadí.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Napsal jsem Romea o &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/outreachy/status/1299378068218241024?s=12"&gt;stipendiích vypisovaných v Outreachy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Den před vydáním příručky jsem ještě poslal newsletter, protože byl konec měsíce. Tam jsem opět zdůraznil, že "zítra" to vyjde.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Víc lidí mě upozornilo, že neexistuje odkaz na příručku z hlavní stránky. Dal jsem ho do proužku s upozorněním, ale jinak jsem to neřešil. Příručka teď podle mě nepotřebuje podporu z hlavní stránky, všichni teď chodí na JG kvůli ní a je to mnohem větší "landing page" než samotná hlavní stránka. Budu spíš rád, když díky příručce lidi objeví zbytek JG, případ že by na JG hledali příručku je podle mě minoritní. Původně jsem myslel, že dám odkaz na příručku místo tlačítka "Nabídky do e-mailu", ale podle Google Analytics má toto tlačítko největší konverzi lidí zapsaných do newsletteru, takže na to peču. Třeba to udělám, až bude návštěvnost na příručce uvadat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hned po vydání si víc lidí stěžovalo, že žluté bloky "Nepřehlédni" působí jako patička a že je to mate, že mají pocit, že už skončila stránka, i když by končit ještě neměla. Urychleně jsem to tedy upravil na něco, co není široké jako celá stránka a co má mnohem neutrálenější barvu. Snad to i tak lidi nepřehlédnou… Aspoň dočtou příručku do konce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Před vydáním příručky jsem prošel a trochu upravil &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/honzajavorek"&gt;profil na Patreonu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Konečně se mi povedlo na macOS nainstalovat Inkscape a dal jsem mu novou šanci. Kupodivu celkem funguje a daří se mi v něm s trochou hledání na internetu upravovat SVG jak potřebuji. &lt;a href="https://github.com/rectorphp/getrector.org/pull/173/"&gt;Vytvořil jsem tak i logo nového sponzora na příručce&lt;/a&gt; :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vystavil jsem už předem sjednané dvě nabídky práce od Red Hatu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během toho všeho jsem ještě stihl 2x mentoring session.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upravil jsem skript kontrolující pokažené odkazy, aby ignoroval různé typy chyb, které nemůžu ovlivnit, a které mi v poslední době shazovaly CI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Všiml jsem si, že jména podporovatelů se neřadí správně podle příjmení, protože to nezvládá české řazení podle háčků apod. Použil jsem tedy &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/czech-sort/"&gt;czech-sort&lt;/a&gt; v Pythonu, protože se mi nepovedlo zjistit, jak to udělat s SQLite a Peewee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Musím dodělat statistiky příručky a jejich posílání mailem. Pak musím dát spoooustu lásky &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/"&gt;nabídkám práce&lt;/a&gt;. A musím dělat sales co to půjde. A pak si udělám excelovou tabulku a spočítám si, jak si vede můj "byznys" finančně, a jestli to má nějaký smysl dál.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pokud byste čistě náhodou měli dojem, že jste oproti mě za uplynulý týden vůbec nic nestihli, tak mám pro vás skvělou zprávu! V klidu se na ten dojem &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/neni-to-zavod/"&gt;můžete vykašlat&lt;/a&gt;. Není zač!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poslední týden před slavnostním vydáním &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/candidate-handbook/"&gt;příručky&lt;/a&gt;! Takže hlavně nervy, ale i spousta práce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1296808683419193345"&gt;tweet, kde jsem dával mention médiím&lt;/a&gt;, se mi ozvali z CzechCrunch, ale jinak zatím bez odezvy. Nějak ale nemám sílu na toto teď tlačit víc. Jestli někde nějaká zmínka vyšla, tak o ní nevím (a nevidím ani v Google Analytics, že by lidi odněkud nově chodili).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vyřešil jsem problém s &lt;a href="https://docs.pyvec.org/CONTRIBUTING.html#skript-na-generovani-zapisu-hlasovani-o-grantech"&gt;automatickou dokumentací grantů na docs.pyvec.org&lt;/a&gt; repozitáři. Použil jsem GitHub Actions doplněk &lt;a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/create-pull-request"&gt;create-pull-request&lt;/a&gt; a funguje to, zdá se, skvěle!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sečetl jsem hlasy a dokončil jsem zápisem &lt;a href="https://github.com/pyvec/docs.pyvec.org/pull/159"&gt;přijetí nového člena do Pyvce&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zkusil jsem &lt;a href="https://github.com/pyvec/docs.pyvec.org/pull/162"&gt;zdokumentovat české Python Twitter účty&lt;/a&gt; a kdo k nim má přístup. Zkoušel jsem zjistit, jestli by to nešlo generovat, ať se to nemusí udržovat ručně, ale bohužel TweetDeck teams nemají žádné API. Teda mají, vidím ho v prohlížeči v konzoli, ale to není běžně přístupné. Zkusil jsem to za vás, endpoint funguje, ale když mám jen běžný vývojářský účet vrátí mi to prostředníček, že lezu, kam nemám. Dalo mi to překvapivě dost práce vyzkoušet, protože všichni na internetu používají &lt;a href="https://docs.tweepy.org/"&gt;tweepy&lt;/a&gt;, ale to zde nepřiadalo v úvahu, potřeboval jsem udělat dotaz na neoficiální endpoint. Probít se ručně přes spletitý auth Twitteru, abych mohl udělat byť jediný GET, byl ale strašný mor. Pomohl mi &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@fbilesanmi/how-to-login-with-twitter-api-using-python-6c9a0f7165c5"&gt;tento článek&lt;/a&gt; (API dokumentace samozřejmě ne).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V sobotu jsem v restauraci snědl nějaký guláš a celou neděli mi bylo hrozně špatně, otrava z jídla.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dal jsem příručku k přečtení &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bantercz/status/1297531550653972481"&gt;Lubošovi&lt;/a&gt; a tomu se líbila, nejspíš na ni napíše i nějakou recenzi na svůj &lt;a href="https://blog.zvestov.cz/"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Příručku jsem přednostně poskytl i StartupJobs, Engeto a pár jednotlivcům, jestli o ní nechtějí něco napsat na sítě nebo udělat recenzi ještě než to vyjde ofiko, ale zatím spíš ticho. Napsal jsem i Standovi ze Standa Show, jestli nechce nějak navázat &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWmXo2FD-GU"&gt;na svoje 4 roky staré video&lt;/a&gt;, ale asi už je moc velká celebrita, nestál jsem za odpověď :) Nic si z toho ale nedělám, musím to zkoušet všemi cestami a počítám s tím, že to ve většině případů nikam nepovede, ale kdyby to jednou vyšlo a někdo něco o JG fakt napsal a udělal tomu trochu publicity, bylo by to fajn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spadlo mi několikrát CI, protože se při instalaci nepodařil stáhnout systémový balíček s fonty. Nechtěl jsem se s tím moc mazat, tak jsem tam dal v Bashi akorát nekonečný cyklus, aby to zkoušelo dokola, dokud se ty fonty nainstalovat nepovede.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Naplánoval jsem nějaké poslední statusy na Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram… o tom, že za chvíli už vyjde příručka. Třeba to lidi probudí z prázdninového spánku a rozlajkujou se.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Díky &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sibiranka/status/1298877221919219714?s=12"&gt;Mariině tweetu&lt;/a&gt; jsem si opravil datum, kdy začnu zase posílat zdravotní a sociální.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Když jsem si hrál s Twitterem, po dlouhé době jsem se podíval do TweetDecku, kde jsem našel zmínky o JG, které mi úplně unikly - třeba &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/machal/status/1268072427965341697?s=21"&gt;tuto&lt;/a&gt; nebo &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kondrej/status/1282189916500381702?s=21"&gt;tuto&lt;/a&gt;. Tak jsem je pak v týdnu ještě radostně retweetoval :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1296145578641043458"&gt;Ptal jsem se na Twitteru&lt;/a&gt; jestli existuje služba, která by mi dokázala vyrobit merchendise a dělit se se mnou o příjem. Zajímalo mě to jak z hlediska JG, tak Pyvce a Python komunity, přemýšleli jsme o výrobě půllitrů. Nakonec jsem dostal několik tipů, z nichž nejvíc životaschopně vypadá t-shock.cz, kde má obchod i můj oblíbený &lt;a href="https://brancovsky.t-shock.eu/cs/"&gt;Rudolf&lt;/a&gt;. Vytvořil jsem na zkoušku &lt;a href="https://juniorguru.t-shock.eu/cs/"&gt;tenhle e-shop&lt;/a&gt;, ale ještě se rozmyslím, co s ním udělám. Když si někdo koupí hrnek nebo tričko, dostanu 10 %, což je dost málo na to, aby to někdo měl dělat proto, že mě chce podpořit. Jakože z jedné věci je to potom 20 až 40 korun. Nechci pohrdat penězi, navíc by mě to nic nestálo, ale je to prostě spíš &lt;em&gt;for fun&lt;/em&gt;, než abych to dal na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/donate/"&gt;donate stránku&lt;/a&gt; jako další možnost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uprostřed příručky je pár výzev k tomu, aby mi lidi &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/donate/"&gt;přispěli&lt;/a&gt;. Ladil jsem docela dlouho text těch výzev.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Víc lidí mi řeklo, že příručce chybí závěr. Dopsal jsem ho, je celkem dlouhý. Chtěl jsem, aby to bylo takové uzavírající a dovolil jsem si tam možná trochu jiný tón než ve zbytku příručky, o špetku vzletnější a víc patosu než v čistě praktických odstavcích. Pár lidí to přečetlo a ujistili mě, že z toho není ezo o "vášni", jak jsem to nazval já, ale možná to ještě časem přepíšu a doladím, uvidím. Zatím to tak nechám.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zjistil jsem, že na iPhone 5 s iOS 12.4.8 nefunguje v Safari posouvání sponzorských log, prostě zůstanou nahoře a odscrollujou se pryč. Vůbec nevím, jak bych to měl řešit, jak bych měl sehnat tuhle verzi Safari a odladit to na tom, takže na to asi kašlu. Na iPhone SE (starém malém) to jede.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loga jsem zmenšil ještě o 10px na výšku, protože zabíraly na malých telefonech nebo i displejích noťasů dost místa ke čtení. I tak jsou teď dost prominentní a nepřehlédnutelná, tak snad OK. Napadlo mě dát jim výšku přes jednotku vh, kterou jsem objevil minulý týden, aby byly velké relativně k výšce viewportu, to by bylo chytré, ale to by rozbilo úplně všechno ostatní v mém CSS, takže jsem od toho rychle upustil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brácha mě upozornil, že pokud je příručka živá stránka a bude se měnit, bylo by fajn mít nejaký changelog. Samozřejmě mě napadlo RSS nebo stránku s výpisem změn apod., ale toto programátorské já jsem včas zapudil. Bráchu ale napadlo, že to můžu posílat do newsletteru, tak jsem tam dal větu, že pokud chtějí lidi vědět o novinkách v příručce, ať se přihlásí do newsletteru. Mnohem lepší než RSS!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na JG byly na různých místech čísla jako "podívej se na X inzerátů od Y firem", což teď vypadalo dost blbě, protože inzerátů přímo vložených na JG je málo (teď 3) a zbytek tam jsou stažené odjinud, ale ty se mi zatím do toho čísla nepropisují. Takže i když je stránka plná inzerátů, bylo tam třeba "podívej se na 3 inzerátů od 2 firem", fuj. Zatím jsem to zakomentoval, než budu mít čas na tom programovat, ať to aspoň nevypadá trapně.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odpovídal jsem na Twitteru na &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sahbi_mohamed/status/1297957355599155201?s=12"&gt;What would you ask a junior developer?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poslal jsem faktury na dvě firmy, které si už dříve objednaly logo na příručce. Juchů! Přišlo mi blbé jim je posílat dřív, ale teď pár dní před vydáním už mi to přislo OK :D Bylo opravdu srandovní jít do &lt;a href="https://www.fakturoid.cz/"&gt;Fakturoidu&lt;/a&gt;, okopírovat si z patičky jejich IČO, nechat podle něj Fakturoid vyplnit své vlastní fakturační údaje, a poslat Fakturoidu Fakturoidem fakturu :D&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odstranil jsem v úterý upoutávku na to, že lidé z newsletteru se k příručce dostanou dřív, a večer jsem tajný náhled na příručku rozeslal všem, kdo v tu chvíli newsletter odebírali. To byly nervy!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Připravil jsem si už větev v Gitu, která se mi bude hodit na uveřejnění příručky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V Google Analytics mi přišla notifikace, že některé eventy už tam dlouho nebyly. Což je zvláštní, byly to eventy že lidi klikají na pracovní nabídky a měřím přes ně výkonnost inzerátů, kterou posílám klientům :D To by asi fungovat mělo. Naštěstí jsem měl po ruce už novou "knihovničku" na metriky z minulého týdne, takže jsem do ní prostě přepsal zbytek věcí a teď to vypadá, že to snad funguje všechno dobře. Původně jsem věšel ty eventy na odkazy nějak divoce v JS, teď se to ovládá explicitně přes &lt;code&gt;data-&lt;/code&gt; HTML atributy a je to super.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opravil jsem pokažené klikání na ToC na stránkách, kde byla hlavička menší, než je na příručce. Teď už si JS dynamicky zjišťuje, kde přesně je pozice, od které člověk vidí obsah, a podle toho počítá, která sekce je aktivní v ToC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na větších displejích jsem dal víc "vzduchu" mezi ToC a obsah. Odebral jsem podtržení odkazů, aby to nepůsobilo jako změť čar. Snad lidem i bez toho dojde, že ToC je klikací. Vypadá to o dost odlehčeněji. Díky &lt;a href="https://tystar.cz/"&gt;Štěpánce&lt;/a&gt; za tipy!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asi čtyři lidi mi nezávisle na sobě napsali, jestli by ta ToC nemohla ukazovat podsekce jen v aktivní sekci a zbytek že by byl sbalený. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/benAbraham/"&gt;Dan&lt;/a&gt; to dotáhl tak daleko, že si dokonce všiml, že stačí přidat dva řádky do CSS a bylo by to hotové :D Tak jsem je přidal a je to hotové a je to myslím o dost lepší! A myslím, že to pomohlo i s problémem, že pokud byl člověk v nějakých hodně spodních sekcích a neměl odscrollovaný obsah, neviděl ani kde vlastně zrovna je. Teď už obsah na příručce není tak dlouhý a pracuje se s ním líp. Velký dík za testování použitelnosti ToC patří &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/magdalenakrufova/"&gt;Magdaleně&lt;/a&gt; z &lt;a href="https://opengeolabs.cz/"&gt;OpenGeoLabs&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A téže Magdaleně patří dík i za super milé &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CEbhbpkHE0j/"&gt;zhodnocení příručky&lt;/a&gt;, které jsem nakonec &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/candidate-handbook/"&gt;dal jako citát i na web&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sekce zkrácené tlačítkem "Zobrazit víc" (&lt;a href="https://junior.guru/learn/#what"&gt;třeba tady&lt;/a&gt;) jsem udělal tak, aby při najetí myší nad sekci tlačítko hned zmodralo a bylo jasné, že je rozklikávací, a aby se roztáhla po kliknutí kamkoliv na tu sekci, ne jen na tlačítko. Přijde mi to teď o dost víc intuitivní.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prošel jsem si &lt;a href="https://www.jakpsatweb.cz/seo/seo.html"&gt;SEO na JPW&lt;/a&gt; a trochu upravil &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; stránek. Dostal jsem se k &lt;a href="http://vyhledavace.info/"&gt;vyhledavace.info&lt;/a&gt;, ale nějak jsem neměl sílu to číst. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1299276394518765570"&gt;Ptal jsem se na Twitteru&lt;/a&gt;, jestli někdo nemá nějaké materiály, ale bez odpovědi. Zjistil jsem, že Seznam má velký problém vracet JG na dotazy ohledně programování a i DuckDuckGo přepnuté na ČR jej šoupne strašně dolů. Přemýšlím, čím to je - možná mají problém s doménou .guru a tím, že URL mám v angličtině, třeba &lt;code&gt;/learn/&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/candidate-handbook/&lt;/code&gt;, atd.? :(&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Objevil jsem &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1299289912068497409"&gt;chybu na Seznam.cz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odstranil jsem PayPal z možností poslat mi peníze na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/donate/"&gt;donate stránce&lt;/a&gt;. Využil to za celou dobu jediný člověk, poslal mi tam stovku, ze které teda po poplatku PayPalu zbylo asi 80 korun. Z té stovky mám samozřejmě radost, ale na jednorázové platby tam mám QR kód k bankovnímu převodu, který je v takovém případě lepší. A největší smysl pro mě stejně mají GitHub Sponsors a Patreon, protože jsou pravidelné, a měl bych je razit přednostně.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Díval jsem se na GitHub Sponsors API a na Patreon API, jak těžké by bylo vytáhnout automatizovaně nějaké info o lidech, kteří mi přispívají - třeba avatar, ať můžu na webu zobrazit obličeje vedle sebe a napsat k tomu "tihle všichni úžasní lidi mi přispívají, přispěj taky!" nebo tak něco. GitHub Sponsors jsou v jejich API v4, což je GraphQL API, no budiž. Patreon má API a dokonce Python knihovnu, ale jako obvykle je tam smrtící auth. Než pochopím kam dát jaký token a co se má dít, když chci jen napsat blbý Python skript a netvořím žádné přihlašování přes OAuth2, tak než na tohle přijdu, tak to budu mít dřív 4 děti a dům a psa a děti půjdou do školy a budu dědeček a umřu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1298637250536841228"&gt;Posteskl jsem si na Twitteru&lt;/a&gt; o všech těch API, jejichž auth je peklo, a lidem se to líbilo. Zvláště tady &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jacksonj04/status/1298681722519912448"&gt;Nick&lt;/a&gt; pokračoval ve skvělém duchu :D&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Koukám, že jsem toho moc nepřečetl. Asi je to tím, že jsem tento týden hodně lítal po sociálních sítích a i v reálu jsem lítal po různých kamarádech a místo čtení si s nimi povídal a coworkoval s nimi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category></entry><entry><title>Týdenní poznámky: Loga firem na příručce</title><link href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/tydenni-poznamky-loga-firem-na-prirucce/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-08-21T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2020-08-21T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Honza Javorek</name></author><id>tag:honzajavorek.cz,2020-08-21:/blog/tydenni-poznamky-loga-firem-na-prirucce/</id><summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utekl další týden (17.8. — 21.8.) a tak &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/tydenni-poznamky-konecne-spokojen-s-toc/"&gt;stejně jako minule&lt;/a&gt; sepisuji, co jsem dělal a co zajímavého jsem se naučil.

&lt;p&gt;Jak jsem psal minule, tento týden jsem pracoval jen pár dní, protože se mi sešlo jednak volno, jednak nějaké rodinné události. V neděli jsem uběhl &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/252296662521351/"&gt;10 km v Kozojedech&lt;/a&gt;, byl to prima závod a už se těším na příští ročník. Naposledy jsem činnost typu běh vykonával podle mých záznamů před rokem, a to jsem se šel ještě jen proběhnout za barák, takže už jen dokončení závodu považuji za velký úspěch. 10.82 km, čas 1:10, tempo 6:32, nastoupáno 175 m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="loga-firem"&gt;Loga firem&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#loga-firem" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Čtvrtek i pátek jsem více méně finišoval vzhled příručky a to hlavně proužku, který by měl zobrazovat loga firem. Prvotní nápad naštěstí celkem fungoval, ne jak u ToC (viz minulé poznámky), jen jsem si hrál s tím, jestli se mají loga nějak zvětšovat nebo přeskládávat, když člověk scrolluje. Nakonec jsem od všech animací a přesunů upustil, protože to v nějakém prohlížeči vždy nevypadalo dobře, chovalo se to divně, nebo to prostě celé působilo přeplácaně.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loga jsou &lt;code&gt;position: sticky&lt;/code&gt; a s malou pomocí JavaScriptu při pozicování a detekci v jaké fázi scrollování člověk je, jsou celé v CSS. Kvůli proužku s logy se musel taky zvětšit "offset" pro odkazy "na kotvu", tzn. nárazník, který zaručuje, že když někdo jde v prohlížeči na &lt;code&gt;#odstavec&lt;/code&gt;, tak nadpis a kus toho odstavce nebude skrytá pod všemi těmi proužky nahoře, ale bude odsazená od vrchu stránky. Bylo naštěstí jednodušší to vyřešit, než jsem čekal, stačilo pár dalších řádků JS a CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nakonec jsem přidal reálná loga firem, které si je předplatily a zkoumal, jak to vypadá. Myslím, že to ujde.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="Loga" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/loga.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na obrázku vidíte loga v jednom proužku. Když se scrolluje, tento proužek se nalepí pod další vrchní proužky, dostane stín, a s nimi pak cestuje.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ještě jsem přidal nějaké to měření přes Google Analytics, jestli a kolik lidí na loga kliká, ať to pak můžu firmám posílat, a přidal automaticky UTM parametry k odkazům. K tomu jsem si napsal novou "knihovničku", která tohle bude umět dělat i jinde a lze ji instruovat skrze &lt;code&gt;data-&lt;/code&gt; atributy v HTML, ale zatím jsem se neobtěžoval s tím předělávat na ni staré věci. Nějaké posílání statistik taky zatím nemám, na to bude čas po vydání příručky, ale hlavně aby se to od začátku měřilo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na JG se objevil &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/d0175235aeab461c2adb9a0796f40cf8c54ca085fb657ce5b14c367b/"&gt;nový inzerát&lt;/a&gt;, tak snad se to opravdu s podzimem zase rozjede.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upgradoval jsem závislosti na některých projektech Python komunity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Snažil jsem se na &lt;a href="https://github.com/pyvec/docs.pyvec.org"&gt;docs.pyvec.org&lt;/a&gt; vyřešit commitování do chráněné hlavní větve tak, že bych pomocí GitHub Actions automaticky vytvořil spíš Pull Request, ale zatím neúspěšně. Věnoval jsem tomu hodinku v pátek a zase se k tomu vrátím jindy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na příručku jsem přidal datum, kdy byla naposledy aktualizovaná, aby lidi viděli, že text časem opravdu upravuju. Informace se vytahuje přímo z Gitu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opravil jsem jeden (až dva) podivné bugy v zobrazování věcí v Safari.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Napsal jsem Czechitas e-mail, jestli mají zájem nakouknout do příručky před jejím vydáním výměnou za to, že o ní něco napíšou na svůj blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Po minulých neúspěších s různými pokusy o tiskovou zprávu jsem zatím zkusil něco, co mě stojí nejméně energie: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1296808683419193345"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;, kde se ptám, jestli někdo nechce přístup k příručce dřív, výměnou za publicitu. Sice jsem dal omylem mention na slovenské Nko, ale to se snese :) Tato výzva platí i pro jednotlivce, takže pokud máte blog nebo někde nějakých pár followers, napište mi a domluvíme se.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Začínám si psát rozvrh činností, které musím postupně udělat v souvislosti s uvěřejněním příručky. Bude to maso.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poslal jsem první větší fakturu!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="Peníze" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/faktura.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
Hluboký lidský příběh&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V grafu nejsou &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/donate/"&gt;příspěvky přes GitHub Sponsors nebo Patreon&lt;/a&gt;, s nimi by to vypadalo méně tragicky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="co-me-zaujalo"&gt;Co mě zaujalo&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#co-me-zaujalo" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id="aktualni-strategie"&gt;Aktuální strategie&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#aktualni-strategie" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Srpen mám nabitý různými prodlouženými víkendy a dovolenými, ale tento týden jsem mohl celkem nerušeně věnovat práci. I proto se trochu rozepíšu o dlouhodobější strategii, kterou teď mám.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="leto"&gt;Léto&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#leto" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Po koronaviru má hodně větších firem z opatrnosti stále &lt;em&gt;hiring freeze&lt;/em&gt; a i pokud nemají, mají různá jiná omezení, která ústí v to, že nemají chuť najímat juniory. Proto dost spadl počet nabídek práce na JG poté, když staré inzeráty expirovaly a v důsledku působí &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/"&gt;stránka s nabídkami&lt;/a&gt; dost neutěšeně. Během druhé půlky července a dále srpna jsem navíc viděl velký pokles zájmu tak nějak o všechno. Léto se naplno projevilo a kdo na jeho začátku váhal, jestli někam vyjet, tak váhat přestal a vyjel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V souvislosti s tím jsem si řekl, že posunu vydání &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/candidate-handbook/"&gt;příručky&lt;/a&gt; na 1.9. a nebudu do té doby dělat žádný velký marketing ani sales. Místo toho se soustředím na programování: Připravuji příručku na její vydání a pak bych chtěl zapracovat na té stránce s inzeráty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="co-chci-dokoncit"&gt;Co chci dokončit&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#co-chci-dokoncit" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Příprava příručky musí skončit zhruba týden před koncem srpna, abych ji mohl rozeslat lidem z &lt;a href="http://eepurl.com/gyG8Bb"&gt;newsletteru&lt;/a&gt; dřív, než oficiálně vyjde. Tento týden jsem do toho trochu šlápl, takže je to na dobré cestě, ač tedy příští týden mám trochu volna a trochu rodinných událostí a nevím, nakolik budu zvládat dodělat poslední kousky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na stránce s nabídkami práce musím hlavně spojit nabídky z JG a &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/"&gt;nabídky z robota&lt;/a&gt;, a ty z JG nějak zvýraznit. Potom chci dodělat filtr na město a mít pro každé město stránku zvlášť, např. juniorní nabídky v Praze, juniorní nabídky v Brně, atd. To by, myslím si, mohlo pomoct jak uživatelům v orientaci v inzerátech, tak SEO. Vrátit bych se měl i k samotnému robotovi a opravit v něm chybky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="co-dal"&gt;Co dál?&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#co-dal" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jak budou tyto dvě věci hotové, tzn. asi někdy v září, nejspíš přestanu úplně programovat. JG bude v podobě, v jaké už prostě musí začít fungovat a něco vydělávat. Začnu se prakticky plně soustředit na marketing a sales, udělám si základní propočty příjmy/výdaje, a uvidím, kam až se dostanu s návštěvností a jestli začnou firmy inzerovat nebo mi více lidí &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/donate/"&gt;přispěje&lt;/a&gt;, tzn. zaplatí za příručku z pozice čtenáře. Těžko se srovnávat třeba s Ondřejem (&lt;a href="https://github.com/sponsors/ondrejmirtes/"&gt;GitHub Sponsors&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/phpstan"&gt;Patreon&lt;/a&gt;), který má &lt;a href="https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan"&gt;celosvětově užitečný projekt&lt;/a&gt;, ale zase proč to nezkusit. Nevím, kde má můj počet přispěvatelů strop a třeba to nakonec může fungovat lépe, než platby za nabídky práce :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="table-of-contents"&gt;Table of Contents&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#table-of-contents" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tento týden byl ve znamení tvorby &lt;em&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/em&gt; pro příručku. Sice by se zdálo, že z minulého týdne už to bylo skoro vyřešené, ale když jsem pak zkusil do onoho řešení obléct ToC příručky, která je fakt dlouhá, prasklo to ve švech a bylo jasné, že ve skutečnosti řešení nemám. Bylo to celkem frustrující. Taková blbost a já se s tím mažu už pár týdnů (ano, prošpikovaných dovolenýma, ale stejně).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="jak-to-zacalo"&gt;Jak to začalo&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#jak-to-zacalo" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Původní problém, který jsem se snažil vyřešit, byl orientace čtenáře v příručce, protože si na to víc lidí stěžovalo. Dalo se to vyřešit různě:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přepsat příručku z HTML třeba do Markdownu a použít hotové řešení, udělat něco jako &lt;a href="https://docs.pyvec.org/"&gt;docs.pyvec.org&lt;/a&gt; nebo &lt;a href="https://cojeapi.cz/"&gt;cojeapi.cz&lt;/a&gt; a třeba to jen vhodně integrovat a zasadit do JG designu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rozsekat příručku na více stránek, přidat nějaké menu a nechat navigaci na starých dobrých technologiích, jako jsou HTML a HTTP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nechat příručku na jedné stránce (dlouhé nudli), přidat nějaké menu a okořenit to trochou JavaScriptu, aby se podle scrollování ukazovalo, kde člověk zrovna je.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vybral jsem si poslední možnost, přišla mi nejjednodušší. Původně jsem myslel, že rozšířím stránku a ToC tam prostě napíšu a jen napozicuju vedle textu. Jenže jsem se vydal na nějakou slepou uličku co se týče designu a technického zpracování a dospěl jsem k nějakému otevírátku a kdo ví čemu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verze z minulého týdne skončila na tom, že když byla ToC delší než výška obrazovky, neexistovalo na to žádné řešení. Tak jsem to zkusil upravit tak, aby se ToC otevírala jako výsuvný panel z boku celé stránky, což by celkem mohlo fungovat jak na počítači, tak na mobilu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="obluda"&gt;Obluda&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#obluda" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když to bylo hotové, vypadalo to strašně, neukazovalo to hned člověku kde je - musel něco rozkliknout, rozklikávátko nešlo dobře na stránce vidět, na mobilu to nenavigovalo dobře, neobarvovalo se jako aktivní co se obarvovat mělo a celé to při manipulaci problikávalo. K tomu všemu byla každá další věc neočekávanou komplikací - třeba přidání podnadpisů. S vysouvací ToC taky začalo dělat dost problém schovávání hlavičky, když se scrollovalo dolů, takže jsem ho zrušil. Jenže byla pak velká, takže jsem vynalezl důmyslný systém animovaného zmenšování hlavičky při pohybu na stránce. Prostě, z jednoduché ToC vylezla komplexní, nefunkční, animovaná obluda. Měl jsem tam i &lt;a href="https://reactgo.com/css-pulse-animation/"&gt;pulsující&lt;/a&gt; šipku, která upozorňovala na tlačítko pro rozkliknutí obsahu, LOL! (Ale teď aspoň umím v CSS pulsovat, heč!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Po úterku, kdy jsem to dodělal a koukal na výsledek, se mi chtělo JG smazat a vrátit se do Oraclu, ale udržel jsem emoce, zavřel počítač a nechal si to projít hlavou do druhého dne :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="Obluda" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/obluda.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
Obluda&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="krasa-v-jednoduchosti"&gt;Krása v jednoduchosti&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#krasa-v-jednoduchosti" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ve středu jsem vymyslel statičtější a jednodušší přístup k ToC. Dokonce jsem zvažoval stránku rozsekat na několik podstránek. Obludu jsem smazal a vrátil se k původní myšlence: Obsah odsadit a ToC zobrazit vedle něj. Oproti předchozím pokusům se mi povedlo celkem rychle vymyslet, jak to udělat, a ToC jsem napozicoval doleva, což mi vizuálně hned sedlo, oproti všem předchozím pokusům ji mít vpravo. Celé to začalo nějak fungovat a dobře vypadat a já se zaradoval, že to konečně mám. Později jsem už jen dodělal detaily jako mizení ToC když člověk odscrolluje úplně dolů nebo zobrazování aktuálního nadpisu. Minimum JS, vše důležité se řeší v CSS. Příště si musím hned uvědomit, že když mám více jak 20 řádků JS, tak to je slepá ulička a ne způsob, jakým chci JG tvořit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zkoušel jsem si sice hrát chvíli s &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/pushState"&gt;History.pushState()&lt;/a&gt; (aby se při scrollování měnila adresa v prohlížeči), ale hned jsem viděl, že to šťourá do přirozeného chování browseru a musel bych ošetřovat všelijaké speciální případy, takže jsem se na to vykašlal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zmenšování nebo schovávání hlavičky jsem nakonec úplně vyhodil. Myšlenka to byla hezká, ale stejně jako u samotné ToC, projevil se efekt toho, že to šťourá do přirozeného chování věcí na webové stránce. I když takové věci na první pohled mohou vypadat funkčně, člověk pak dny a týdny chodí a zjišťuje, v jakém dalším případě to způsobuje nějaký problém, a jen opravuje a opravuje.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verze pro mobil se nakonec nějak vyloupla sama. Lištu pod hlavičkou, která ukazuje aktuální nadpis, jsem zachoval jen pro mobil, a když už tam bylo to tlačítko na otevírání obsahu, jen jsem jej předělal na odkaz a ten čtenáře pošle na ToC tak jak je na stránce. ToC na mobilu není nijak pozicovaná, je prostě na začátku dokumentu v rámci jeho flow. A přijde mi, že to funguje překvapivě dobře. A tak jednoduché to bylo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hotovo. Vyřešil jsem akorát ještě bug, že se špatně detekoval aktuální nadpis v případě "schovaných" sekcí s podnadpisy (např. &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/learn/#covid19"&gt;Co způsobí koronavirus?&lt;/a&gt;). Nepřišel jsem úplně na příčinu, ale když jsem schované podnadpisy vyhodil z detekce aktuální pozice, tak to přestalo zlobit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="jg-roste-do-sirky"&gt;JG roste do šířky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#jg-roste-do-sirky" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No a nakonec jsem JG odladil pro větší displeje, než mám já. Pracuji na 12" s 2304x1440 retina (takže 1280x800), ale hodně lidí má větší displej a na nich asi vypadalo JG dost jako nudle uprostřed obrazovky. Do teď jsem to nějak neměl chuť řešit, ale s ToC na boku se už hodilo přidat do stran místo. V Google Analytics jsem zjistil, že nejčastější rozlišení návštěvníků jsou 1920x1080 a 1536x864. Toto jsem si přidal do &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Responsive_Design_Mode"&gt;Responsive Design Mode ve Firefoxu&lt;/a&gt;, připojil externí širokoúhlý monitor co máme na filmy, a tam poladil ideální maximální šířku stránky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Trvalý odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teď už jen vymyslet zobrazování log sponzorů a příručka bude připravená. A i ta loga už mám trochu rozdělaná a myslím, že je to na dobré cestě. Co jsem ještě stihl kromě ToC?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Udělal jsem něco málo na &lt;a href="https://docs.pyvec.org/"&gt;docs.pyvec.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jedna mentoring session&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Napsal jsem &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/junior.guru/blob/09eab071caeaefe3acb62dace6d3ffe7207af9af/scripts/generate_toc.py"&gt;skript&lt;/a&gt;, který vezme HTML šablonu, zparsuje ji jako HTML, najde v ní nadpisy a vygeneruje HTML s ToC. Tu následně prostě copy-paste dám do oné šablony. Asi by se to mohlo generovat nějak dynamicky, ale přišlo mi, že tohle je dostatečné &lt;em&gt;quick &amp;amp; dirty&lt;/em&gt; řešení pro to, jak mám ty šablony a obsah teď udělané (vše je v HTML). Aby se mi to nerozsynchronizovalo, napsal jsem i &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/junior.guru/blob/09eab071caeaefe3acb62dace6d3ffe7207af9af/tests/test_toc.py"&gt;kontrolní test&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pulsovací animaci jsem nakonec využil! Když se přesunu na nějaký nadpis, tak se skrze pulsující animaci mírně zvýrazní. Funguje to jen někde (třeba v Safari ne, tzn. ani na iOS).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zjistil jsem, že existuje &lt;a href="https://css-tricks.com/fun-viewport-units/"&gt;vh&lt;/a&gt; :D Užitečné, spoustu věcí to usnadňuje! Škoda, že jsem o tom nevěděl od začátku, co dělám JG.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dolaďoval jsem "předmluvu" příručky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1279212166571159552"&gt;tip od Simona Willisona&lt;/a&gt; jsem zkusil editor &lt;a href="https://www.figma.com/"&gt;Figma&lt;/a&gt;, abych upravil SVG pro ikonu ToC tlačítka. Spokojenost! Pro nějakou občasnou editaci vektorových věcí to vypadá o dost líp než Inkscape na macOS nebo cokoliv podobného.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dostal jsem nabídku, že by kamarád na svých webech &lt;em&gt;pro bono&lt;/em&gt; zobrazil reklamní banner JG. Slíbil jsem, že ho připravím, ale tento týden jsem to nestihl. JG bude mít první opravdovou reklamu! :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pokud byste čistě náhodou měli dojem, že jste oproti mě za uplynulý týden vůbec nic nestihli, tak mám pro vás skvělou zprávu! V klidu se na ten dojem &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/neni-to-zavod/"&gt;můžete vykašlat&lt;/a&gt;. Není zač!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pracoval jsem prakticky jen pondělí až středa a co si budeme povídat, moc jsem toho nestihl. Od čtvrtka až do neděle jsem byl v Brně, kde jsem nebyl už strašně dlouho. Navštívil jsem rodinu i kamarády, ale ani tak jsem nestihl navštívit všechny. Povedlo se mi ale aspoň navštívit hned dva klenoty Jižní Moravy, a to &lt;a href="https://www.idnes.cz/brno/zpravy/pruvodce-to-je-brno-stanislav-biler.A170405_2317327_brno-zpravy_krut/foto/KRU6a610a_Vstiek.JPG"&gt;Adamov a Blansko&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Po Python "sprintu" předchozí týden jsem se ještě utrhnul k nějakým dodělávkám, a to hlavně k dokončování &lt;a href="https://github.com/pyvec/docs.pyvec.org/pull/146"&gt;archivace hlasování o finančních grantech do naší dokumentace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taky hned přišlo několik PR na &lt;a href="https://github.com/pyvec/jechova/"&gt;Jechovou&lt;/a&gt;. To mě zaujalo, protože Jechová funguje a nic na ní nebylo potřeba měnit, nebylo nic rozbité, ale lidi měli i přesto chuť poslat PR. Vysvětluji si to tím, že její kód je tak jednoduchý, že je bariréra pro přispění hodně malá a lidi motivuje poslat vylepšení i jen tak. Je to možná poučení i pro jiné projekty, které v komunitě spravujeme. Čím jednodušší, tím životaschopnější.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2x mentoring session&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Propagoval jsem na internetu &lt;a href="https://africa.pycon.org/"&gt;PyCon Africa&lt;/a&gt;, který zrovna probíhal online.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Koukal jsem na &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/goodmarketinghq/status/1281592433931948033?s=12"&gt;tohle video&lt;/a&gt; o tom, jak dělat správně pre-launch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vytvořil jsem &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/candidate-handbook/"&gt;stránku pro příručku&lt;/a&gt;, normálně přístupnou a zasazenou do menu. Na ni jsem vytvořil "teaser" na příručku, který můžu dále propagovat. Do úvodního textu jsem se pokusil aplikovat nějaká moudra z videa výše, ale jestli se mi to aspoň trochu povedlo, to netuším.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Po přidání položky do podmenu jsem si vzpomněl, proč bylo původně vlevo, i když vpravo by možná vypadalo líp. Protože na mobilu se to horizontálně scrolluje a to nefunguje moc dobře, když je to zarovnáno doprava. Takže je podmenu zase vlevo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strávil jsem nějaký čas dolaďováním toho, aby bylo vidět, že se to podmenu dá horizontálně scrollovat. Třeba na mobilu se to otevřelo tak, že nebylo vůbec zřejmé, že jsou za prvními odkazy ještě nějaké další. JavaScriptem tedy detekuji, jak moc co jde vidět, a podle toho to menu na mobilu jakože trochu nedbale odscrolluji, aby bylo jasné, že se scrollovat dá. Nic lepšího mě nenapadlo, designově se takhle podmenu teď dělají, s přístupností se asi nikdo moc nemaže. Já bych se s tím možná taky neměl tak moc mazat, ale jako když mi taková věc pro většinu lidí na mobilu vytlačí odkaz na stránku &lt;em&gt;Pro firmy&lt;/em&gt; mimo viewport, tak to nemůžu nechat být.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimálně půl hodiny jsem se snažil doma zabít nebo vyhnat jednu extrémně otravnou mouchu. Vysmívala se mi a sedala si na mě.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pomáhal jsem PyLadies s rozhodováním ohledně podzimních kurzů a s nástřelem výpočtu nějakých financí.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ladil jsem CSS žlutě zvýrazněných bloků, které na JG upozorňují na různé další věci. Dělal jsem kód obecnější a méně psychedelický, abych tyto bloky mohl použít s různým obsahem a v různých kontextech.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tak dlouho jsem přemýšlel jak nacenit "review inzerátu práce", až jsem nabídku od kamaráda asi tak nějak prošvih :( Každopádně - pokud mi někdo pošle pracovní inzerát k okomentování, jak to mám nacenit? Jasně, můžu si dát nějakou pevnou cenu za kus odvozenou třeba od hodiny času, kterou nad tím plus minus strávím. Bojuju ale s tím, že když pošlu zpět 10 připomínek, jde ta práce vidět, ale když ten inzerát bude dobrý, nemůžu přece poslat palec nahoru a k němu fakturu na hodinu práce. Jako strávil jsem ji s tím tak či tak, přečíst jsem to musel, zamyslet jsem se musel, ale klient z toho má jen informaci, že je to dobrý a tak nějak to na mě nepůsobí dobře. Jak to dělají právníci apod.? :D Jak byste takovou věc nacenili?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;V Brně zavedli &lt;a href="https://pipniajed.cz/"&gt;pípni a jeď&lt;/a&gt;. Pro občasné návštěvníky, jako jsem já, je to super. Zajímavé je, že tento způsob placení za jízdné, který jsem zažil poprvé myslím v Londýně, se v ČR šíří z východu na západ. &lt;a href="https://www.lupa.cz/clanky/daniel-morys-dopravniho-podniku-ostrava-stavime-mhd-rizenou-pomoci-dat/"&gt;Nejdříve to měli v Ostravě&lt;/a&gt;, teď v Brně. Třeba se jednou dočkáme i v Praze!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pokud jste kdysi hráli &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Settlers"&gt;The Settlers&lt;/a&gt;, ale dnes máte macOS a tedy vám žádná z těch her nepojede, existuje určitá spása v podobě Open Source hry &lt;a href="https://www.widelands.org/"&gt;Widelands&lt;/a&gt; (stačí udělat &lt;code&gt;brew cask install widelands&lt;/code&gt;). Bohužel je to klon Settlers II. a ne III., takže grafika nic moc, ale herní princip je stejný. Dal jsem tomu zatím tak 2 hodiny, tzn. tutoriál a pár minut kampaně, ale přijde mi, že hrát se to dá.&lt;/li&gt;

V Bruselu jsme dnes prohráli. Naštěstí. Naše zájmy hájili jiní&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Když prohrát znamená zvítězit… Sním o tom, že jednou budou Češi normálním, profesionálním hráčem v EU, který vyjednává, má spojence, zvládá konstruktivní politiku. Jenže my ze sebe stále děláme lojzíky se slámou v botech.&lt;/li&gt;
