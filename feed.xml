Many fear that AI will replace human software engineers or make it harder for junior programmers to break into the field.
But what if the truth is quite the opposite? As someone in the business of helping people switch careers and learn coding through my website &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/"&gt;junior.guru&lt;/a&gt;, I believe that in the age of AI, junior developers may actually hold the winning edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Empowered by AI: Why junior devs have the winning edge" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/woman-programming-on-her-laptop.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figure-caption"&gt;
I found her on &lt;a href="https://lexica.art/prompt/9be96fa9-4d86-40c7-bcb9-2ef287062032"&gt;Lexica.art&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hype aside, here are some facts: AI has the potential to make previously unscalable tasks scalable and seemingly impossible tasks achievable. Unlike recent hypes &lt;a href="https://blog.mollywhite.net/is-web3-bullshit/"&gt;like blockchain&lt;/a&gt;, people can immediately recognize the value that AI tools provide. Moreover, the cost of using these tools is often free or reasonably cheap. Almost anyone can come up with tasks where AI can be beneficial, including your hairdresser. This has the potential to be a game-changer, akin to the impact of calculators, cars, personal computers, or smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-smartphone-augments-my-abilities"&gt;How smartphone augments my abilities&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#how-smartphone-augments-my-abilities" title="Link to this heading"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's take a closer look at how the latest of these inventions has changed our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I get lost in the streets and look at my iPhone, I can immediately see exactly where I am. I can look up the closest ATMs and walk to one of them. I can use contactless Apple Pay to withdraw some cash, and that's just a fraction of what the phone can do. It augments my abilities in such a way that my grandfather, in his 30s, would think it's all just pure sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any place, at any moment, I have easy access to most of the information collected by humans, in all its breadth and depth. In contrast, my grandfather had a limited set of books, maybe a radio. But I have the internet, Google, Wikipedia, Stack Overflow, and so much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Kniha Lidé a informace" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/img-2861.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figure-caption"&gt;
Book &lt;a href="https://www.databazeknih.cz/knihy/lide-a-informace-146195"&gt;People and information&lt;/a&gt; by Vladimír Smetáček, 1981, photo by me&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm also way more ambitious with what I work on. With all the parallel conversations, tasks, and projects, I'm probably 100 times more effective and productive than my grandfather. I don't say this is only good; fetishizing productivity and trying to get more done in every second of our lives &lt;a href="https://www.oliverburkeman.com/posts"&gt;has its own problems&lt;/a&gt;, but the fact is that thanks to technology augmenting my abilities, I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do more than my ancestors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My smartphone or personal computer also compensate for my limitations. I'm so bad at math that I can't do 12 + 42 in my head without an embarrassing amount of effort. So I type even simple stuff like that into the calculator (to be precise, into the Spotlight or Google search fields). I might feel silly doing it, but at the same time, I know I can rely on it. Anytime. Thanks to that, I'm not afraid of adding. Not even multiplying! And with &lt;a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/"&gt;WolframAlpha&lt;/a&gt;, I'm downright invincible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ai-stands-for-new-cool-tool"&gt;AI stands for 'new cool tool'&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#ai-stands-for-new-cool-tool" title="Link to this heading"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, back to AI. Today, the terms AI and ChatGPT are often used interchangeably, but it's important to understand what AI actually means. Essentially, every time humans invent something that allows computers to do tasks they couldn't do before, we call it artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI has been playing against us in single-player games since the early days of computers. It's behind the face detection in our cameras for better photos, the translations in Google Translate, and the spell check in Google Docs, to name just a few examples. AI is already all around us in various forms. As we become accustomed to its presence, the AI label shifts to something newer, which is more &lt;em&gt;wow&lt;/em&gt;. This is called the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_effect"&gt;AI effect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="0 A.D. screenshot" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2023-04-15-at-22-15-20.png" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figure-caption"&gt;
AI in my favorite computer game, &lt;a href="https://play0ad.com/"&gt;0 A.D.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon Willison describes &lt;a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Apr/2/calculator-for-words/"&gt;LLMs like GPT as calculators for words&lt;/a&gt;, and I find this analogy to be useful for predicting the future as well. We will learn how to use these "calculators", adapt to them, get bored, and eventually move on to something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first iPhone was released in 2007, when I was 20 years old. While smartphones have revolutionized many aspects of my life and given me seemingly unimaginable superpowers in the eyes of my ancestors, today the device is no longer &lt;em&gt;wow&lt;/em&gt;, it's boring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my tasks and projects, I have naturally transitioned to a higher level of abstraction. To find something, my grandfather had to rely on paper maps, understand how to locate himself on the map, and comprehend the intricacies of map usage. Today, I can simply type "kebab" into Google Maps, tap on an arrow, and a voice tells me where to go. I can focus on the task at hand and forget about the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="llms-are-the-next-level-of-augmentation"&gt;LLMs are the next level of augmentation&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#llms-are-the-next-level-of-augmentation" title="Link to this heading"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people say LLMs (large language models) make mistakes and that's why they're downright &lt;em&gt;useless&lt;/em&gt;. But in this world, nothing is perfect. Humans are okay doing some extra steps if there's a tool that's just &lt;em&gt;good enough&lt;/em&gt;. If it solves &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle"&gt;80% of the problem with 20% of the effort&lt;/a&gt;, great! This is true for cars, phones, planes, computers, all software, and it applies to LLMs, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In just a few months after the ChatGPT launch, we now have &lt;a href="https://openai.com/research/gpt-4"&gt;GPT-4&lt;/a&gt;, which is much better, and &lt;a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins"&gt;plugins&lt;/a&gt;, which further revolutionize the game. Still, as of now, asking ChatGPT to return facts or other exact information isn't the best way to use it. However, it is already an amazing tool for mentoring, learning, and brainstorming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure figure-blockquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of blindly copy/pasting the code that ChatGPT generates, go through it line-by-line, and make sure you understand. Ask it for clarification. And double-check things that seem suspicious with an authoritative source (eg. the official documentation). Keep in mind that LLMs are 100% confident, but not 100% accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption class="blockquote-footer"&gt; Josh Comeau, &lt;a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/blog/the-end-of-frontend-development/"&gt;The End of Front-End Development&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;See how last December, Simon Willison &lt;a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Dec/5/rust-chatgpt-copilot/"&gt;used ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot to learn Rust&lt;/a&gt;. I've seen people telling the LLM to behave like a tutor who never answers directly but guides you to come up with the solution yourself by giving you questions and little hints. This can be further enhanced with &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91IPJ6LFmto"&gt;links to relevant docs and additional explanations&lt;/a&gt;. Despite its imperfections, it's already very, very useful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="junior-stands-for-less-experience"&gt;Junior stands for 'less experience'&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#junior-stands-for-less-experience" title="Link to this heading"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some say that ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot produce code that is already similar to what an entry-level software engineer would write. They conclude that this means junior devs won't be needed anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, being a junior is just a career phase. People try something, get better, become juniors, get better, become seniors. Tools can make the transition easier or faster, but they cannot replace juniors specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I know, AI can't clone people yet. Although I've seen many companies neglecting the truth and spending immense money and resources on hiring seniors instead of nurturing junior talent, the only way seniors can really reproduce is by teaching those who are less experienced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may seem obvious, but it apparently needs to be stated: there are no seniors without juniors. Juniors are the future seniors, and all seniors were once juniors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I've mentioned, AI already makes the transition from junior to senior faster and easier. However, it cannot eliminate the difference between individuals with varying levels of experience in the job.
If the difference ceases to exist, it would imply that the job is unnecessary altogether.
And I don't think that AI will render all devs obsolete (more on that later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="why-junior-devs-have-the-best-timing"&gt;Why junior devs have the best timing&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#why-junior-devs-have-the-best-timing" title="Link to this heading"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is a new tool augmenting our abilities and learning is suddenly faster and easier, what's the outcome?
Better juniors and seniors!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Chart" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/juniors.svg" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a bit silly chart, but you probably get how I think about it.
It's gonna be the same as with personal computers.
The accountants still exist, they just transformed into &lt;em&gt;personal computer operators&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Design" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2023-04-15-at-15-52-25.png" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you see the lines, numbers, and letters?
The architects used to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_drawing"&gt;draw all this manually&lt;/a&gt;.
Today they have AutoCADs.
The advent of software for architects did not render junior architects obsolete; rather, it elevated them to a higher level of abstraction in their work. They can now skip technicalities and focus on the task at hand. And perhaps thanks to that their teams can pursue more ambitious projects, such as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_architecture"&gt;organic architecture&lt;/a&gt;, which goes beyond straight lines and right angles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AI revolution will disrupt the job market, but not necessarily in a way that makes junior developers obsolete. Depending on the pace of change, companies will gradually or suddenly start favoring individuals who are fluent with the new AI superpowers, similar to how they once favored those who were skilled in MS Word 97. Do you recall the era when "computer skills" were highlighted on CVs, along with computer courses for adults?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who were studying accounting or architecture at that time were in a prime position. They had to do everything on paper during their studies, which may have been tedious if they had a sense that computers could automate those tasks. However, in their careers, they became the first operators of personal computers in their respective fields. As for those who were already established in their careers, they had to learn and adapt to computers, which became the new norm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more savvy among beginner devs are already utilizing AI as their mentor. They won't have to alter their habits, routines, tools, or approach. They won't need to abandon their perfectionism and meticulous code crafting, as they are already accustomed to scanning through larger suggested code chunks with suspicion. They won't need to learn how to prompt ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot.
For them, it will be natural.
Soon, some juniors skilled in augmenting their capabilities with AI may even be preferred over senior devs who are resistant to working with these new tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a true revolution. The old class system is collapsing, and a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/EdddrKJgUJg?t=630"&gt;new one is about to be established&lt;/a&gt;. Those who quickly learn how to adapt will benefit from the shake-up, achieving successful careers and becoming respected authorities. On the other hand, those who cling to their old ways will be pushed aside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure figure-blockquote figure-tweet"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet blockquote-tweet blockquote"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;AI will not replace you. A person using AI will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figcaption class="blockquote-footer"&gt; Santiago (@svpino) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/svpino/status/1610984481342771200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 5, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may think this doesn't apply to you, right?
It's about that old fart daily commuting to a cubicle in a big office building, &lt;a href="https://vickiboykis.com/2019/05/10/it-runs-on-java-8/"&gt;working on some Java 8 systems&lt;/a&gt;.
But no, all seniors are inflexible.
Python 3.5, which introduced &lt;a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/"&gt;type hints&lt;/a&gt;, was released in 2015.
First time I tried using them in my project?
Few weeks ago.
It took me 8 years to just &lt;em&gt;try&lt;/em&gt; them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not worried that AI will replace juniors. I'm afraid that juniors, augmented by AI, may eventually replace us seniors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="closing-the-university-gap"&gt;Closing the university gap&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#closing-the-university-gap" title="Link to this heading"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already mentioned that I help people learn coding and find their first job as a dev. While I'm happy to support computer studies graduates in their efforts, my main focus is on those who are switching careers from a different job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The usual approach for career switchers is to bet on one of the most in-demand programming ecosystems, such as frontend or Python, and then laser-focus on learning it. Once they are able to produce useful code, they apply for entry-level jobs. However, as they progress in their careers and become vital members of engineering teams, they may realize that they still lack some knowledge compared to those who studied computer science at university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyday React components? Sure, no problem. But then some tasks require a deeper understanding of operating systems, algorithms, databases, and perhaps even compilers. In such cases, career switchers may either attempt to reinvent the wheel or admit that they don't know how to approach the problem and ask for guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how well-prepared university graduates were for their exams, they have been exposed to numerous subjects and concepts. While they may not remember all the details, they have a sense that solutions for certain problems already exist with specific names. Even if they don't recall them precisely, they can rely on Google for help. They may tap into an old memory, search for "philosophers fork algorithm", and find the Wikipedia page for the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem"&gt;Dining philosophers problem&lt;/a&gt; to read about the solutions. They have general overview of the field and they know what they don't know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure figure-blockquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students will understand all the layers of the computer based systems including hardware (semiconductor components, logic networks, processors, peripheral devices), software (control and data structures, object orientation, programming languages, compilers, operating systems, databases), as well as their common applications (information systems, computer networks, artificial intelligence, computer graphics and multimedia). They will understand foundations of computer science (discrete mathematics, formal languages and their models, spectral analysis of signals, modelling and simulation). Graduates will be able to analyse, design, implement, test, and maintain common computer applications. They will be able to work efficiently in teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption class="blockquote-footer"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.fit.vut.cz/study/program/7886/.en"&gt;Degree Programme Details&lt;/a&gt;, Faculty of Information Technology, Brno University of Technology&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue with career switchers is that they are often unaware of what they don't know. This means they struggle to identify what to look for and what questions to ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe this is, in essence, a problem of information discoverability. In the past, schools focused on memorizing facts to provide us with a general overview. Nowadays, schools are more relaxed, but still expect us to have a basic foundation of facts memorized. The data points we remember give us some guidance, and we can fill in the gaps &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing"&gt;just-in-time&lt;/a&gt; using the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we have access to Google and Stack Overflow, when we are trying to solve tasks, we still need to know what to search for in order to augment our abilities with existing knowledge on the topic. Conducting our own research can be tedious, as it is challenging to distinguish between noise and signal without reliable sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asking questions in the right way can also be tedious. Effectively using Google is a skill that juniors need to be trained in. Asking questions on forums can be tricky as well. The &lt;a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html"&gt;classical guide&lt;/a&gt; on how to ask questions on the internet without angering those being asked is 65,825 characters long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say I want to efficiently display billions of pins on a &lt;a href="https://leafletjs.com/"&gt;Leaflet&lt;/a&gt; map. Basic tutorials are easy to read, but won't take me far enough. Hardcore academic papers, on the other hand, are hard to read (especially on a phone screen with two-column PDFs) and may go into too much detail. Moreover, my task may have some specific requirements that make many existing resources irrelevant or difficult to apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's where LLMs, like ChatGPT, come in as the missing piece. We can simply ask this calculator for advice on how to efficiently display billions of pins on a Leaflet map, and the ensuing conversation can provide us with various existing approaches and their names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example. You know some Python and want to write a program that detects the beats per minute (BPM) of songs or do other cool things with sound. Instead of spending a week on research, a single conversation with LLM can inform you about concepts like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform"&gt;Fourier transforms&lt;/a&gt; and what they entail. It can help you to use Wolfram Alpha to calculate what you need and explain how these concepts are relevant to &lt;em&gt;your specific project&lt;/em&gt;. And if you ask nicely, it can explain everything to you in simple terms, &lt;a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/694298/what-does-eli5-mean-and-how-do-you-use-it/"&gt;like you're five&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is big! The availability of tools like ChatGPT is closing the gap between graduates and career switchers in terms of gaining a general overview. While there may still be differences in other areas, such as opportunities, contacts, and networking, when it comes to solving challenging tasks, the divide is narrowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The education system in my country has taken decades to acknowledge the existence of the internet. This is yet another blow to its outdated, 19th-century-like structure. It's high time for our society to truly contemplate what schools should be focusing on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure figure-blockquote figure-tweet"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet blockquote-tweet blockquote"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Since ChatGPT launched in Nov'22, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StackOverflow?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt; traffic dropped 24% from peak, 13% from avg. What other categories of websites - other than technical forums - got affected ? &lt;a href="https://t.co/rBctmGPPEW"&gt;pic.twitter.com/rBctmGPPEW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figcaption class="blockquote-footer"&gt; Mohamed ElAdany (@mohadany) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mohadany/status/1642544573137158144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 2, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="diversity-and-communication-skills-preferred"&gt;Diversity and communication skills preferred&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#diversity-and-communication-skills-preferred" title="Link to this heading"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also believe that tools like ChatGPT will revolutionize the skillset of developers. Nowadays, companies are increasingly valuing teamwork and collaboration skills over solitary genius traits. This shift can be challenging for some, as previous generations of developers were often individual geeks, and strong communication or teamwork skills were not prioritized in the job requirements. Those who fail to adapt may now be labeled as "brilliant jerks" and marginalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As noted by Simon Willison in his article &lt;a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Feb/21/in-defense-of-prompt-engineering/"&gt;In Defense of Prompt Engineering&lt;/a&gt;, crafting effective AI prompts requires excellent communication skills. Prompting for complex tasks can quickly become challenging without at least some background in linguistics, human psychology, philosophy, etc. In the case of image generation, those with expertise in digital art or art history have a significant advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If technical skills alone are insufficient for devs in today's world, I believe this will be even more true in the future. The question then arises: is it easier to teach coding to communicative individuals with backgrounds in art or psychology, or to enhance the communication skills of professional coders? I believe the former is more likely, and career switchers have a significant advantage in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/podcast/"&gt;our latest podcast episode&lt;/a&gt; (in Czech), Marián Kameništák also mentions that companies may start preferring domain knowledge over technical skills. We are already witnessing career transitions from accountants, artists, dentists, biologists, train drivers, bankers, chemists, and other diverse fields to the tech industry. These folks bring unique domain expertise as well as diverse backgrounds to the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already know that solutions are better tailored to people's needs when they are developed by a diverse group of devs. Diversity in tech is not just about "women in tech", it goes as far as "single parents in tech", "remote mountain dwellers in tech," or "former dentists in tech". And I believe that in the era of AI-augmented software engineering, the importance of diversity in the industry will only become more apparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="llms-are-not-replacing-all-devs"&gt;LLMs are not replacing all devs&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#llms-are-not-replacing-all-devs" title="Link to this heading"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is it even worth learning coding anymore? What if AI becomes so advanced that it can not only generate basic "hello world" React components, but entire apps and complex systems? What if it becomes capable of understanding and maintaining all legacy codebases, ultimately making software engineers obsolete? Josh Comeau already wrote what I think about this, so let me quote from his article &lt;a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/blog/the-end-of-frontend-development/"&gt;The End of Front-End Development&lt;/a&gt; (which is definitely worth reading in its entirety):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure figure-blockquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…there is an &lt;em&gt;enormous&lt;/em&gt; difference between generating a 50-line HTML document and spitting out a production-ready web application. (…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with 95% accuracy rate, this would be &lt;em&gt;incredibly&lt;/em&gt; difficult to debug. It would be like a developer spending &lt;em&gt;months&lt;/em&gt; building a huge project, without &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; actually trying to run any of the code, until it was 100% finished. This is the stuff of nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI isn't magic. It's only as good as its training data. Code &lt;em&gt;snippets&lt;/em&gt; are all over the internet, and are often generic. By contrast, every &lt;em&gt;codebase&lt;/em&gt; is unique. There are very few large open-source codebases. How's the AI supposed to learn how to build big real-world projects?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're very quickly reaching the point where non-developers can sit down with a chatbot and crank out a small self-contained project, the sort of thing that folks currently use tools like Webflow to build. And that's awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think we're still a &lt;em&gt;very long way&lt;/em&gt; from major tech companies letting go of their developer staff and replacing them with prompt engineers. It seems to me like there are several potentially-unsolveable problems that stand in the way of this becoming a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(…) My personal belief is that for the most part, working professionals will find ways to integrate this technology into their workflows, increasing their productivity and value. Certain &lt;em&gt;tasks&lt;/em&gt; might be delegated to an AI, but not many &lt;em&gt;jobs&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption class="blockquote-footer"&gt; Josh Comeau, &lt;a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/blog/the-end-of-frontend-development/"&gt;The End of Front-End Development&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, I think that software engineering is about understanding peoples' needs and translating them to a &lt;em&gt;very comprehensive and precise specification&lt;/em&gt;. And that spec is called code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Commit Strip" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/strip-les-specs-cest-du-code-650-finalenglish.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figure-caption"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code is the best representation of what should happen when, and cannot be fully replaced by vaguely worded prompts. While code initially emerged as a set of technical instructions for computers, since the advent of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language"&gt;high-level programming languages&lt;/a&gt; we're gradually stepping up the abstraction ladder. I believe that today, a majority of the code written is closer to describing &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_logic"&gt;business logic&lt;/a&gt; rather than managing memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code is transforming from being a contract between humans and computers to a contract between humans themselves. While LLMs can indeed augment our ability to draft these contracts, I hold the belief that the essential task of understanding people's needs and accurately translating them into that &lt;em&gt;precise spec&lt;/em&gt; cannot be fully automated. We will continue to perform the same job, just at a higher level of abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="devaluation-of-devs"&gt;Devaluation of devs&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#devaluation-of-devs" title="Link to this heading"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me repeat and point out this part I already quoted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure figure-blockquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're very quickly reaching the point where non-developers can sit down with a chatbot and crank out a small self-contained project, the sort of thing that folks currently use tools like Webflow to build. And that's awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption class="blockquote-footer"&gt; Josh Comeau, &lt;a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/blog/the-end-of-frontend-development/"&gt;The End of Front-End Development&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I see this already happening. My friend &lt;a href="https://www.jirichlebus.cz/"&gt;Jiří Chlebus&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent freelance designer, but his dream is to build his own product. For years he's been working on an app that disrupts graphic manuals, &lt;a href="https://visualbook.pro/"&gt;Visualbook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He doesn't know how to code, so he was left with learning random bits from the internet, gluing no-code building blocks, and getting advice from friends. ChatGPT has changed everything for him. He can do things he didn't think he'd be able to do. Translating the app to multiple languages took him a fraction of the time, because ChatGPT is able to translate whole HTML chunks. It's dope!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this illustrate?
AI not only makes the transition from junior to senior dev faster and easier, but it goes as far as democratizing coding for the masses. This is good for the progress of humankind, but will have consequences for devs. I see two possible scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="insatiable-demand-for-devs"&gt;Insatiable demand for devs&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#insatiable-demand-for-devs" title="Link to this heading"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one scenario, AI could potentially increase the supply of developers who are "good enough", which would help to balance out the seemingly insatiable demand. Such end of the scarcity would mean, first of all, drop of our high salaries.
Perhaps also end to the elevated celebrity status of our occupation.
This would be good for the society though, as developing software becomes easier and cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we are currently experiencing an economic downturn, I believe that this is just a temporary detour caused by current geopolitical factors. According to a 2018 poll conducted by the &lt;a href="https://www.czso.cz/csu/czso/na-trhu-je-nedostatek-ict-odborniku"&gt;Czech Statistical Office&lt;/a&gt;, two-thirds of Czech companies reported difficulties in filling IT roles. Furthermore, the State of European Tech survey in 2018 revealed that &lt;a href="https://2018.stateofeuropeantech.com/"&gt;IT is growing five times faster than any other segment&lt;/a&gt;. In 2021, the same survey projected that a staggering &lt;a href="https://2021.stateofeuropeantech.com/"&gt;$100B has been invested to European IT in just one year&lt;/a&gt;, which is ten times more than when the survey started in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While your present personal experience as a junior dev struggling to get invited for interviews may feel different, the long-term global trend is clear. As more and more human activity shifts to the internet, computers, and phones, backed by software engineering to a greater extent, the demand for developers is expected to continue to rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question remains, how much would the supply of "good enough" developers need to increase in order to balance out this demand? Are we talking about tens of thousands of newcomers entering the field? Perhaps hundreds of thousands? And how long would it take for them to undergo training and become "good enough," even with the assistance of ChatGPT?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="induced-demand-for-devs"&gt;Induced demand for devs&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#induced-demand-for-devs" title="Link to this heading"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another scenario, which I believe is more likely, there will be &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand"&gt;induced demand&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is induced demand? If an additional lane is added to a congested highway, it may initially seem like it would reduce congestion. However, as the paradox of induced demand describes, making commuting by car easier, more accessible, and more comfortable can actually lead to more people using cars and utilizing the new lane. Similarly, if cycling paths in a city are &lt;a href="https://mestemnakole.cz/en/prague-cycle-route-system/"&gt;unsafe or scarce&lt;/a&gt;, they won't be widely used. As soon as you make them easy to use, you suddenly &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/mar/12/europe-cycling-post-covid-recovery-plans"&gt;generate hundreds of cyclists&lt;/a&gt; who didn't exist previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone can make music, and that is awesome.
Anyone can sing, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=bucket+drummer"&gt;flip a few plastic buckets&lt;/a&gt;, or install &lt;a href="https://lmms.io/"&gt;LMMS&lt;/a&gt;.
YouTube is filled of lessons and tutorials, making it easier than ever to learn to play musical instruments.
Anyone can employ their creativity and make their own music.
Does it mean there are no professional musicians?
No.
Do LMMS and YouTube augment everyones' abilities and make us all more ambitious?
Yes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine what it took to be a photographer in the 19th century.
Today, everyone has a camera in their phone, and it's common for people to capture tens, and even hundreds of photos every day.
Did it make the photographer profession go away?
Did employing AI in modern professional cameras make the occupation disappear?
No.
Does it augment everyones' abilities and make us all more ambitious?
Yes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure figure-blockquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, the number of professional photographers has been &lt;em&gt;increasing&lt;/em&gt;, year over year. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics expects the number of jobs to increase 9% year-over-year for the next decade. For context, the average across all industries is 5%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption class="blockquote-footer"&gt; Josh Comeau, &lt;a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/blog/the-end-of-frontend-development/"&gt;The End of Front-End Development&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;With platforms like WordPress, Webflow, Wix, Shopify, and the rise of the "no-code" and "low-code" hype, people already have the ability to solve coding problems on their own without extensive coding skills.
And that's good!
Some don't even need that, because for their business it's just enough to have an Instagram profile with a few photos and a phone number.
This didn't make devs redundant.
It opened up new opportunities and we could move to more ambitious projects, such as custom development and SaaS applications, where our expertise is still highly valued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All professionals, be it musicians, photographers, or devs, possess one important quality:
They know what they're doing, and why.
The ease and accesibility of taking pictures didn't lead to wedding photographers going bankrupt.
Rather, it enabled ordinary people to take pictures of their butts.
Or coffee cups.
Or dogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paradox of induced demand applies to your personal life, too. Did washing machines, robot vacuums, or smartphones make you more relaxed than your ancestors? No. It allowed you to be more ambitious. Your ancestors knew they could fit two activities into their day and wished they could manage to get five done. You can fit 20 and wish you could manage to get 50 done. Guess what happens with LLMs like ChatGPT? Let me quote Simon Willison:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure figure-blockquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an experienced developer, ChatGPT (and GitHub Copilot) save me an enormous amount of “figuring things out” time. For everything from writing a for loop in Bash to remembering how to make a cross-domain CORS request in JavaScript—I don’t need to even look things up any more, I can just prompt it and get the right answer 80% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t just make me more productive: it lowers my bar for when a project is worth investing time in at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past I’ve had plenty of ideas for projects which I’ve ruled out because they would take a day—or days—of work to get to a point where they’re useful. I have enough other stuff to build already!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if ChatGPT can drop that down to an hour or less, those projects can suddenly become viable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption class="blockquote-footer"&gt; Simon Willison, &lt;a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Mar/27/ai-enhanced-development/"&gt;AI-enhanced development makes me more ambitious with my projects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that AI-augmented Simon is as capable as a team of devs doesn't lead to devs losing jobs. It leads to Simon being able to do more tasks that were not possible before. If building software becomes easier and more accessible, it will only make us all more ambitious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="more-indie-hackers"&gt;More indie hackers&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#more-indie-hackers" title="Link to this heading"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will definitely be a shake-up in the job market though. If a company needed 100 people to do something and now only 10 are enough, this will have a significant impact. In smart companies, the remaining 90 people will be reassigned to work on ambitious projects the company didn't think could be working on before. In other companies, however, the 90 people may lose their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, after a layoff, those people can now explore new opportunities that they probably wouldn't have even dreamed of before. Tim Ferriss' book, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_4-Hour_Workweek"&gt;The 4-Hour Workweek&lt;/a&gt;, advises people to check their email only once a day and outsource small daily tasks to &lt;em&gt;virtual assistants&lt;/em&gt;. Since 2007! I guess this option will now become more viable than ever, at least until the majority catches up with all the new technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let's say you want to add value to this world. New tools for content creators, such as YouTube or Substack, have greatly augmented people's abilities to the point that careers such as newsletter author, podcast host, beauty influencer, YouTube video producer, or Twitch streamer now seem viable. The same trend will likely happen with startups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://levels.io/"&gt;Pieter Levels&lt;/a&gt; gained fame for showcasing how tools like &lt;a href="https://stripe.com/"&gt;Stripe&lt;/a&gt; make it possible to build an entire startup product as a single person. There are already &lt;a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/"&gt;communities of indie hackers&lt;/a&gt; and individual makers who aspire to have their own scalable business. Not just a freelance business where they sell their time for money, but a business that allows them to live an independent life, whatever that may mean to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If 100 employees can be replaced by 10 AI-augmented employees, then what about a single AI-augmented entrepreneur? What if one bootstrapped founder becomes as capable of delivering a product as whole teams in Silicon Valley?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as YouTube disrupted TV production and made it possible for anyone to have their own TV channel, AI has the potential to disrupt Silicon Valley. If access to capital or experienced employees becomes less crucial in delivering a useful product, could we see more apps emerging from unexpected places like &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/jessica-upani-about-python-events-in-namibia-you-have-to-be-pure-in-terms-of-your-why/"&gt;Namibia&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://blog.pythonghana.org/"&gt;Ghana&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="keep-your-fomo-at-bay"&gt;Keep your FOMO at bay&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#keep-your-fomo-at-bay" title="Link to this heading"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you might be concerned that if you're not keeping up with all the latest announcements, you're already falling behind. But let me reassure you that the majority of people in the world are not yet using ChatGPT. Keep calm!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next time you commute on a tram, take a look around and consider how many of the people you see might have their own sophisticated ChatGPT or Stable Diffusion promptbook. None? One? Two?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could potentially lead to significant societal division between those who have access to AI and those who don't. Remember how &lt;a href="https://cc.cz/sbirka-pocitacu-od-cesko-digital-pomohla-2-800-rodinam-s-online-vyukou-pod-kridla-ji-nove-bere-clovek-v-tisni/"&gt;we learned&lt;/a&gt; during the pandemic, that many families in Czechia don't even have reliable access to computers?
While there may be some opportunities for AI-induced social mobility, I'm afraid it could end up like it always does - with the rich getting richer and the privileged becoming even more privileged.
We should be definitely worried about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don't succumb to the &lt;em&gt;fear of missing out&lt;/em&gt;! The fact that you're reading this article likely means you're already among the top 0.1% of early adopters. If you've interacted with ChatGPT more than five times, you're probably among the top 0.001%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out this &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/12o29gl/gpt4_week_4_the_rise_of_agents_and_the_beginning/"&gt;weekly report on new developments in AI&lt;/a&gt;. Even experts in the field struggle to keep up. We're whitnessing a mass exploration of technology, which is easy to use and accessible to basically anyone, including children. However, much of what's out there is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hyped-up snake oil selling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demos that break when faced with inputs slightly more complex than those shown in a screencast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not as easy to use as it appears at first glance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sell me this pen" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/img-1750.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="waiting-for-products"&gt;Waiting for products&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#waiting-for-products" title="Link to this heading"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the stuff announced also isn't a proper product.
Not even the ChatGPT interface, which is officially labeled as a &lt;a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt"&gt;research preview&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/jak-jsem-si-zacal-hrat-s-generovanim-obrazku-pomoci-ai/"&gt;tried experimenting with Stable Diffusion&lt;/a&gt; on my own machine, and I was quite surprised by how challenging it is to generate images that are even remotely as appealing as those showcased online.
It's possible, but far from simple or easy.
The prompting process is convoluted, and there are numerous models, techniques, and complexities to navigate.
While Stable Diffusion is a powerful and free tool, it's still a raw resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels like learning how to prompt now is akin to learning how to build an engine, rather than learning how to drive a car for long-distance transportation.
To effectively augment our capabilities, we need real, user-friendly products.
Waiting for such products may mean missing out on the gold rush to create them, but it will make it much easier to utilize the new superpowers for other purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day, I contemplate ways to integrate AI into my own products and workflow.
If I hadn't spent so much time thinking and started working on it already, I would have been done by now.
Yet, with each new announcement every week, it feels like getting the job done is becoming simpler and simpler.
I've saved myself a lot of unnecessary work!
While I may not be the first person to integrate AI into an existing product, I believe that if I can do it in 2023, I'll still be among the first 5%.
And it's only going to get easier with time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="checking-my-bias"&gt;Checking my bias&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#checking-my-bias" title="Link to this heading"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all, folks!
Thanks for reading.
Now, the only thing left is: how can I be so sure about all this?
Well, truth be told, I'm not sure at all!
Based on the chart below, I believe I fall somewhere between the utopianist and the entrepreneur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="r/ChatGPT classes" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/ph8h1yjb6aua1.png" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figure-caption"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm an indie hacker in the business of helping more people learn coding.
Perhaps I'm only seeing what I want to see.
Maybe I've spent several days writing this just to come up with a reasoning why AI won't render my work useless and negate everything I've been doing for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog post is filled with various predictions, so it's likely to be outdated in about two weeks, if I'm lucky.
That's also why I've decided to consolidate all my thoughts on the topic into a single post.
If I were to split them, some of the individual posts could become outdated before I manage to publish them, and the whole thing wouldn't hold together anymore.
This way, at least I can say this was my wishful thinking about AI in the middle of April 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Na Velikonoce jsme odjeli k babičce.
Rozhodl jsem se, že nebudu pracovat a pojmu to jako volno.
Nevyšlo moc počasí, tak jsem přečetl hromady věcí na internetu, hrál jsem si se Stable Diffusion, plánovali jsme dovolenou, uspořádával jsem archiv rodinných fotek…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="psani"&gt;Psaní&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#psani" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Velikonoční pauzu jsem využil k napsání hned několika článků na blog:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/notion-as-a-replacement-for-pocket/"&gt;Notion as a replacement for Pocket&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/clutter-be-gone-reclaiming-reading-on-the-internet-with-a-single-button/"&gt;Clutter be gone: Reclaiming reading on the internet with a single button&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/jak-jsem-si-zacal-hrat-s-generovanim-obrazku-pomoci-ai/"&gt;Jak jsem si začal hrát s generováním obrázků pomocí AI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na další mám nápady, případně je mám i rozepsané.
Titulky anglických článků jsem začal konzultovat s ChatGPT.
Většinou je to delší konverzace, brainstorming, než že by mi to na první dobrou dalo něco, s čím bych byl spokojený.
Někdy jsem titulek vymyslel sám, ale díky podnětům, které mi poskytlo AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Že by mi to šetřilo čas se říct nedá, ale rozhodně mi to pomáhá vymyslet něco lepšího, než bych dokázal sám.
Na titulky jsem úplně marný a jejich vymýšlení mě ani nijak zvlášť nebaví.
ChatGPT tento blok odbourává.
Navíc, pokud jde o angličtinu, navrhuje mi úderná slova, která by mě samotného nenapadla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ai"&gt;AI&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#ai" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jak jsem už psal, &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/jak-jsem-si-zacal-hrat-s-generovanim-obrazku-pomoci-ai/"&gt;hrál jsem si hodně se Stable Diffusion&lt;/a&gt;.
Ale hrál jsem si i s ChatGPT a myslím, že jsem vymyslel způsob, jak jej využít na vítání nových členů v klubu, nebo na třídění nabídek práce.
Specifický způsob promptování mě napadl už dřív, ale až teď jsem to vyzkoušel a k mému velkému překvapení se zdá, že to funguje.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="ChatGPT" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid figure-img rounded" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2023-04-15-at-10-03-14-chatgpt.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="newsletter"&gt;Newsletter&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#newsletter" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;První z článků nějak záhadně přesvědčil MailChimp, že má poslat newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Newsletter" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid figure-img rounded" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2023-04-01-at-13-16-21.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To mě dost překvapilo, protože jsem měl za to, že to prostě nefunguje.
V nastavení jsem vůbec nic neměnil.
Poslalo to pak i druhý a třetí článek.
Tak jsem zvědav, jestli to pošle i tyhle poznámky!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud chcete, aby vám do mailu náhodně chodily nebo nechodily mé články, tak se &lt;a href="http://eepurl.com/ifI06H"&gt;přihlašte zde&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="opravy-na-juniorguru-a-testy"&gt;Opravy na junior.guru a testy&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#opravy-na-juniorguru-a-testy" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I přesto, že jsem měl volno, neubránil jsem se několika rychlým opravám:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jedna &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/junior-v%C3%BDvoj%C3%A1%C5%99-simula%C4%8Dn%C3%ADch-model%C5%AF-a-n%C3%A1stroj%C5%AF-pro-testov%C3%A1n%C3%AD-%C5%99%C3%ADdic%C3%ADho-sw-trak%C4%8Dn%C3%ADch-pohon%C5%AF-vhodn%C3%A9-pro-studenty-at-siemens-3541984424/?originalSubdomain=cz"&gt;nabídka práce&lt;/a&gt; měla nekonečně dlouhý titulek: „Junior vývojář simulačních modelů a nástrojů pro testování řídicího SW trakčních pohonů (vhodné pro studenty)“
    Na Discordu to spadlo, protože ten má zjevně limit na počet znaků pro název vlákna.
    Ořízl jsem to v Pythonu na menší počet znaků.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spadlo mi CI, protože jsem nedomyslel něco kolem souborů.
    Opravil jsem to a dopsal jsem k tomu testy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uvítalo to v klubu automaticky firmu, kterou to uvítat nemělo.
    Změnil jsem tedy algoritmus, kterým bot vybírá, jakou firmu uvítat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V tomto týdnu jsem hlavně doháněl e-maily a klub.
Ženu a dítě přemohla rýma, tak jsem si nedělal velké ambice a pracoval jen tak napůl.
Doplnil jsem aspoň testy pro velké množství kódu, který jsem napsal v předešlých týdnech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dnes Pavlína poslala &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/junior.guru/pull/1106"&gt;Pull Request na další díl podcastu&lt;/a&gt;, tak jsem ho připravil k vydání.
Venku to bude zítra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qa-zive-v-klubu-i-na-youtube"&gt;Q&amp;amp;A živě v klubu i na YouTube&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#qa-zive-v-klubu-i-na-youtube" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hned po příjezdu od babičky, pár hodin po tom, co jsme přijeli vlakem, jsem měl na večer plánovanou tu svou první Q&amp;amp;A.
Měl jsem trochu nervy, ale nakonec v pohodě.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Záznam je &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN235cq8xP4"&gt;tady na YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.
Je tam i replay chatu, takže jdou vidět dotazy.
Zvláštní je, že chat se nezobrazil hned po nahrání streamu, ale &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/uvygbn/comment/i9q3v9t/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;muselo se na něj počkat&lt;/a&gt;.
To mě dost zmátlo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co se týče failů, tak Tinuki ze začátku trochu přepálil zvuk a mě se vybily sluchátka, protože jsem je po cestě vlakem zapomněl nabít.
Takže konec už je bez sluchátek.
Za mě dobrý, na to, že to bylo poprvé!
Odškrtávám si jeden další velký milník a na podzim naplánuju další.
Pouhým okem mi přišlo, že počet nově příchozích do klubu se těsně před a po Q&amp;amp;A mírně zvýšil, ale nehodlám to nijak exaktně měřit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jako fail by se jinak dalo počítat i to, že můj brácha v klubu šířil inzeráty na nějaké pozice u nich ve firmě a už měl i zájemce, ale ten z toho po mé Q&amp;amp;A vycouval, protože jsem tam juniorům nedoporučil do začátku práci „na IČO“.
Ups!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Marc Rebillet" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid figure-img rounded" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2023-03-13-at-10-43-01-rainy-sunday-youtube.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figure-caption"&gt;
Přesně takhle vypadala moje Q&amp;amp;A s chatem na YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zneuzivani-14-dni-zdarma"&gt;Zneužívání 14 dní zdarma&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#zneuzivani-14-dni-zdarma" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moderátoři a jeden další člen klubu mi nezávisle na sobě dali tip, že někdo nejspíš zneužívá 14 dní zdarma v klubu.
Týpek s nápadně podobnými přezdívkami a nápadně podobnými dotazy.
Vždy, když potřebuje něco vyřešit, nejspíš dokonce do práce, udělá si nový účet, jde zdarma do klubu a využívá jej.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nechtěl jsem si kazit Velikonoce, tak jsem se na to pořádně podíval až v tomto týdnu.
A fakt že jo.
Nakonec jsem zjistil, že si takhle vytvořil dokonce osm, možná až devět účtů.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nemyslím, ze má smysl to kvůli jednomu kazit pro ostatní, tedy zavádět nějaké nové systémové pravidlo, ale zase musím ty, kdo pomáhají, trochu chránit aby věděli, ze se tady nebudou vysilovat na někoho, kdo jen bere ale nemá chuť dat něco zpátky.
Zatím jsem mu jen napsal.
Přemýšlím, co se dá s takovými lidmi dělat, aniž bych uvalil nějaké nové restrikce i na ostatní.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Zneužívání" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2023-04-14-at-20-57-53.png" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/honzajavorek_kfc-bootcamp-kurzy-activity-7048655097991450624-OIjK"&gt;Propagoval jsem&lt;/a&gt; poslední díl našeho podcastu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Udělal jsem si pořádek v jednom Trello sloupci z osmdesáti.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Komentoval jsem &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lucietvrdikova_junior-startvit-pohovor-activity-7046356549253922816-pO5N"&gt;pod LinkedIn příspěvkem o juniorech&lt;/a&gt;.
    Trochu jsem si povolil vodítko a pojal jsem to jako za starých facebookových časů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Šel jsem na &lt;a href="https://www.deloitte-digital.cz/event-page"&gt;příjemnou vývojářskou akci do Deloitte&lt;/a&gt;.
    Pěkná terasa!
    Potkal jsem tam lidi z klubu, seznámil se s nějakými novými lidmi a v baráku plném auditorů jsem se zakecal o tom, zda by šlo nějak spolupracovat a kontrolovat marketingová prohlášení vzdělávacích agentur.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Michal Kašpárek vytvořil &lt;a href="https://github.com/michalkasparek/gusta"&gt;svoje vlastní udělátko nad ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt;, tak se na to plánuji někdy brzo mrknout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přihlásil jsem se do bizarního „obrazového“ newsletteru &lt;a href="https://www.readjpeg.com/"&gt;readjpeg.com&lt;/a&gt;.
    Jsem zvědav, co mi bude chodit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Losoval jsem výherce slevy na lístky na WebExpo a pak i jednoho lístku úplně zdarma, který věnovala &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adina-foxova/"&gt;Adina&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Před časem jsem dával na Discord &lt;a href="https://mimo-agendu.ghost.io/"&gt;Mimo Agendu&lt;/a&gt; inzerát na někoho, kdo by dělal pro junior.guru rozhovory s juniory.
    A teď se mi na to někdo ozval!
    Tak jsem zvědavý, co z toho bude.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Četl jsem si &lt;a href="https://www.linkedakademie.cz/blog/"&gt;články o tom, jak mám mít vytuněný LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zjistil jsem, že RSS pro playlisty na YouTube obsahuje jen prvních pár videí od začátku, ne od konce.
    Takže pak nepřibývají nové.
    Zjišťoval jsem, zda to jde nějak řešit, ideálně bez programování, ale muselo by se jít přes API.
    Tak místo toho sleduji celé ty kanály, tam naštěstí RSS funguje tak, jak bych očekával.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Koukal jsem na &lt;a href="https://obcan.petrbrzek.cz/"&gt;ObčanGPT&lt;/a&gt; a přemýšlel, jak udělat totéž pro příručku na junior.guru.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Koukal jsem na &lt;a href="https://picocss.com/"&gt;PicoCSS&lt;/a&gt;, jestli bych na to nemohl přehodit blog.
    Štve mě, že tu nemám &lt;em&gt;dark mode&lt;/em&gt;, ale nechce se mi to vůbec řešit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Koukal jsem na &lt;a href="https://cron.com/"&gt;cron.com&lt;/a&gt; a na &lt;a href="https://retool.com/"&gt;retool.com&lt;/a&gt;, aby mi neujel vlak, ale přijde mi, že ani jedno z toho nevyužiju.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Radil jsem kamarádovi s rozjížděním &lt;a href="https://richbull.co/"&gt;RichBull&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Všiml jsem si, že na irozhlas.cz &lt;a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/pocasi/585068"&gt;je i počasí&lt;/a&gt; a že je (subjektivně, pro moje potřeby) mnohem přehlednější, než pocasi.cz.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zapnul jsem si na iCloudu &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212520"&gt;Advanced Data Protection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zapomněl jsem na call výboru Pyvce a připojil se až na posledních 10 minut.
    Domlouvám sraz s naší advokátkou, abychom probrali něco ohledně voleb do výboru.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;E-maily, &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/club/"&gt;klubový Discord&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://docs.pyvec.org/operations/support.html#sit-kontaktu"&gt;Pyvec Slack&lt;/a&gt;.
    Vyřídil jsem jedno stipendium.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 15 dní jsem naběhal 27 km, ujel na kole 29 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 8 h a zdolal při tom 56 km.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do této chvíle jsem nic o generování obrázků pomocí AI nevěděl, ani bych nedokázal říct, jaký je rozdíl mezi DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, nebo Midjourney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Procházel jsem si během volna Fireship videa, což je můj nový oblíbený kanál na YouTube.
A &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYqeHIRKboM"&gt;tohleto&lt;/a&gt; mě namotivovalo zkusit si taky vygenerovat nějaké ty obrázky.
Šel jsem na Midjourney Discord, zaregistroval se, ale napsalo mi to, že servery jsou přetížené a musím zaplatit, jestli něco chci.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To mě naštvalo.
Otevřel jsem &lt;a href="https://diffusionbee.com/"&gt;DiffusionBee&lt;/a&gt;, což je appka na macOS, která zjednodušuje použití Stable Diffusion.
To je model, který je open source a když to člověk rozchodí na svém počítači, za nic neplatí.
Už před časem jsem si DiffusionBee ze zvědavosti nainstaloval, ale neměl jsem čas to vyzkoušet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nedařilo se mi však vygenerovat žádné dobré věci, tak jsem se do toho trochu zavrtal a snažil se pochopit, co dělám blbě.
No a dost mě to chytlo.
Přidal jsem se do různých Discordů, subredditů, postahoval nějaké upravené modely, pochopil rozdíly mezi různými AI.
V noci se mi o tom zdálo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Většina lidí nepoužívá DiffusionBee, ale &lt;a href="https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui"&gt;Stable Diffusion web UI&lt;/a&gt;, které je nejspíš promakanější.
    Nezkoušel jsem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modely jde najít na &lt;a href="https://huggingface.co/"&gt;HuggingFace&lt;/a&gt;.
    DiffusionBee podporuje zatím jen některé typy.
    Zajímavé modely: &lt;a href="https://huggingface.co/prompthero/openjourney"&gt;openjourney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://huggingface.co/wavymulder/portraitplus"&gt;portraitplus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://huggingface.co/nitrosocke/Nitro-Diffusion"&gt;Nitro-Diffusion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://huggingface.co/dreamlike-art/dreamlike-photoreal-2.0"&gt;dreamlike-photoreal-2.0&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://huggingface.co/wavymulder/modelshoot"&gt;modelshoot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://huggingface.co/22h/vintedois-diffusion-v0-1"&gt;vintedois-diffusion-v0-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Prompt okopírovaný z internetu" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2023-04-08-at-14-51-54.png" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figure-caption"&gt;
Prompt okopírovaný z internetu, který náhodou dopadl dobře&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Většina promptů, které jde najít na internetu, je nepoužitelných bez dalších informací.
Výsledek závisí na modelu a na jeho nastavení: kolik pixelů na kolik, počet kroků…
Různé modely se chovají různě.
Některé dávají lepší výsledky s pětislovnými zadáními, jiné je potřeba otesávat pomocí dvaceti a více slov a třeba i s nějakými číselnými váhami nebo závorkami.
Takže samotný prompt vám je většinou k ničemu, maximálně může posloužit jako inspirace.
K tomu ještě můžete využít i negativní prompt, který by měl nějaké věci vyloučit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Můj vlastní prompt" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2023-04-09-at-18-03-39.png" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figure-caption"&gt;
Můj vlastní prompt&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nakonec jsem byl schopen generovat i celkem obstojné obrázky.
Kvalit toho, co jde najít na internetu, to však nedosahuje.
Stable Diffusion je sice zdarma, ale o to těžší je vymačkat z něj něco pořádného.
Když to srovnám v podstatě jakýmkoliv online placeným modelem, např. &lt;a href="https://lexica.art/"&gt;Lexica&lt;/a&gt;, kam napíšu tři slova, dostanu co chci a graficky je to pecka, tak nekonečné vyšívání nad Stable Diffusion je někdy k uzoufání.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O to větší respekt u mě mají všichni, kdo z toho dokážou ty dobré věci dostat.
Teď vidím, že v tom jsou hodiny a hodiny zkoušení.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hlavně ten nedeterminismus!
Dám prompt, vygeneruje to osmkrát něco jiného.
Na stejný prompt.
Jako vývojář nejsem zvyklý pracovat s něčím, kde měním vstup a výstup se sice nějak upravuje podle toho, ale někdy taky ne, a někdy si dokonce dělá úplně co chce.
I magie v pohádkách a fantasy funguje tak, že pokud správně řeknu zaklínadlo, stane se něco, co mohu očekávat a předpovídat.
Tohle je z 50 % prostě náhoda!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Časem jde oko trochu vytrénovat, najít společné rysy vygenerovaných obrázků a odtušit, jakým směrem to ladit.
Výsledkem je však závislost, jakou si představuji, že mají lidi na automatech.
Tahám za páčku, tahám tahám a toužím po třech citróncích.
Ještě jeden pokus.
Ještě.
A ještě jeden, teď už to musí vyjít…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taky jsem se přes Velikonoce hrabal ve starých fotkách a zkusil jsem upscalovat nějaké ze starých mobilů.
Některé ty fotky jsou menší než 640×480px a na mojí retině vypadají jako malý obdélníček uprostřed obrazovky.
Objevil jsem následující:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://jpghd.com/"&gt;jpgHD&lt;/a&gt;, který je online a nad rámec dema za peníze.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl"&gt;upscayl&lt;/a&gt;, který je open source a jde nainstalovat a použít lokálně.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten druhý jsem zkusil a na to, co jsem do toho dával, to mělo celkem obstojné výsledky.
Možná by to ale šlo i líp.
Možná by k tomu šlo použít i to Stable Diffusion!
Jenže to jsem zatím nezkoumal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud jste ve zkoušení dál než já, dejte vědět nějaké tipy!
A jestli jste ještě Stable Diffusion nezkoušeli, třeba vám tenhle článek pomůže začít.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category></entry><entry><title>Clutter be gone: Reclaiming reading on the internet with a single button</title><link href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/clutter-be-gone-reclaiming-reading-on-the-internet-with-a-single-button/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-04-07T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2023-04-07T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Honza Javorek</name></author><id>tag:honzajavorek.cz,2023-04-07:/blog/clutter-be-gone-reclaiming-reading-on-the-internet-with-a-single-button/</id><summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you tired of reading through the clutter of cookie prompts, advertisements, and notification prompts?

What if I told you there is a single magic button which gets you just the information you're interested in?
And what if you don't need to install any extensions, because this button is already in your browser?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Clutter be gone: The art of reading articles online" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2023-04-07-at-11-18-52.png" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figure-caption"&gt;
The &lt;a href="https://www.e15.cz/"&gt;E15 magazine homepage&lt;/a&gt; in Google Chrome&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="why-ad-blockers-suck"&gt;Why ad blockers suck&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#why-ad-blockers-suck" title="Link to this heading"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The screenshot above is just an example of how the current internet experience looks like for a regular user.
On desktop I use &lt;a href="https://ublockorigin.com/"&gt;uBlock Origin&lt;/a&gt; to eliminate most of the clutter, but it has a few drawbacks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need to install the extension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes it breaks websites and you need to remind yourself that the ad blocker could be the reason.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it breaks a website, you need to figure out some exception rules in the clunky UI of the extension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It isn't available for phones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It requires my trust, because I give it permission to do basically anything on any page I'm browsing.
    Effectively, the extension is a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack"&gt;Man-in-the-middle&lt;/a&gt;.
    It is like police, a thing which is legally allowed to use force to keep order, but can easily get out of hand if unchecked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above points are okay-ish for me, a power user with affinity to make my life a bit more miserable for the sake of privacy and better internet experience.
However, they're deal breakers for regular users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, half of my browsing and reading happens to be on my phone.
Yeah, there is a thing called AdGuard and others, but here we are again with the trust.
The installation step where I'm supposed to give it permissions to do almost anything with my phone makes me uneasy.
And even though I gave it the access, I didn't manage to get it working properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="why-this-all-is-so-annoying"&gt;Why this all is so annoying&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#why-this-all-is-so-annoying" title="Link to this heading"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If clicking on cookie clutter and avoiding ads is annoying on desktop, on a phone it is downright infuriating.
You want to get stuff done quickly, because you're in a tram and need to check something.
Or perhaps quietly, because you're reading while someone is sleeping next to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You open a link and—cookies! Video ads! Pop-ups!
Websites forcing you to play a fat-fingering game, different kinds, different levels of difficulty.
Exhausting your patience.
Making your short stay in this world shorter and more miserable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On iPhone, you can long-press any link and get a preview of what you're clicking on.
In the preview, you might see the title, the lead paragraph, the main photo, right?
You can then decide whether you want to actually go to that page, read it later, or let it be.
You know what all my previews look like?
Like a giant cookie prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="iPhone preview" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/img-2735.png" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figure-caption"&gt;
The title of the cookie prompt starts with: „Do you enjoy our content?“ What?! What content are you even talking about?&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also how all websites my in-app browsers look like.
Even if I confirm the cookie prompt in the standalone Safari, the in-app browser windows don't share cookies with it, so I'm prompted again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a beard, I'm an old man.
I remember how the web used to be.
Yes, we had banners.
Yes, we had pop-up windows.
But back then, the browsers at least didn't collaborate with advertisers.
They seemed to care about user experience.
They guarded us against the most infuriating practices, so we could have a better time reading the internet.
Today, Google Chrome has a monopoly.
A browser developed by an advertising company.
As of now it takes &lt;a href="https://cookie-script.com/blog/google-delays-blocking-third-party-cookies"&gt;four years of delays&lt;/a&gt; to implement even the most basic protection of its users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go here: &lt;a href="https://how-i-experience-web-today.com/"&gt;how-i-experience-web-today.com&lt;/a&gt;
Laughing or crying?
I'm crying, because I've been laughing for too long and after a decade of more and more of these obstructions, I feel like it's just not funny anymore.
Coping by joking stopped working for me.
We, users of the internet, need to take action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it didn't produce CO₂, I'd wish the most infuriating websites burned down.
It does produce CO₂ to burn servers and my tapping fingers don't have the superpower to do it anyway, so I'm left with looking for a different approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yes-to-privacy-aware-browsers-and-reader-modes"&gt;Yes to privacy-aware browsers and reader modes&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#yes-to-privacy-aware-browsers-and-reader-modes" title="Link to this heading"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use browsers which at least pretend to protect users by blocking the most basic stuff.
I use Firefox on my desktop and Safari on my phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both these browsers also feature a magic button, which hides everything but content on any given page.
It's quite hidden, but it's there:
See &lt;a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-reader-view-clutter-free-web-pages"&gt;how-to for Firefox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/hide-ads-when-reading-sfri32632/mac"&gt;how-to for Safari&lt;/a&gt;.
It's called Reader Mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Reader Mode in Safari" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2023-04-07-at-11-20-42.png" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Reader Mode in Firefox" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2023-04-07-at-11-21-46.png" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It respects your dark mode settings, so no more bleeding eyes from white backgrounds when you're trying to read something in the middle of the night.
Not sure about Safari, but Firefox offers font settings and is even able to read the article out loud by a robotic voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best thing is that you don't need to click on anything else.
You land on a page?
Don't mind any pop-ups, cookie prompts, or ads.
Just hit the Reader Mode button and be done with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, actually, you know what's even better?
I discovered that Safari has an option to turn this on by default!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Reader Mode by default on desktop" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2023-04-07-at-12-09-00.png" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Reader Mode by default on iOS" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/img-2733.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I use Safari on my phone, this is pure bliss.
Liberation.
Deliverance!
I don't have to tap on anything anymore.
Most of the stuff I open turns into a nice column of text, immediately and automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I don't want it turned on or it doesn't process the page well.
But I figured out this is a minority of pages I open and I'm okay to do the single tap to opt-out, case by case.
Majority of the websites are utter mess though, so to me, ocassionally opting-out from Reader Mode makes more sense than opting-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="is-it-ethical"&gt;Is it ethical?&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#is-it-ethical" title="Link to this heading"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about those poor content providers relying on ads?
Well, in the first place, nobody asked me whether it's ethical to track me everywhere and fuck up the internet to the extent it's almost unusable in its default form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I refuse personal responsibility, I don't care how ethical this is.
This is coping.
Surviving in a broken and fucked-up system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may say: If you don't like it, don't visit that website!
If you don't display ads, you're a stowaway!
Well this works only until you actually have a choice.
The internet got to a state where it's practically impossible to implement a personal policy of avoiding annoying websites.
All of them are annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Old man yells at cloud" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/3ad-1362626647.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do play the meaningless personal responsibility game to make the world a better place, but I have to choose battles.
I'm already drinking from pulpy paper straws and I sort my trash by colors to fight climate change.
I don't have any capacity left to click on cookie prompts and watch ads to save the publishers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Folks, let's be honest.
If you didn't put the ads all over that page, I wouldn't be motivated to block them.
If you didn't track me, there would be no cookie prompts to avoid.
If you didn't prompt me to do five hops before I'm able to get to the content, I wouldn't be giving up on how you designed the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/"&gt;junior.guru&lt;/a&gt; currently &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;earns 2.322€ net profit per month&lt;/a&gt; and it doesn't have ads, tracking cookies, nor newsletter prompts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, I do have some &lt;a href="https://simpleanalytics.com/junior.guru"&gt;analytics&lt;/a&gt;.
Detailed analytics based on tracking people are overrated.
And it's an evil thing to do.
That's why the EU wants you to stop doing this!
If you cannot figure out a better business model than one based on tracking me, I have no respect.
Protecting my internet privacy and experience takes priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category></entry><entry><title>Notion as a replacement for Pocket</title><link href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/notion-as-a-replacement-for-pocket/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-04-01T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2023-04-01T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Honza Javorek</name></author><id>tag:honzajavorek.cz,2023-04-01:/blog/notion-as-a-replacement-for-pocket/</id><summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know &lt;a href="https://www.notion.so/"&gt;Notion&lt;/a&gt; exists, but until now I didn't pay much attention to it.
With my recent transition from social media and &lt;a href="https://getpocket.com/"&gt;Pocket&lt;/a&gt; to good old RSS feeds, I've been looking for a way to save random internet articles to a single feed, which I could then put to my …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know &lt;a href="https://www.notion.so/"&gt;Notion&lt;/a&gt; exists, but until now I didn't pay much attention to it.
With my recent transition from social media and &lt;a href="https://getpocket.com/"&gt;Pocket&lt;/a&gt; to good old RSS feeds, I've been looking for a way to save random internet articles to a single feed, which I could then put to my RSS reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a hunch that Notion could help me with that (and perhaps with other stuff, too!) so I've finally found some time to properly play with it.
And indeed, it can really work as a replacement for Pocket, with a little bit of coding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Notion as a replacement for Pocket" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2023-03-26-at-16-13-57.png" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with Pocket is that there is no good way how to get the articles out of it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has RSS feeds, but they only contain 30 items.
    That is a fact which I not only observed, but also confirmed with their support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has &lt;a href="https://getpocket.com/export"&gt;data export&lt;/a&gt;, but I'd need to somehow scrape that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has an API, but it's 3-legged OAuth 2.0, which means it requires user interaction.
    Such APIs are useless for unattended personal automation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I tried Notion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've made a Notion page with a "database".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've installed Notion on my phone and I've added their &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/notion-web-clipper/"&gt;Web Clipper&lt;/a&gt; to my browser.
    At this point I had a place where to put links and an easy way to put them there from all my devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've looked at their API and I was very pleasantly surprised!
    It has amazing docs.
    It has an unrivaled approach to auth.
    Everything is very well explained.
    If I want access only to my own data, I just click at the right buttons to get my "integration" created, I get an API token and I can do anything I want with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've struggled a bit with a step where I was supposed to share the page with my "integration", because I've been following a tutorial which was based on outdated UI.
    Without this step the "integration" doesn't see the page and can't access the data.
    It took me a while to figure it out, but I like that the permissions are so fine-grained!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a very short time I've been able to write a &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/honzajavorek.cz/blob/a762d2a548dca6f5437930d0c2a10358198e7ac9/blog/reading.py"&gt;Python script&lt;/a&gt;, which uses &lt;a href="https://github.com/ramnes/notion-sdk-py"&gt;notion-sdk-py&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/lkiesow/python-feedgen"&gt;python-feedgen&lt;/a&gt;.
    It reads the links and generates RSS.
    The core of the program has exactly 15 lines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I use GitHub Actions to generate the file once in a few days and publish it to GitHub Pages.
    I've added the URL of my RSS to &lt;a href="https://netnewswire.com/"&gt;NetNewsWire&lt;/a&gt;.
    Done!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I can browse the internet and easily send random articles to my RSS reader.
As a bonus, I have the history in my Notion.
With reader mode (&lt;a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-reader-view-clutter-free-web-pages"&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/hide-ads-when-reading-sfri32632/mac"&gt;Safari&lt;/a&gt;), the reading is as comfortable as in Pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot nastavení přístupu do Notion API" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid figure-img rounded" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2023-03-31-at-16-07-01-notion-the-all-in-one-workspace-for-your-notes-tasks-wikis-and-databases.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figure-caption"&gt;
Notion API auth setup&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides using Notion for storing links to read, I'll probably move my notes there, too.
I'm not satisfied with Apple Notes and I think Notion might be better fit even for some stuff I use Trello for.
I really like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The flexibility about what you can put there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Combination of text and machine-readable data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ease of use of their API.
    I can invent all sorts of personal automations like this.
    It feels like my data is there for me to work with, it's not a hostage to their walled garden.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They even &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DIn0Ws9yTE"&gt;have AI now&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm curious about what else I can build on top of this all.
A page with my personal to-do or with bookmarks related to vacation planning might be a good beginning to get a grip of the UI, but the tool feels much, much more powerful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus:&lt;/strong&gt; When doing some research, I stumbled upon these two additional links: &lt;a href="https://github.com/FujiHaruka/notion-into-sqlite"&gt;notion-into-sqlite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://datasette.io/tools/apple-notes-to-sqlite"&gt;apple-notes-to-sqlite&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category></entry><entry><title>Týdenní poznámky: Rychlejší špendlíky a AI</title><link href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/tydenni-poznamky-rychlejsi-spendliky-a-ai/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-03-31T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2023-03-31T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Honza Javorek</name></author><id>tag:honzajavorek.cz,2023-03-31:/blog/tydenni-poznamky-rychlejsi-spendliky-a-ai/</id><summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jak se mi daří v jednom člověku provozovat a rozvíjet &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/"&gt;junior.guru&lt;/a&gt;?

&lt;h2 id="rychlejsi-spendliky"&gt;Rychlejší špendlíky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#rychlejsi-spendliky" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Většinu týdne jsem se hrabal v kódu, ale na rozdíl od minula z toho mám při pátku dobrý pocit.
Když někdo v klubu přidá reakci špendlíku 📌 k nějaké zprávě, můj bot mu ji uloží do soukromých zpráv.
Je to užitečné, ale jak jsem psal minule, toto ukládání nebylo naprogramované dobře a trvalo už skoro 10 minut.
Během týdne se mi to povedlo zrychlit na 0.3 minut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Z minulého týdne jsem měl hotové šifrování databáze, takže jsem do ní mohl začít ukládat i neveřejné věci.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přebudoval jsem bota, aby stahoval do databáze i obsah soukromých zpráv.
    Díky tomu se nemusí špendlíky ověřovat přes API.
    Zprávy už jsou v databázi a lze v tom pohodlně lokálně hledat přes SQL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uložil jsem si ke každé zprávě, zda je veřejná nebo soukromá a upravil všechny dotazy a operace tak, aby to respektovaly.
    Jako soukromé jsem označil i zprávy, které jsou v kanálech, kam nemají přístup všichni z klubu.
    Všechen ostatní kód jsem upravil tak, aby počítal s tím, že kanály mohou být jak veřejné, tak i soukromé.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kód celého „stahovače“ zpráv z Discordu do databáze jsem přebudoval od základů a nejspíš i zefektivnil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mnoho věcí jsem předělal tak, aby se děly už při ukládání do databáze a pak se mohly jen číst a prohledávat, ne aby se to řešilo za běhu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na ukládání globálního stavu, ať už jde o nastavení služeb, do kterých má program povolené zapisovat, nebo nastavení logování, jsem použil &lt;em&gt;environment variables&lt;/em&gt;.
    Při použití &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html"&gt;multiprocessing&lt;/a&gt; to bylo nejvíc &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle"&gt;KISS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moc jsem toho neotestoval, takže to bych měl v ideálním případě dodělat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Špendlík" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2023-03-31-at-17-04-29.png" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="objevovani-asyncio"&gt;Objevování asyncio&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#objevovani-asyncio" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když už mám ten Python 3.11, tak jsem chtěl použít místo &lt;code&gt;asyncio.gather()&lt;/code&gt; novinku, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#task-groups"&gt;task groups&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.
Začal jsem se však dostávat do obskurních problémů, od &lt;em&gt;segmentation fault&lt;/em&gt; až po &lt;a href="https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord/issues/1986"&gt;visící program neschopný zpracovat výjimku&lt;/a&gt; (pod &lt;em&gt;issue&lt;/em&gt; je komentář s vysvětlením, proč se to děje).
Zabil jsem s tím jedno dopoledne a pak jsem to z kódu raději vyházel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naučil jsem se však při tom, že nemusím na &lt;code&gt;asyncio&lt;/code&gt; tasky čekat hned, že je mohu vytvářet a až postupně si sbírat jejich výsledky, klidně třeba zrovna přes &lt;code&gt;asyncio.gather()&lt;/code&gt;.
Zní to triviálně, ale mě to původně fakt nedošlo.
Všechny příklady totiž vždy vypadají takto:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;asyncio&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;asyncio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gather&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;something&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;something&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;something&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Takže až teď mi došlo, že můžu udělat tohle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;asyncio&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;tasks&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;tasks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;asyncio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;create_task&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;something&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;tasks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;asyncio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;create_task&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;something&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;tasks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;asyncio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;create_task&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;something&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;asyncio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gather&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tasks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A ty věci se začnou dělat už při volání &lt;code&gt;asyncio.create_task()&lt;/code&gt;.
Aspoň teda myslím.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taky jsem zjistil, že synchronní věci mohu velmi snadno volat pomocí &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.loop.run_in_executor"&gt;něčeho, co se jmenuje &lt;em&gt;executor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a nebudou mi nic blokovat.
To je perfektní, protože tím můžu obalit volání do databáze, která mám synchronní.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celé mě to přivedlo na myšlenku, že by možná měl být celý backend junior.guru asynchronní a do synchronních věcí by si to mělo jen odskakovat 🤯
Protože těch asynchronních věcí je tam čím dál víc a odskakuje se do nich dost složitě (v podstatě spouštím celý nový proces a v něm &lt;em&gt;loop&lt;/em&gt;), zatímco z asynchronních do synchronních se odskakuje snadno.
Jenže to by znamenalo v podstatě všechno přepsat a to je samozřejmě blbost.
Uvidím, jestli mě napadne nějaké řešení, které by na to šlo postupně.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Každopádně se postupně víc a víc seznamuji s &lt;code&gt;asyncio&lt;/code&gt;, které jsem ještě před nedávnem vůbec neuměl.
A vlastně se mi to celkem líbí.
Škoda, že zatím není víc high-level věcí jako např. &lt;code&gt;TaskGroup()&lt;/code&gt;, které by obalily občas nevzhledné přehazování &lt;em&gt;tasků&lt;/em&gt; vidlema sem a tam.
A škoda, že když už něco jako &lt;code&gt;TaskGroup()&lt;/code&gt; existuje, tak to dost zvláštně (ne)funguje.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taky je škoda, že jsem se rozhodl použít &lt;a href="http://docs.peewee-orm.com/"&gt;Peewee&lt;/a&gt;, které sice má nějakou &lt;a href="https://github.com/05bit/peewee-async"&gt;asynchronní verzi&lt;/a&gt;, ale ta zase nepodporuje SQLite.
Věřím, že mainstreamovější SQLAlchemy by zvládla všechno.
Ani nevím, proč jsem kdysi vybral zrovna Peewee.
Možná jsem měl dojem, že na ty moje dvě tři tabulky bude stačit něco minimalistického.
Tak teď mám tabulek třicet nebo kolik, v nich desetitisíce záznamů…
Přejít z jednoho ORM na druhé by byla samozřejmě šílená práce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VS Code mi přestal z neznámého důvodu napovídat, tak jsem něco poklikal v nastavení a napovídat zase začal.
Ale zaškrtl jsem i něco, co se jmenuje &lt;em&gt;inlay hints&lt;/em&gt; a teď mi to ukazuje, co si VS Code myslí, že funkce vrací, nebo jaké mají parametry typy.
No a když už jsem to tam viděl, tak jsem tam ty typy začal dopisovat.
Poprvé v životě jsem sám od sebe v Pythonu použil typy.
A když jsem je tam už měl, tak, světe div se, začalo VS Code napovídat ještě o dost lépe!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Inlay hint" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2023-03-31-at-17-06-02.png" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Je to návykové.
Zatím se to celé teprve učím, ale líbí se mi to.
Na malé programy nebo prototypy je to zbytečné, ale přesně na kód, který jsem teď psal, je to super.
Ukládání Discord &lt;code&gt;message&lt;/code&gt; do databáze, vytahování &lt;code&gt;message&lt;/code&gt; z databáze, proměnné se jmenují stejně, ale každá má jiný typ…
Zmatek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No a když už jsem byl u toho, řekl jsem si, že zkusím i &lt;a href="https://github.com/features/copilot"&gt;GitHub Copilot&lt;/a&gt;.
Je to na 60 dní zdarma.
Když to bude dobré, budu za to klidně platit.
Kdo jiný než sólo programátor a podnikatel by měl víc benefitovat z toho, že mu bude AI napovídat?
V korporátech jim bude trvat roky, než vůbec svým lidem povolí takové věci používat.
Já to můžu používat hned a věřím, že vložené peníze se mi mnohonásobně vrátí.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;První dojmy?
Nuže, napovídá to při psaní.
Bál jsem se, že mě to bude štvát, že mi bude každou chvíli napovídat nějakou blbost, ale vůbec.
A zatím většina věcí, co napoví, se mi celkem hodí.
Asi to vyladili tak, že napovídá jen když si fakt věří, že napovídá něco užitečného.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akorát na to nejsem zvyklý, takže mě vždy strašně překvapí, když mi napoví celý kus kódu a já to odkliknu a je to napsané. Nejdřív na to čumím jako na zázrak, pak na to čumím, jestli je to fakt dobře.
Tím pádem se jakákoliv úspora zatím stírá 😀&lt;/p&gt;

Tyto dvě funkce za mě napsal GitHub Copilot, stačilo začít názvem. A pak se podívat, zda nenapsal blbost.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O víkendu jsem se podíval na &lt;a href="https://www.notion.so/"&gt;Notion&lt;/a&gt;.
Vím o téhle věci už dlouho, ale vždy jsem to pouze viděl používat ostatní, nikdy jsem si s tím nezkoušel hrát sám.
Hned se mi to zalíbilo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Přesunul jsem tam okamžitě svoje Tudů na běžné dny, udělal jsem si tam stránku s odkazy na dovolenou, zapsal jsem si tam nějaké úkoly související s úklidem v osobních a rodinných financích, apod.
Nejspíš to budu používat místo Apple Notes, které se mi nakonec nepoužívají moc dobře, a možná i místo Trella.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Také jsem si tam udělal seznam zajímavých odkazů k AI a seznam odkazů na články, které bych si mohl chtít přečíst.
Jak jsem psal minule, &lt;a href="https://getpocket.com/"&gt;Pocket&lt;/a&gt; nemá z více důvodů použitelné RSS a má OAuth 2.0 API (tzn. API k ničemu), takže jsem to zkusil vytvořit s Notionem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V Notion jsem si udělal databázi na odkazy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nainstaloval jsem si Notion na mobil a do prohlížeče jsem si dal jejich &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/notion-web-clipper/"&gt;Web Clipper&lt;/a&gt;.
    Snadné přidávání vyřešeno.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mrkl jsem na jejich API a byl jsem unešen z toho, jak jednoduše a prakticky je vyřešen přístup do něj.
    Jde to přehledně naklikat a vše je perfektně vysvětlené a zcela zřejmé.
    Pokud chcete přístup jen ke svým datům, tak nemusíte nic řešit a jedete přes token, žádné OAuth 2.0 s interakcí.
    A celá dokumentace k API je hodně promakaná.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Za chviličku jsem měl hotový &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/honzajavorek.cz/blob/main/blog/reading.py"&gt;skript&lt;/a&gt;, který používá &lt;a href="https://github.com/ramnes/notion-sdk-py"&gt;notion-sdk-py&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://github.com/lkiesow/python-feedgen"&gt;python-feedgen&lt;/a&gt;.
    Přečte odkazy a vygeneruje RSS.
    Jádro programu má přesně 15 řádků.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dal jsem si to na GitHub a jednou za čas se mi přes GitHub Actions vygeneruje RSS soubor.
    Ten jsem si přidal do &lt;a href="https://netnewswire.com/"&gt;NetNewsWire&lt;/a&gt; a hotovo!
    Teď mohu chodit po internetu a posílat si náhodné články do RSS čtečky a ještě mám jejich databázi v Notionu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Notion" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2023-03-26-at-16-14-39.png" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figure-caption"&gt;
Databáze odkazů&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot nastavení přístupu do Notion API" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid figure-img rounded" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2023-03-31-at-16-07-01-notion-the-all-in-one-workspace-for-your-notes-tasks-wikis-and-databases.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figure-caption"&gt;

Výsledek!&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když už jsem tyhle věci zkoumal, tak pokud by někdo chtěl vysypat věci z Notion nebo Apple Notes do SQLite, může se hodit &lt;a href="https://github.com/FujiHaruka/notion-into-sqlite"&gt;notion-into-sqlite&lt;/a&gt; nebo &lt;a href="https://datasette.io/tools/apple-notes-to-sqlite"&gt;apple-notes-to-sqlite&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mvp-katalogu-kurzu"&gt;MVP katalogu kurzů&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#mvp-katalogu-kurzu" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vymyslel jsem si MVP katalogu, na kterém bych chtěl začít co nejdříve pracovat.
Každý krok by mělo být něco, co mohu v rámci &lt;em&gt;continuous deployment&lt;/em&gt; hodit hned na produkci.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Udělám stránku s kurzy, kam se přesune &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/handbook/practice/#kde-hledat-kurzy-a-workshopy"&gt;současný seznam&lt;/a&gt;, a která má svoje tlačítko v menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seznam bude abecedně.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Menu přeteče, takže ho vyladím pro každé rozlišení.
    Možná ho budu muset celé předělat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Informace o kurzech přesunu na samostatné stránky, kde budu mít název, JEDNU VĚTU a upoutávku na klub.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stránky z &lt;code&gt;/topics/&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href="https://junior.guru/topics/engeto/"&gt;příklad&lt;/a&gt;) přesměruju na tyto nové stránky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zvýrazním stránky, které jsou o partnerských firmách.
    Propojím je s &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/#firemni-partnerstvi"&gt;přehledem firemních partnerství&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seznam bude řazen tak, že první budou partneři a potom bude abecedně.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firmy začnu štítkovat a budu generovat stránky pro jednotlivé štítky.
    Díky tomu půjde mezi kurzy nějak filtrovat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doplním postupně další a další data (odkaz, založení firmy, logo…).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vymyslím ceník pro tyto firmy, skoro nic nedám zadarmo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ozvu se hned několika firmám, které mám rozjednané a de facto už jen čekají na to, až bude katalog existovat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vytvořím „návod“ na kurzy do příručky a propojím ho s katalogem.
    Popíšu obecně jejich výhody i úskalí.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus:&lt;/strong&gt; Převedu zbytek &lt;code&gt;/topics/&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href="https://junior.guru/topics/python/"&gt;příklad&lt;/a&gt;) někam do příručky a zabiju starou infrastrukturu, na které tyto stránky běží.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi"&gt;Další&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Propagoval jsem slevu na WebExpo a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN235cq8xP4"&gt;svou Q&amp;amp;A, která bude po Velikonocích&lt;/a&gt;.
    S tou Q&amp;amp;A jsem otapetoval všechny aspoň trochu relevantní skupiny na FB, kde jsem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Z &lt;a href="https://linkedin.zendesk.com/hc/en-us"&gt;LinkedIn API Supportu&lt;/a&gt; jsem dostal rychlé a užitečné odpovědi.
    Bohužel však o tom, že všechna jejich API, která bych chtěl použít, mají jen OAuth 2.0.
    Myslím, že napíšu článek o tom, proč jsou OAuth 2.0 API nejvíc na hovno a nepoužitelná API, která z hloubi duše nenávidím.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Green Fox Academy se rozhodli napsat článek na základě jedné z epizod &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/podcast/"&gt;našeho podcastu&lt;/a&gt;.
    Poslali mi text a já jim to schválil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Existuje internetový tvůrce, kterého sleduji, obdivuji, žeru vše co dělá a čerpám z jeho výtvorů inspiraci pro směřování svého byznysu.
    Má svou vlastní stránku na Wikipedii.
    Teď jsem se oklikou přes kamaráda dověděl, že ví o mé existenci.
    A nejen to!
    Dokonce mi velmi fandí a sleduje, jak se mi daří.
    Tak jsem se s tímto svým internetovým hrdinou hned propojil.
    A on se mi hned ozval a domluvili jsme se na schůzce, že něco vytvoříme spolu.
    Těšte se!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Všiml jsem si &lt;a href="https://obcan.petrbrzek.cz/"&gt;Občan GPT&lt;/a&gt; a přesně něco takového bych chtěl pro klub a junior.guru.
    Je to pecka.
    Bavil jsem se o tom s kamarádem &lt;a href="https://milavotradovec.cz/"&gt;Mílou&lt;/a&gt;, který do toho vidí trochu víc a vymýšleli jsme, co a jak by šlo v tomto směru udělat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tři firmy nejspíš neprodlouží partnerství s junior.guru.
    Jedna kvůli ochlazení na trhu, dvě spíš proto, že jsem změnil ceník a už to pro ně nebude dávat smysl.
    S takovou restrukturalizací jsem při změnách v ceníku počítal, chtěl jsem spíš méně firem za více peněz, než mnoho firem za méně peněz.
    Můj čistý měsíční příjem se mezitím dostal na 54.000 Kč.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Při pátečku jsem si naprogramoval stahování kurzovního lístku z ČNB a udělal jsem si &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/#cisty-zisk"&gt;tady&lt;/a&gt; přepočet toho čistého měsíčního zisku do dolarů a eur.
    Občas si čtu o zahraničních podnikavcích, kteří taky otevřeně sdílí svoje výdělky.
    Mají to však v jiné měně, tak se mi to špatně srovnává.
    Už mě nebavilo to pořád přepočítávat ručně, tak jsem si to naprogramoval.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Věnoval jsem se anketě mezi juniory, kterou připravujeme s ENGETO Academy.
    Připravil jsem poslední kousek, který jsem měl na starost.
    Naplánovali jsme si na dnešek call i s &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/baradrb/"&gt;Bárou&lt;/a&gt; a doladili na něm jak a co bude dál.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nainstaloval jsem si &lt;a href="https://diffusionbee.com/"&gt;DiffusionBee&lt;/a&gt;, ale neměl jsem čas ani náladu si s tím zatím nějak hrát.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přidal jsem &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html"&gt;logování&lt;/a&gt; do souboru.
    Doteď jsem měl na produkci &lt;code&gt;INFO&lt;/code&gt; a lokálně &lt;code&gt;DEBUG&lt;/code&gt;.
    Produkce teď ale šifruje artefakty, tak se tam může &lt;code&gt;DEBUG&lt;/code&gt; ukládat do souboru a třeba mi to jednou pomůže s laděním.
    Lokálně mi zas přišlo, že je těch &lt;code&gt;DEBUG&lt;/code&gt; výpisů už moc, tak jsem je vypnul a pro detaily si buď půjdu do souboru, nebo si level dočasně snížím.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Povedlo se mi &lt;a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/259093/can-touch-id-on-mac-authenticate-sudo-in-terminal"&gt;zapnout TouchID na zadávání &lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt; hesla v terminálu&lt;/a&gt;.
    O dost pohodlnější!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dal jsem nějaké věci do skupiny &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1155320448138033/"&gt;Vše za odnos Žižkov&lt;/a&gt;.
    Většina z domu zmizela v řádu hodin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dnes jsem byl naposled v „podarovaném“ coworkingu.
    Nový jsem zatím nenašel.
    Komunikuji s &lt;a href="https://www.pracovna.cz/"&gt;Pracovnou&lt;/a&gt;, ale na Velikonoce budeme pryč, tak budu pokračovat až se vrátíme do Prahy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zjistil jsem, že můj někdejší velmi oblíbený učitel španělštiny dnes &lt;a href="https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/10435049455-dobre-rano/423236100071027/cast/967934/"&gt;vystupuje v televizi&lt;/a&gt; a dělá všelijaké prospěšné věci kolem vzdělávání dětí.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dostal jsem DIČ.
    Hned jak mu &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/#/vat-validation"&gt;začala platnost&lt;/a&gt;, zadal jsem ho do Simple Analytics, ImprovMX, Memberful, a pro jistotu i na GitHub, kdyby mi poslal fakturu za Copilot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přepsal jsem skript, který zastavuje předchozí buildy na hlavní větvi na CircleCI, aby taky používal &lt;a href="https://github.com/alpinweis/pycircleci"&gt;pycircleci&lt;/a&gt; (viz předchozí poznámky).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;E-maily, &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/club/"&gt;klubový Discord&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://docs.pyvec.org/operations/support.html#sit-kontaktu"&gt;Pyvec Slack&lt;/a&gt;.
    Psal jsem si s doktory, firmami, připomínal jsem lidem jejich úkoly, proplácel jsem nějaká špatně zaplacená členství, přidával mentory, uděloval stipendia.
    Dělal jsem si pořádek v osobních a rodinných financích.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odmítl jsem jednu neplacenou spolupráci, ve které jsem neviděl benefity pro junior.guru.
    Myslel jsem si, že si před tím projdu &lt;a href="https://www.starterstory.com/how-to-say-no"&gt;How to say no&lt;/a&gt; a to mi dodá odvahu, ale nakonec jsem to zvládl i bez toho.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Koupil jsem si nosič na kolo, ale chyběly tam nějaké šrouby a nenamontuju ho.
    Tak ho dneska ponesu zpět do prodejny.
    Nemají skladem další, tak snad nebudu celé jaro čekat na vyřešení.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 8 dní jsem při procházkách nachodil 6 km, ujel na kole 18 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 7 h a zdolal při tom 24 km.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Pokud budu pracovat, mohl bych si pohrát s AI:
    Šlo by použít AI na vítání nových členů v klubu?
    Nebo na analýzu pracovních inzerátů?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Až se vrátím, chtěl bych začít tvořit ten katalog.
Je duben, nejvyšší čas pověnovat se i věcem, které jsem označil za největší priority tohoto roku!&lt;/p&gt;

Super postřeh o tom, jak si politici mohou vytvořit vlastní médium, kde nebudou nikým konfrontováni.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://samkriss.substack.com/p/wokeness-is-not-a-politics"&gt;Wokeness is not a politics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;„The problem is that intellectuals—myself included—are a weird, clammy, undersocialised lot, who spend a lot more time floating around in the bubbly otherworld of ideas than engaging with actual people. What happens if you ask a woke person what wokeness is? They’ll tell you that actually, there’s no such thing as wokeness. It’s not an ideology. It’s not a belief system. It’s just basic decency. It’s just being a good person.
They’re right. Wokeness is an etiquette.“&lt;/li&gt;

What would happen if developers suddenly became 2x more productive? More bugs would be fixed, more features would be shipped, more profit would be made. There's no shortage of stuff to build, and so it's not like we'd run out of work for the devs to do. I actually think that this could increase the total # of developer jobs.“&lt;/li&gt;

Jinak nad AI nezvítězíme&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;„Řada programátorů také propadá panice při poznání, že AI systémy dokážou docela dobře psát kód. Teoreticky jim tak sice zbyde více času na přemýšlení o tom, jaké lidské potřeby má příslušný software naplňovat a jak celou věc dobře komunikovat s uživateli i samotnou umělou inteligencí, ale to je opět věc, ke které jsou potřeba ony nenahraditelné a beletrií vytvářené schopnosti ztotožnění s jinými lidmi a pochopení hlubších zákonitostí jazyka i neverbální komunikace… Pokud to začneme s psaním a čtením literatury faktu příliš přehánět na úkor beletrie a budeme ke knihám přistupovat jen jako ke zdroji rychle a prakticky využitelných informací, nakonec můžeme paradoxně skončit jako lidská obdoba AI systémů.“&lt;/li&gt;

Některé věty přímo rozbrněly moje pozapomenuté PTSD z korporátu. „Does anyone at Google come into work actually thinking about “organizing the world’s information”? They have lost track of who they serve and why. Having worked every day at a startup for eight years, the answer was crystal clear for me — I serve our users. But very few Googlers come into work thinking they serve a customer or user. They usually serve some process or some technology. They serve their manager or their VP. They serve other employees. They will even serve some general Google technical or religious beliefs. This is a closed world where almost everyone is working only for other Googlers, and the feedback loop is based on what your colleagues and managers think of your work. Working extra hard or extra smart doesn’t create any fundamental new value in such a world. In fact, in a bizarre way, it is the opposite.“&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plány:&lt;/strong&gt; Četli jste, co &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/strategie-na-2023/"&gt;letos plánuji&lt;/a&gt;?
Svůj postup zaznamenávám do &lt;a href="https://github.com/orgs/juniorguru/projects/1/"&gt;tabulky na GitHubu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="programovani-nesmyslu"&gt;Programování nesmyslů&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#programovani-nesmyslu" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minule jsem psal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure figure-blockquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pak jsem ještě přepracoval způsob, jakým vypínám a zapínám, zda může bot zapisovat do různých služeb.
Chci totiž, aby se muselo explicitně zapnout, že může zapisovat změny do Discordu nebo do Memberful API.
Na produkci je to vše zapnuté, ale při vývoji mi to brání udělat nevratné chyby ledabylým spouštěním příkazů.
Nebudu to tady rozepisovat, bylo by to dost technické, ale s výsledkem jsem dost spokojen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samozřejmě to nebylo tak jednoduché.
Našel jsem v tom spoustu nedomyšleností a chyb.
Strávil jsem s tím postupně pondělí, úterý, středu…
Poznatky:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Když mám v Pythonu globální proměnnou a pak si přes &lt;code&gt;multiprocessing&lt;/code&gt; udělám proces, tak ten ji nemá.
    Tohle jsem zjistil při debugování, proč mi nic nefunguje a byl to velký heuréka moment, ale radost jsem vlastně moc neměl.
    Data si explicitně předávám mezi procesy a už to nechávám tak, ale zpětně si říkám, zda nakonec nebyly přepínače přes &lt;em&gt;environment variables&lt;/em&gt; víc &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle"&gt;KISS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Povedlo se mi napíchnout do Discord klienta a při vypnutém zapisování do Discordu nechat kód spadnout, pokud se pokusí přes HTTP poslat nějakou metodu, která není &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Idempotent"&gt;idempotentní&lt;/a&gt;.
    Perfektní pojistka!
    Hned mě to upozornilo na několik situací, které jsem neošetřil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asi vám nemusím popisovat, zda mám po tomto týdnu pocit z dobře odvedené práce.
Zamotal jsem se do kódu, seděl nad tím dny a výsledkem je akorát „lepší kód“, místo abych dokončil něco, co má reálně dopad na uživatele.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="anketa"&gt;Anketa&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#anketa" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Z ENGETO Academy přišly poslední dílky ankety, ale já jsem nezvládl dodat svůj poslední dílek.
Zato jsem sepsal vše pro &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/baradrb/"&gt;Báru&lt;/a&gt;, která nám má s anketou pomoci.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mezitím koukám, jak vychází ankety &lt;a href="https://www.czechitas.cz/blog/dvere-do-it-maji-juniori-otevrene-zajem-o-it-je-podle-firem-dulezitejsi-nez-diplom"&gt;všude možně jinde&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/honzajavorek_daedtafx-djangogirls-python-activity-7043536893803667456-bWYS"&gt;Propagoval jsem&lt;/a&gt; úterní přednášku v klubu s &lt;a href="https://www.sedlakovi.org/"&gt;Nasťou Sedlákovou&lt;/a&gt; o tom, jak zvládat kariéru s dětmi za zády.
Přednáška vyšla parádně, opravovali jsme pak akorát trochu zvuk, ale i to zajistil můj pomocník Tinuki.
Ohlasy &lt;a href="https://witter.cz/@banterCZ/110068564967005849"&gt;nadšené&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Nasťa" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid figure-img rounded" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/20230321-44f42c2275ac69c98bd565bff92ffd41b19644079e3cfd8155a76067ef13521d-yt.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Našel jsem kanál &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkRfArvrzheW2E7b6SVT7vQ"&gt;YouTube Creators&lt;/a&gt;, kde vychází novinky pro tvůrce na YouTube.
Přidáno do RSS čtečky.
YouTube se snaží se svými Shorts čelit nástupu TikToku, teď chystají &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feMd_GvZSf4"&gt;velkou ofenzivu na podcasty&lt;/a&gt; (zatím nedostupné v ČR), z čehož asi nemá radost Spotify.
Už teď tam mám přednášky (pro členy), podcast (přes &lt;a href="https://www.headliner.app/"&gt;Headliner&lt;/a&gt;), budou tam moje live Q&amp;amp;A.
Čím dál víc mi dává smysl rozvíjet tam &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/@juniordotguru"&gt;kanál&lt;/a&gt; a publikum, bez ohledu na formáty, kterým se chci do budoucna věnovat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Moje Q&amp;amp;A" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid figure-img rounded" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/20230411-2882f31d997e2dc52be20720fdcb875c5d608d57f4a0c66de27147cd55918894-dc.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyLadies jsem slíbil, že do konce týdne poskytnu informace k chystané Q&amp;amp;A.
Doladil jsem tedy titulek, popisek a plakátek.
Výsledek k vidění přímo na YouTube: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN235cq8xP4"&gt;Honza Javorek: Programování jako kariéra? Ptej se! (Q&amp;amp;A)&lt;/a&gt;
Sdílejte všem, kdo by se mě mohli chtít na něco zeptat 😅&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pracovni-misto"&gt;Pracovní místo&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#pracovni-misto" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S koncem března mi bude končit „podarované“ pracovní místo v Karlínském coworkingu.
Bylo perfektní, že jsem to mohl vyzkoušet a donutilo mě to zkusit přeskládat každodenní režim.
V práci odjinud než z domova bych rád pokračoval, ale ne tam, kam jsem teď chodil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uvažoval jsem o &lt;a href="https://www.pracovna.cz/en/cowork"&gt;Pracovně&lt;/a&gt;, ale Nasťa mi dala tip, že v &lt;a href="https://www.dumradost.cz/cs/pronajem/kancelare"&gt;Radosti nabízí levné kanceláře&lt;/a&gt;, tak to omrknu nejdřív tam.
Poslal jsem jim poptávku.
Pobavilo mě, že „malá zasedačka“ je pro 25 lidí, velká pro 70–100 osob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="spendliky-a-sifrovani"&gt;Špendlíky a šifrování&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#spendliky-a-sifrovani" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když někdo dá v klubu reakci špendlíku k libovolné zprávě, bot mu ji uloží do soukromých zpráv.
Tato funkce je implementovaná příšerně.
V listopadu 2021 jsem si udělal poznámku, že zpracování špendlíků trvá moc dlouho, 2,5min.
A že to mám přepsat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pak mám poznámku z června 2022, že to trvá 6min.
Teď to trvá 7,2min a bot mi kvůli tomu čím dál častěji spadne.
Tak jsem si řekl, že jsem chtěl sice dělat jiné věci, ale tohle už hoří, tak to předělám.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeden z problémů je, že bot neumí efektivně pracovat s historií soukromých konverzací, které vede s členy klubu.
Bylo by snadné zprávy uložit do SQLite, ale jsou to soukromé zprávy a i když jsou mezi botem a uživatelem, členové si nejspíš nemyslí, že když tam něco napíšou, objeví se to pak někde v zipu ke stažení.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jako první jsem tedy přistoupil k tomu, co jsem chtěl stejně udělat už dávno, a to k zašifrování záloh databáze.
Pro jednoduchost jsem zvolil symetrické GPG.
Nechal jsem 1Password vygenerovat silné heslo a napsal jsem si nové příkazy do svého CLI v &lt;a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/"&gt;click&lt;/a&gt;u, které umí zašifrovat zip, odšifrovat, stáhnout z CircleCI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chtěl jsem použít nějakou „novou“ šifru &lt;code&gt;ed25519&lt;/code&gt;, ale nepovedlo se mi to na macOS rozchodit, tak jsem to vzdal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ChatGPT mi pomohlo správně formulovat jednotlivé GPG příkazy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nejdřív jsem chodil na CircleCI API jen tak z &lt;code&gt;requests&lt;/code&gt;, ale čím víc toho bylo, tím to byla větší otrava.
    Použil jsem místo toho &lt;a href="https://github.com/alpinweis/pycircleci/"&gt;pycircleci&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Příkaz na zašifrování a rozšifrování si dokáže heslo přečíst z mého 1Passwordu.
    Není to sice moc přenositelné, ale pro mě velice pohodlné a se svým týmem vývojářů, čítajícím pouze mou osobu, jsme se shodli, že to tak být může.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="ChatGPT a GPG" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid figure-img rounded" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2023-03-24-at-17-58-10.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dane"&gt;Daně&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dane" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Odeslal jsem daně a přehledy za rok 2022.
S datovkou a &lt;a href="https://www.mojeid.cz/"&gt;MojeID&lt;/a&gt; to bylo za 10 minut hotové.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daňař mi poslal dokument k podepsání.
Do PDFka jsem na jeden klik plácl &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/preview/fill-out-and-sign-pdf-forms-prvw35725/mac"&gt;podpis v macOS Preview&lt;/a&gt; a pak jsem to prohnal přes &lt;a href="https://github.com/rwv/lookscanned.io"&gt;lookscanned.io&lt;/a&gt;.
Hotovo!
Od 25.3.2023 jsem &lt;a href="https://www.jakpodnikat.cz/identifikovana-osoba-k-dph.php#anid0"&gt;identifikovanou osobou&lt;/a&gt;, další velký úkol splněn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="doktori"&gt;Doktoři&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#doktori" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zhoršily se mi vrozené potíže s kůží.
Nejdřív jsem to nějak „jako vždycky“ odbýval, ale najednou to nestačilo, tak se to vymklo kontrole.
Pokorně jsem tedy najel na přísný režim, zrušil sporty, nasadil masti.
A jal se najít dermatologa, který by mě po letech přijal do dlouhodobé péče.
Doktora jsem našel.
Na květen 😀
Naštěstí ale režim zafungoval a už to mám zase pod kontrolou.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obvodní lékařka mi neodepisovala na e-mail (prosbu o recept), tak jsem jí zavolal.
Minulý týden měla dovolenou.
Tohle se mi stalo už poněkolikáté, přitom je to vždy u ní na webu v aktualitách.
Napadlo mě, zda nemají RSS.
Mají!
Takže už ve své RSS čtečce odebírám i aktuality své obvoďačky.
Moc jich není, ale o to důležitější bývají.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Aktuality" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid figure-img rounded" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2023-03-24-at-18-00-12.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rozbilo-se-samo"&gt;Rozbilo se samo&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#rozbilo-se-samo" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blbla mi instalace projektu, tak jsem upgradoval na nejnovější &lt;a href="https://python-poetry.org/"&gt;Poetry&lt;/a&gt;.
To způsobilo &lt;a href="https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/7184"&gt;další problémy&lt;/a&gt;.
Tak jsem upgradoval Python z 3.10 na 3.11, na hlavním repozitáři i na realtime botovi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Přestala fungovat normalizace adres u pracovních inzerátů.
Seznam totiž &lt;a href="https://developer.mapy.cz/rest-api/"&gt;přesunul HTTP API Mapy.cz na jiné místo a změnil režim přístupu&lt;/a&gt;.
Psal jsem si s nimi, ale během „beta“ režimu neumí zatím nabídnout menší balíček, než &lt;a href="https://developer.mapy.cz/cena/cenik-premioveho-uziti/"&gt;800 Kč/měs&lt;/a&gt;.
To pro mě nedává vůbec smysl.
Mám prý počkat, až to bude pro veřejnost a sledovat &lt;a href="https://developer.mapy.cz/"&gt;developer.mapy.cz&lt;/a&gt;.
Tak jsem to nějak zatím hacknul a čekám.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="API zmizelo" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2023-03-21-at-14-23-12.png" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V pátek GitHub &lt;a href="https://github.blog/2023-03-23-we-updated-our-rsa-ssh-host-key/"&gt;změnil SSH host klíč&lt;/a&gt; a rozbil tím půl vývojářského internetu.
Musel jsem to opravit lokálně a na CircleCI upgradovat &lt;a href="https://github.com/guitarrapc/git-shallow-clone-orb"&gt;git-shallow-clone-orb&lt;/a&gt;, kde autor naštěstí urychleně vydal novou verzi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi"&gt;Další&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/juniorguru/juniorguru-chick/issues/"&gt;Zaznamenal jsem&lt;/a&gt; pár dalších nápadů pro realtime bota.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dočetl jsem &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52930474-the-middle-ages"&gt;The Middle Ages: A Graphic History&lt;/a&gt;.
    Pěkné to bylo!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experimentuji s &lt;a href="https://getpocket.com/"&gt;Pocketem&lt;/a&gt;.
    Napadlo mě, že bych si tam mohl posílat náhodné články z internetu a pak je přes RSS vytáhnout do své RSS čtečky.
    Bohužel jejich RSS má jen 30 položek (na supportu mi potvrdili, že to je &lt;em&gt;feature&lt;/em&gt; a ne &lt;em&gt;bug&lt;/em&gt;).
    A není tam nic než nadpisy a odkazy.
    Neznáte jiný nástroj, kam jde snadno z počítače i z mobilu posílat odkazy a pak je dostat jako neomezené RSS?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sešel jsem se s kámošem Jožou, probrali jsme spolu drby ze světa práce, plány s junior.guru mentoringem nebo katalogem kurzů, vypili kafe, půjčil mi komixy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navštívila nás babička, tak jsem byl na rande s manželkou.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zavolal jsem si s Iry, které jsem potkal v listopadu díky kamarádům z Afriky, kteří jeli do Prahy na Ubuntu Summit.
    Bavili jsme se o životě a o tom, jak zvládáme podnikání.
    Oni ve dvou lidech dělají &lt;a href="https://zorin.com/"&gt;Zorin OS&lt;/a&gt;.
    Poradili mi, že až budu řešit rozúčtovávání DPH do každé země zvlášť, jako musí oni, může se mi hodit vědět, že existuje &lt;a href="https://www.paddle.com/"&gt;Paddle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Narazil jsem na článek na &lt;a href="https://navolnenoze.cz/novinky/blog/"&gt;blogu portálu Navolnénoze.cz&lt;/a&gt;.
    Ten blog znám, vychází tam dobré věci, ale v RSS čtečce jsem ho neměl.
    Tak si ho jdu přidat a najednou koukám, že &lt;a href="https://navolnenoze.cz/novinky/"&gt;Novinky&lt;/a&gt; jsou úplně přesně to, co jsem v předešlých poznámkách popsal jako svůj „záměr s newslettery“ 😀&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Svůj postup při plnění &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/strategie-na-2023/"&gt;svých plánů&lt;/a&gt; jsem přesunul do &lt;a href="https://github.com/orgs/juniorguru/projects/1/"&gt;tabulky na GitHubu&lt;/a&gt;.
    Když jsem naposledy zkoušel používat GitHub Projects, vůbec to nebylo tak nabušené jako teď!
    Příjemné překvapení, používá se to suprově.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Udělal jsem změny v šabloně pro týdenní poznámky, abych ji co nejvíc zestručnil a změnil jsem úvodní obrázek, aby si lidi všimli, že je něco jinak.
    Poznámky samotné se mi bohužel opět nepovedlo napsat kratší.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;E-maily, &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/club/"&gt;klubový Discord&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://docs.pyvec.org/operations/support.html#sit-kontaktu"&gt;Pyvec Slack&lt;/a&gt;.
    Napsal jsem (konečně) firmám, kterým bude brzy končit partnerství.
    V Python komunitě jsem věnoval hodně času formulování svých myšlenek co se týče účelu a budoucnosti &lt;a href="https://blog.python.cz/"&gt;blog.python.cz&lt;/a&gt;.
    Řešil jsem jeden ztracený login na Discord a dvě stipendia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 8 dní jsem při procházkách nachodil 5 km, na túrách nachodil 6 km, ujel na kole 18 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 7 h a zdolal při tom 29 km.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Vedla k chaosu i nástupu Islámského státu, Ameriku stála důvěryhodnost, říká analytik - VOXPOT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;„…ať už šlo o ten nepravdivý argument zbraněmi hromadného ničení, či o invazi bez souhlasu Rady bezpečnosti OSN, Abú Ghrajb nebo rozpad iráckého státu – to vše poměrně výrazně podlomilo roli, kterou USA měly na začátku 21. století.“&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id="zamer-s-newslettery"&gt;Záměr s newslettery&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#zamer-s-newslettery" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsal jsem si svůj záměr s newslettery, které chystám.
Toto mám k osobnímu newsletteru, který by měl fungovat tady v rámci mého blogu:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Můj osobní newsletter bude lidem posílat seznam odkazů, které teď dávám na Telegram a seznam článků, které jsem vydal na blogu.
    Na konci by byla upoutávka, že mám ještě jeden newsletter, který se týká JG, s ukázkou toho, co dostanou, např. s odkazem na poslední vydání toho JG newsletteru.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ještě nevím, jak vyřeším archiv newsletteru.
    Vydat to jako další článek na blogu mi přijde divné.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na blog přidám štítky, aby přes ně šlo filtrovat a aby je šlo přes RSS separátně odebírat.
    Ono to teda už vlastně jde a štítky tu jsou, ale nikde se nezobrazují.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Předělám blog tak, aby tady všude byly upoutávky na to, že mám newsletter.
    Líbí se mi, jak to dělá Substack nebo jak to má &lt;a href="https://www.pavlinaspeaks.com/"&gt;Pavlína Louženská&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Můj osobní newsletter by se mohl &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a522525"&gt;propisovat jako články na můj LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, pokud API dovolí.
    Lidi by mě mohli pak odebírat i tam.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toto mám k newsletteru/blogu na JG:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na JG vytvořím novou sekci, která bude sdružovat veškerý &lt;em&gt;time-sensitive content&lt;/em&gt;.
    Tedy věci, které nejsou statická příručka, ale vycházejí v čase.
    Moje statusy na LinkedIn, podcasty, články na budoucím blogu JG, newslettery, přednášky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mohlo by se to jmenovat „Log“.
    Líbí se mi, že to vychází z blogu (což vychází z &lt;em&gt;web log&lt;/em&gt;, ehm) a zároveň je slovo &lt;em&gt;log&lt;/em&gt; obecnější a v programátorské hantýrce používané pro protokol o běhu programu.
    Tohle bude protokol o běhu JG 😀&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Časem by se tam daly přidávat další a další události.
    Vítání firem, inzerce práce, založení vlákna v #práce-hledám, upozornění na IRL srazy, svátky aj. akce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Každá taková věc se bude kategorizovat štítkama, podle kterých to půjde filtrovat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na LinkedIn bych mohl psát mnohem častěji a dávat tam „rychlé“ statusy jako dřív na Twitter, které budou upozorňovat na zajímavosti z oboru.
    Mohl bych je třídit pomocí hashtagů.
    Byl by to nějaký flexibilní systém, který by mi umožňoval vymýšlet nové štítky za pochodu.
    Tipy, drby, přednášky, kritika článků v médiích, atd.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log by si ty statusy stáhl k sobě, archivoval by jejich text a publikoval i na webu, hezky roztřízené.
    LinkedIn bych tedy využil jako platformu, kam bych ručně psal novinky, ale zároveň bych měl zálohu a až ta síť shoří v pekle, mohu se přesunout klidně jinam.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jednou za čas se pošle newsletter, který bude inteligentním souhrnem událostí z „Logu“ od posledního newsletteru.
    Vygeneruji to automaticky, ale díky ručně psaným statusům z LinkedInu apod. tam bude prostor pro lidský element.
    V něčem mi také může pomoci ChatGPT API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Newsletter má archiv v rámci „Logu“.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web JG bych pak chtěl prošpikovat (nenásilně) upoutávkami na to, aby se lidi přidali do newsletteru.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Newsletter by se mohl také &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a522525"&gt;propisovat jako články na můj LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, pokud API dovolí.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cílem newsletteru by bylo poskytnout zajímavé informace z oboru, ne dělat vyloženě reklamu na JG.
    Nejspíš tam bude informační koutek o tom, co se děje na JG, ale chci, aby jádrem těch e-mailů byl užitečný obsah, který nikde jinde moc není.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do ceníku přidám, že pracovní nabídky se posílají i do newsletteru.
    Nebude to nejspíš stát nic navíc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pruzkum-openai"&gt;Průzkum OpenAI&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#pruzkum-openai" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Napadlo mě, že bych mohl použít OpenAI tady na blogu.
Nějaká drobnost, díky které bych si ale vyzkoušel jejich API a zjistil, jak to funguje a naučil se s tím.
Tož API je fajn a povedlo se mi z Pythonu posílat na ChatGPT dotazy a dostávat odpovědi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akorát jsem chtěl udělat třeba to, že by ChatGPT vymyslelo shrnutí článku do pár vět pro ty, komu se to nechce celé číst.
A to moc dobře nejde, protože mu mohu poslat jen omezený počet znaků 😀
Zkoušel jsem i nějaký &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/11aoci0/how_to_get_around_the_chatgpt_prompt_size_limit/"&gt;trik z Redditu&lt;/a&gt;, ale bez úspěchu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Budu se tedy ve svých nápadech soustředit zatím jen na věci, které mají zhruba do 2.000 znaků.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pruzkum-ecomailu"&gt;Průzkum Ecomailu&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#pruzkum-ecomailu" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Už před časem jsem si všiml, že existuje &lt;a href="https://www.ecomail.cz/"&gt;Ecomail&lt;/a&gt;, česká služba na mailing, &lt;a href="https://blog.ecomail.cz/ecomail-vs-mailchimp/"&gt;konkurence MailChimpu&lt;/a&gt;.
Šel jsem to konečně prozkoumat a jsem silně nakloněn tomu, že svoje newslettery, které plánuju, rozjedu tam.
Vychází to lépe finančně, budu mít českou podporu a kvalitní doručování do českých schránek a tak dále.
A když jsem zabloudil až k nim na YouTube, našel jsem tam dokonce &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExKnvsENu-U"&gt;video s novinkami&lt;/a&gt;, které zrovna popisuje, jak přidali podporu pro mailing na základě RSS!
V neposlední řadě, API dokumentaci &lt;a href="https://ecomailczv2.docs.apiary.io/"&gt;mají v Apiary&lt;/a&gt;, kde jsem pracoval, takže po &lt;a href="https://fakturoid.docs.apiary.io/"&gt;Fakturoidu&lt;/a&gt; opět moment nostalgie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jediná nevýhoda je, že kontakty z Memberful bych si musel do Ecomailu načíst sám, kdežto s MailChimpem to má integraci.
Memberful má ale API, které jsem už několikrát použil, takže to asi není nic zásadního.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pruzkum-linkedin"&gt;Průzkum LinkedIn&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#pruzkum-linkedin" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn má API a už dřív jsem si tam v nastavení připravil OAuth aplikace, přes které jej mohu použít.
Tak jsem si řekl, že zkusím napsat program, který přes API stáhne odkazy na všechny moje příspěvky na profilu, které jsem na LinkedIn napsal.
Mám totiž pár nápadů, jak by to šlo využít a zároveň bych zjistil, jak se s tím API pracuje.
Možná by to šlo i scrapnout, ale naivně jsem si myslel, že by to přes API mohlo být jednodušší.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="LinkedIn API" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid figure-img rounded" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2023-03-12-at-16-49-09-linkedin-api-documentation-linkedin.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dokumentace API je ale složitá a je to spousta klikání a čtení, tak jsem to vzdal a zkusil ChatGPT.
Zeptal jsem se nejdřív toto:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure figure-blockquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a profile at LinkedIn and I add posts there so that others can read them. They are public. How do I use the LinkedIn API to list my own posts using Python 3?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hned mi vyhodil kód, který šel prakticky &lt;em&gt;copy-paste&lt;/em&gt; použít.
Jenže to bylo mnou nenáviděné OAuth 2.0, které nejde použít bez interakce s uživatelem (se mnou), tzn. pro účely nějaké automatizace na JG je to nepoužitelné.
Zkusil jsem tedy doplňující dotaz:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure figure-blockquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there a way to do this without user interaction? This requires me to open a browser and do something as a human. I'd like to have a Python 3 script, which runs on a server, without human interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A šup, měl jsem krásný příklad, jak to udělat jinak.
Ten bohužel nefunguje, ale za to ChatGPT nemůže:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'error'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'access_denied'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'error_description'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'This application is not allowed to create application tokens'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tak jsem zkoušel a hledal, kde bych to nějak vyřešil, ale bez šance.
&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/authentication/client-credentials-flow?context=linkedin%2Fcontext"&gt;Dokumentace praví&lt;/a&gt;, že mám „Reach out to the LinkedIn Relationship Manager or Business Development team to get the necessary access“, což netuším co znamená.
Napsal jsem jim na support (&lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/honzajavorek/9f9db686888715ee09ce877cccb70feb"&gt;zhruba 4.000 znaků textu&lt;/a&gt;, ehm) a k mému překvapení do několika hodin odpověděli.
Akorát že tohle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure figure-blockquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of your questions, we have dedicated resources for APIs that you can find here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally any specific questions you have regarding your app can be directed to our API helpdesk: https://linkedin.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pokračování někdy příště.
Koukal jsem ještě na GitHub, jestli už někdo něco s LinkedIn API neřešil, ale je tam hlavně hromada pokusů o scrapování LinkedIn.
Nejhustější je projekt &lt;a href="https://github.com/tomquirk/linkedin-api"&gt;linkedin-api&lt;/a&gt;, který zřejmě používá hodně lidí a má i sponzory, ale přímo v README má tohle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure figure-blockquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project violates Linkedin's User Agreement Section 8.2, and because of this, Linkedin may (and will) temporarily or permanently ban your account. We are not responsible for your account being banned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jako nevím, no.
Ještě to oficiální API nebudu vzdávat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="priprava-qa"&gt;Příprava Q&amp;amp;A&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#priprava-qa" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dotáhl jsem tento týden výběr termínu Q&amp;amp;A.
Bude 11.4. v šest večer, &lt;a href="https://youtube.com/live/vN235cq8xP4"&gt;tady na YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.
Posouval jsem to několikrát.
Snažil jsem se domluvit s PyLadies, aby to bylo i pro ně a nebylo to v den, kdy mají večer kurz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bude to fungovat tak, že se připojím na Discord, tam mě Tinuki nahraje a odstreamuje to na YouTube.
Na Discordu i na YouTube je chat.
Členové se mohou ptát na Discordu, ostatní na YouTube na chatu.
Budu se to snažit sledovat a na vše postupně odpovídat.
V záznamu budou oba chaty, protože jeden bude přímo ve snímaném obrazu, druhý uchovává YouTube spolu s videem a při přehrávání záznamu se budou komentáře postupně objevovat, jako by to bylo v reálném čase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jsem zvědav, jaké to bude a jak to zvládneme technicky.
Zatím to budu šířit jen v klubu a mezi PyLadies.
Napodzim udělám další Q&amp;amp;A a o té už dám vědět třeba i do dalších komunit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spolu s tímhle jsem doladil i termín jedné z budoucích přednášek v klubu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mentoring"&gt;Mentoring&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#mentoring" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Udělal jsem si pořádek v mentorech z Mews, kde mi nějak neseděly počty a měl jsem pocit, že mi někdo chybí v seznamu, a přitom se nabízel na mentoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Svůj záměr s mentoringem, který jsem popsal v minulých poznámkách, jsem poslal mentorům v klubu a požádal je o zpětnou vazbu.
Zároveň jsem se konečně po třičtvrtě roce dokopal k tomu, abych zpracoval poznámky z někdejšího callu s Linhem, nejaktivnějším mentorem v klubu, a nasdílel je s ostatními mentory, aby se mohli vyjádřit.
Linh pojmenovával mnoho různých bolestí současného fungování mentoringu a mě zajímá, jestli to vidí stejně, nebo zda vidí třeba i nějaké další věci, které by bylo dobré řešit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V mentoringovém programu v klubu je 23 lidí, ale vyjádřili se k tomu zhruba 3, takže zatím jsem moc zpětné vazby neposbíral.
Vypadá to ale, že případné změny by snad mohly jít dobrým směrem.
Minimálně by nejspíš řešily většinu problémů, které identifikoval Linh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="anketa"&gt;Anketa&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#anketa" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opět jsme si volali s ENGETO Academy ohledně ankety.
Jsme v podstatě ve finále.
Máme posledních pár drobností, co chceme doladit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sehnal jsem ještě kamarádku &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/baradrb/"&gt;Báru&lt;/a&gt;, která rozumí anketám a podívá se na to, než to pustíme do světa.
Taky to pak chceme ještě na zkoušku projít třeba s třemi lidmi a pozorovat je, jak to vyplní.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pyvo"&gt;Pyvo&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#pyvo" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ve středu bylo v Praze &lt;a href="https://pyvo.cz/praha-pyvo/"&gt;Pyvo, sraz programátorů v Pythonu&lt;/a&gt;.
Už strašně dlouho jsem tam nebyl, tak jsem vyrazil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Před srazem jsem se ještě na pivu sešel s Tatankou, členem klubu, a pár kamarády.
Pak jsme šli na Pyvo a tam jsem si povídal s mnoha lidmi o všem možném, od komunity a konferencí až po ADHD a autismus.
Potkal jsem se tam i s již zmíněnou Bárou a řešili jsme i tu anketu.
Rozdal jsem pár JG samolepek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="podcast"&gt;Podcast&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#podcast" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green Fox Academy si na JG zaplatili nejvyšší tarif a v rámci něj je epizoda podcastu.
Domluvili jsme kdo bude hostem a Pája to natočila.
Povedlo se nám najít hosta, který má dokonce vztah i k JG klubu, takže super.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Výrobu podcastu ale provázela určitá nejistota, protože to byl první takový placený díl a navíc jde o vzdělávací agenturu.
Já si přitom hodně &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/faq/#vzdelavaci-agentury"&gt;hlídám střet zájmů&lt;/a&gt;.
Pavlína mi před vydáním poslala sestříhaný draft a ten jsem si poslechl.
Líbilo se mi to a nepřišlo mi, že by to po obsahové stránce vyžadovalo nějaké změny nebo opatrnější našlapování.
Lukáš je v podcastu skvělý a vysvětluje jak věci kolem GFA, tak poskytuje i obecnější rady pro ty, kdo se chystají změnit kariéru.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chci však, aby takové díly byly transparentně označeny.
Tento týden jsem na tom pracoval, právě proto, že měla vyjít tato epizoda.
Myslel jsem, že při tom předělám i obrázky pro epizody a upoutávky, ale na to nakonec nedošlo, protože jsem se zamotal v refactoringu všeho možného.
Epizody vytvořené ve spolupráci s firmou jsem označil na webu, na Discordu, v popisku v XML feedu podcastu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Označený podcast" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid figure-img rounded" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2023-03-17-at-23-52-08.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na webu jsem přemístil tlačítko vedoucí na YouTube, aby bylo první.
Uvědomil jsem si, že pokud si lidi vybírají, tak preferuji, aby lidi sledovali můj YouTube účet, než aby šli na Spotify, protože na YouTube toho dávám a budu dávat víc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Preference YouTube" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid figure-img rounded" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2023-03-17-at-23-54-31.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když už jsem upravoval oznamovačku podcastu v klubu, tak jsem ji změnil celou a vylepšil.
Jsou tam teď taky tlačítka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Podcast na Discordu" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2023-03-17-at-23-55-30.png" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeden kamarád, kterého nebudu jmenovat, si opakovaně stěžuje na zvukovou kvalitu podcastu.
Vedl jsem o tom s ním debaty a potom i s Pájou.
Stojím si za tím, že priority jsou takové, jaké jsme si s Pavlínou nastavili na začátku:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Podcast existuje a Páju baví.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kvalita obsahu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kvalita zpracování.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Podcast jsme založili jako &lt;em&gt;low-effort&lt;/em&gt; projekt, který musí být možné stíhat rodičovské.
Máme svoje limity.
Když budeme tlačit na kvalitu zvuku, bude to větší závazek a Pavlínu to bude méně bavit.
Navíc ani já, ani Pavlína nejsme audiofilové a současná kvalita nám stačí.
Jasně, občas se stane nějaká chyba, která nás mrzí, ale jinak si myslíme, že to není potřeba moc řešit.
Za nás je to &lt;em&gt;good enough&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poslal jsem e-mail do GFA, že podcast je hotov.
Reakce byla:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure figure-blockquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skvělé! Moc děkuju, mám z toho radost!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;li&gt;V klubu jsem obnovil kanály #python, #csharp a #php.
    Přidal jsem kanál #java.
    K tomu jsem překopal &lt;em&gt;onboarding&lt;/em&gt; na Discordu, kde si lidi vybírají oblasti zájmu.
    Nově jsou tam i přímo takhle jazyky a lidé dostanou i role, např. „Zajímá mě: Python“.
    Tyto role jdou rovnou v chatu označit a poslat tím notifikaci.
    „Tajnou“ skupinku Django Coders jsem potom přesvědčil, že už existuje dost vhodnějších míst, kde mohou realizovat totéž, a po domluvě jsme kanál archivovali.
    Měl jsem spoustu nápadů, jak bude bot na Discordu hlídat, že každý kanál pro daný jazyk má svou roli a že popisky jsou všude stejné apod., ale nakonec jsem si zabránil to hned začít programovat a udělal jsem vše jen ručně.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/Ee8sV6MrPN"&gt;Discordu Jakuba Zelenky&lt;/a&gt; „Mimo Agendu“ jsem napsal &lt;a href="https://discord.com/channels/809699708557721610/812644125953359882/1085303527993245736"&gt;něco jako inzerát na novináře&lt;/a&gt;, kterého bych najmul, ale zatím spíš bez odezvy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Koupili jsme letenky na dovolenou.
    Zjistil jsem, že na &lt;a href="http://festivalopsani.cz/"&gt;Festival o psaní&lt;/a&gt; nebudu v Praze a přemýšlím, co s lístkem.
    Napsal jsem jim e-mail, ale zatím bez odpovědi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přepsal jsem kód, který mi vyrábí obrázky pomocí screenshotů, aby pokaždé nespouštěl prohlížeč.
    Hypotéza byla, že se to tím hrozně zdržuje.
    Vytáhl jsem to tedy do separátního procesu, který běží na pozadí a když dostane úkol něco screenshotovat, tak to udělá a pošle výsledek.
    Zabralo mi to jedno celé dopoledne a bohužel to nic zásadně nezrychlilo 😂
    Zrušil jsem aspoň vytváření upoutávky na přednášku pro Instagram a pro web.
    Vytváří se jen pro YouTube a pro Discord.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vyřídil jsem dvě stipendia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opravil jsem Jobs.cz scraper, aby správně stahoval loga firem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Povedlo se mi upravit &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/isublime"&gt;iSublime&lt;/a&gt; tak, že si umí načíst heslo k iCloudu z mého 1Passwordu.
    Nechtěl jsem ho mít jen tak hozené do &lt;em&gt;environment variable&lt;/em&gt;.
    Teď když to spustím, vyskočí na mě akorát že mám přiložit palec ke čtečce otisků prstů na mém Macbooku a když ho přiložím, program se přihlásí a synchronizuje soubory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prokrastinoval jsem maily firmám, které mají končit v březnu, a bylo mi trapné, abych se jim ozýval dva týdny před koncem partnerství.
    Jednu firmu jsem rovnou vyřídil a poslal fakturu na další období, protože jsme byli domluvení z osobní schůzky.
    Povedlo se mi při tom udělat chybu a způsobil jsem, že firma zmizela na pár dní z webu.
    Trochu &lt;em&gt;faux pas&lt;/em&gt;, ale snad nic hrozného.
    Chyba to nebyla vyloženě lidská, spíš to byla nedostatečně otestovaná situace v kódu, takže jsem doplnil testy a opravil to.
    Spolu s tím jsem opravil i pár dalších drobností v evidenci firem.
    Ostatním jsem prodloužil partnerství do dubna a pokusím se jim co nejdřív ozvat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chtěl jsem dnes předělat vítání nových členů v klubu, ale když jsem se podíval do kódu, nějak jsem se neubránil a začal přepisovat pár věcí.
    Soubor &lt;code&gt;club.py&lt;/code&gt; jsem rozdělil asi na pět menších.
    Na různé konstanty jsem použil &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html"&gt;Enum&lt;/a&gt;.
    Pak jsem ještě přepracoval způsob, jakým vypínám a zapínám, zda může bot zapisovat do různých služeb.
    Chci totiž, aby se muselo explicitně zapnout, že může zapisovat změny do Discordu nebo do Memberful API.
    Na produkci je to vše zapnuté, ale při vývoji mi to brání udělat nevratné chyby ledabylým spouštěním příkazů.
    Nebudu to tady rozepisovat, bylo by to dost technické, ale s výsledkem jsem dost spokojen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Řešil jsem nějaké problémy s účty u členů klubu, změny v předplatných, vracení peněz.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doklepli jsme s daňařem přiznání, akorát ty věci musím ještě nahrát na příslušné portály.
    Pokročili jsme v tom, abych se stal idenfitikovanou osobou.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přišla mi pozvánka na vyzkoušení Bingu s AI, ale pak to po mě chtělo, abych si stáhl Edge nebo co, tak jsem to zavřel a neřešil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jordi Bruin vydal &lt;a href="https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/?recommended_by=library"&gt;novou verzi MacGPT a další aplikace&lt;/a&gt;, která už umí i to jejich nové API, ale nakonec stejně chodím spíš k nim na web.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na realtime botovi jsem do &lt;a href="https://github.com/juniorguru/juniorguru-chick/issues"&gt;Issues&lt;/a&gt; nasypal nápady na půl roku dopředu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prošel jsem svá trička a vyházel stará.
    Koupil jsem si pak nová trička.
    Různě na internetu a v infocentru Prahy 3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Byl jsem pro něco do Alzy a když jsem šel na zastávku tramvaje, uviděl jsem, že zrovna jedna jede.
    Rozběhl jsem se a pak si jen pamatuju, že jsem hodně zblízka viděl chodník.
    Tramvaj jsem stihl.
    Na přestupu mě trochu ošetřil pán v kebabu.
    Je to týden, tak se už díry v rukou hojí, ale první dny byly celkem blbé.
    Zničil jsem si gatě, ale jinak žádné větší škody.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Byli jsme s děckem v kavárně v &lt;a href="https://www.dox.cz/"&gt;DOX&lt;/a&gt;u a je tam super herna pro děti.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teploty se dnes vyšplhaly na 15°C, takže jsem vzal děcko podruhé na kolo a objel s ním celkem slušný kus Prahy kolem Rokytky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odpovídání v klubu, e-maily, &lt;a href="https://docs.pyvec.org/operations/support.html#sit-kontaktu"&gt;Pyvec Slack&lt;/a&gt;, atd.
    Upgradování závislostí na vlastních i Pyvec projektech (zpracovávání Pull Requestů, které průběžně posílá Dependabot).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 8 dní od 10. 3. do 17. 3. jsem při procházkách nachodil 10 km, ujel na kole 18 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 8 hodin a zdolal při tom 28 kilometrů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finanční výsledky, návštěvnost a další čísla k JG &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;mám přímo na webu&lt;/a&gt;.
    Aktuální nabídky práce pro juniory: &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/dbbb7bf406b3c33aeba36cae817919d44bfb368a08fb1b4899dba130/"&gt;Processand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/aac817ee027512f150caf872e149e12ef9246815b1ecf880501b877d/"&gt;Red Hat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Udělal jsem něco z &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/strategie-na-2023/"&gt;plánů na rok 2023&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;„Začneme označovat epizody, které jsou finančně podpořené spoluprací s firmami“ je hotovo!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;„Rozjedu pravidelné Q&amp;amp;A pro komunity“ skoro hotovo!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;„Pohraju si s AI“ je hotovo!
    Jako lepší by bylo, kdybych s tím něco i vytvořil, ale asi si to odškrtnu už teď.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přemýšlím nad „umožním lidem odebírat tento blog a novinky na junior.guru skrze newsletter“.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Makám na „stanu se identifikovanou osobou“.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Makám na „budu se podílet na anketě mezi juniory“.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Makám na „dvakrát do roka si dám dovolenou, která bude aspoň týden v kuse“.&lt;/li&gt;

Nenávidím ho. Každý odkaz se otevře jinak, každý musím zpracovat jinak, pokud jej chci dostat do standardního Safari, nemluvě např. o Firefoxu. Každá aplikace to má jinak a neexistuje globální nastavení, které by in-app browser třeba zakázalo a vše by se muselo otevřít přímo v Safari (nebo v příslušné appce, pokud to umí).&lt;/li&gt;

You will almost never lose money, followers, attention, or reach simply from posting too much… No one wants to pick “quantity” over “quality” when it comes to their own work, and most readers, given the explicit choice, would say they prefer one great newsletter a week over five “coherent” ones. But the fact is that as much as people might complain that a given newsletter appears too frequently for them to read it, or that a person's byline is ubiquitous, in practice, the vast majority will not unsubscribe or mute or ignore.“&lt;/li&gt;

Rychle na vás někdo nastoupí a pokusí se vás „zaměstnat“. Paradoxní je, že kdybyste místo přemýšlení bezmyšlenkovitě vyřizovali desítky nebo stovky e-mailů, svět kolem vás bude spokojený… zaneprázdněnost je intelektuálním ekvivalentem fast foodu a pro kreativní práci má zhruba stejnou výživovou hodnotu.“&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://aella.substack.com/p/the-identity-of-tits"&gt;The Identity of Tits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Opět Aella. Zajímavá úvaha nad tím, jak atraktivita nebo to, že je někdo „sexy“ a chová se „sexy“ sice zvyšuje pozornost ostatních, ale zároveň způsobuje to, že ostatní danou osobu přestanou respektovat a neberou ji vážně. Proč to tak je? „Often when people ask why I’m popular, others respond, “tits.” And maybe this is partially true, but it immediately kicks the legs out from under the serious stuff I’ve done, frames me as someone who people only are pretending to respect… I probably would have way fewer followers if not tits. But maybe I would have more respect if not tits? It also threatens the reputations of those who do respect me, because now they’re vulnerable to being accused as manipulated by or secretly just into tits… I like the idea of seeing if I can get people to take me seriously while presenting as someone people should not take seriously.“&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Před týdnem jsem poznámky nestihl, protože jsme odjeli do Brna na prodloužený víkend a ve vlaku se mi chtělo spíš programovat.
Takže píšu zpětně za dva týdny.
Může se to zdát dlouhé, ale standardně jsou poznámky na 10 minut čtení a tohle je na 20, takže to vychází 😀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vitani-firem"&gt;Vítání firem&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#vitani-firem" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Po dokončení evidence firem jsem se vrhnul na úpravy vítání firem v klubu.
Vždy, když uzavřu partnerství s novou firmou, uvítá ji bot viditelně v klubu a popíše, co jsme si domluvili.
Původní verze byla vzhledem k nové evidenci firem už zastaralá, takže jsem to celé přepisoval.
Nejvíc práce dalo vymyslet nové uvítání tak, aby bylo co nejpřehlednější.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Vítačka" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2023-03-10-at-14-43-40.png" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vylepsovani-nabidek-prace"&gt;Vylepšování nabídek práce&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#vylepsovani-nabidek-prace" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V bodech jsem si sepsal záměr, jaký mám s nabídkami práce do budoucna:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inzeráty jsou jednak inzeráty, jednak data, která mohu podarovat (Czechitas, Aj Ty v IT) nebo prodat dál.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Propisují se do klubu v podobě fóra, do kterého přispívá bot, ale může tam přispět i někdo jiný.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kariérní věci se probírají v #kariéra nebo #pohovory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Existuje #práce-inzeráty (kam padají inzeráty), #práce-hledám (kam píšou lidi).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Náhled na inzeráty je na webu, ale víc informací k nabídkám práce se lidi doví v klubu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Informace k nabídkám lze donekonečna vylepšovat zlepšováním dat, což přináší hodnotu klubu i datům.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data zatím nebudu sbírat do historie a nebudu se tím trápit…
    Na GitHubu nebo na CDN bych možná mohl mít data warehouse, ale pokud by odběratelům stačila průtoková data, je to pro mě jednodušší.
    Zase bez historie nejsem schopen sám data nějak analyzovat a dělat k firmám např. graf jak často hledají juniory apod.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Algoritmus třídění nabídek zjednoduším.
    Najít 20 % práce, která vyřeší 80 % věcí.
    Analyzovat složitě texty inzerátů je asi overkill, nejspíš by šlo dosáhnout podobného výsledku s pár klíčovými slovy a dobře mířenými reguláry.
    Netrápit se tolik tím, pokud proklouzne seniornější nabídka nebo občas něco nerelevantního, ale spíš tím, že nespravědlivě vyhážu 30 juniorních.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implementace AI je bonus a pokud by se mi povedlo udělat nový algoritmus dostatečně dobrý, možná to dělat vůbec nebudu.
    Pokud AI bude, tak v klubu bude ještě forum #práce-inzeráty-koš (výchozí emoji bude 👍) a dobrovolná role, kterou si mohou vzít lidi, kteří chtějí s nabídkami práce pomáhat.
    Mohou se probírat košem a učit AI, že něco neměla vyhodit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bylo by dobré zefektivnit stahování inzerátů, aby to odsýpalo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bylo by dobré si ke scraperům vytvořit monitoring a dát třeba na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;/open/&lt;/a&gt; nějaké statistiky, ať vím, co se ve skutečnosti děje.
    Při posledním předělávání inzerátů jsem monitoring smazal a doteď jej ničím nenahradil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nový vzhled pracovních inzerátů v klubu jsem tedy udělal pomocí Discord kanálu typu fórum.
Krátkým skriptem jsem ověřil, že lze do vláken ve fórech přidávat embedy, tlačítka, apod.
Náhledový obrázek mi ale přidat nešlo.
&lt;a href="https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord/discussions/1948"&gt;Zeptal jsem se&lt;/a&gt; a pak jsem si sám odpověděl, protože jsem našel &lt;em&gt;workaround&lt;/em&gt;.
Nicméně jde o bug a autoři pycordu jej už opravují.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Následně jsem překopal kanály, které řeší pracovní inzeráty.
Měl jsem v klubu #práce a #práce-bot.
Nyní je tam #práce-inzeráty, kam přispívá jak bot, tak lidi, a #práce-hledám, kde mohou lidé práci poptávat.
Bota jsem naučil zakládat v #práce-inzeráty vlákno pro každou nabídku zvlášť, s logem a tlačítky, a hned jsem to pustil na produkci.
První reakce od členů v klubu nebyly jednoznačné, ale budu doufat, že je to lepší, než co tam bylo předtím.
Těžko členům teď vysvětlovat, že jde o úplně prvotní verzi a výhody nového uspořádání vyniknou až s dalšími změnami a vylepšeními.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Inzeráty" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2023-03-10-at-17-10-28.png" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Například mohu ke každému inzerátu přidat do vlákna zprávu s dalšími informacemi o firmě.
Mohu každou nabídku obohatit dalšími odkazy, daty, grafy.
Lidé mohou pod inzeráty diskutovat.
Je to na Discordu, takže tam mohu mít i věci, které bych veřejně na web raději nedával.
Zároveň je to přidaná hodnota pro členy klubu a další důvod platit za klub, což mi pomáhá tuhle práci financovat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Následně jsem skoro celý jeden pracovní den strávil s tím, že jsem procházel svoje historické poznámky a úkoly k pracovním inzerátům na JG.
Byl to jeden dlouhý sloupec v Trellu, který jsem roztřídil na tři jiné:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vylepšování &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/"&gt;webové verze inzerátů&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vylepšování dat kolem inzerátů (např. normalizace názvu firmy, deduplikace…),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nové zdroje inzerátů, ze kterých by je šlo stahovat (asi 30 nápadů).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Několika kartičkám jsem se samozřejmě pouze zasmál a smazal je.
Některé staré nápady byly fakt naivní.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pak jsem udělal &lt;em&gt;proof of concept&lt;/em&gt; na scraper Jobs.cz.
Ten jsem postupně vylepšoval a vylepšoval.
Zatím to neumí inzeráty, které jsou na samostatných klientských portálech, ale základní inzeráty to zvládne.
Poslední vylepšení jsem dělal během dneška, tak uvidím, jak to bude fungovat a co bude potřeba opravit.
Až to chvíli pojede, napíšu do Czechitas, že už si Jobs.cz nemusí stahovat samy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="XPath" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2023-03-07-at-18-41-19.png" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figure-caption"&gt;
Překvapilo mě, jak pěkně umí ChatGPT napovídat se složitými XPath dotazy. Odpověď na toto bych na Google hledal hodinu, tady jsem vložil konkrétní HTML a přirozeným jazykem AI nasměroval k tomu, co potřebuji vyřešit.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nějvětší paráda je, jak se mi to celé daří dělat v rámci &lt;em&gt;continuous deployment&lt;/em&gt;.
V podstatě každý commit šel hned na produkci a mohl jsem se tak průběžně vždy radovat z hotové práce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="realtime-bot"&gt;Realtime bot!&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#realtime-bot" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI &lt;a href="https://openai.com/blog/introducing-chatgpt-and-whisper-apis"&gt;vydalo API&lt;/a&gt; a to mě zase nakoplo, abych si pospíšil s realtime botem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jde o to, že můj standardní bot se spouští jen zhruba jednou denně.
Už delší dobu jsem měl nápad, že by mohl existoval ještě realtime bot, který by pomáhal s nenáročnými drobnostmi, jmenovitě:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Okamžité zakládání vláken v některých kanálech,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;okamžité vítání nových členů,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;okamžité ukládání špendlíků do soukromých zpráv,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a další.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bot by vycházel pouze ze stavu Discordu, neměl by žádnou databázi nebo napojení na zbytek JG.
Kdyby spadnul, nic zásadního by se nestalo, asynchronní pomalý bot by to pak někdy udělal za něj.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No a já si brousím zuby na to, že by tihle moji boti mohli lidi vítat s pomocí ChatGPT.
Je to příležitost, jak být mezi prvními, kdo se naučí využívat ChatGPT v praxi, ve svém produktu, a získat tak v téhle zásadní oblasti náskok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nemám na to ale vlastně moc čas.
Naštěstí jsem objevil pomocníka jménem &lt;a href="https://github.com/Mandlemankiller"&gt;Mandlemankiller&lt;/a&gt;, který se do tvorby realtime bota s nadšením pustil.
Pro něj je to pěkný projekt, na kterém se může učit, a mě to řeší reálné potřeby a reálné &lt;em&gt;R&amp;amp;D&lt;/em&gt;.
Organizaci na GitHubu jsem vytvořil už minule, teď jsem přidal &lt;a href="https://github.com/juniorguru/juniorguru-chick/"&gt;repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nejvíc času nám zabralo vymyslet název.
Nakonec jsem vymýšlení vzdal a nazval to &lt;code&gt;juniorguru-chick&lt;/code&gt; (bot se jmenuje kuře), ačkoliv to z různých důvodů není úplně ideální, ale chtěl jsem se po hodině vymýšlení posunout už někam dál.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Nové repo" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid figure-img rounded" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2023-03-10-at-17-11-55-issues-juniorguru-juniorguru-chick.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zatím bot umí okamžité zakládání vláken ve dvou kanálech, kde se to v klubu hodí.
Vítání uděláme v první verzi bez AI, ale i tam nám to ještě zabere nějaký čas, protože tam to bude chtít promyslet a bude to víc práce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mandlemankillerovo nadšení do práce mě strhlo a snažil jsem se, aby se na věci co nejvíc učil, aby měl nové výzvy, a abych jej nezadusil tím, že nebudu po ruce.
Bylo vlastně osvěžující po letech práce v jednom člověku zase jednou sepisovat README a dělat věci jako Issues, reviews, nebo Pull Requesty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chtěl jsem, aby to celé bylo &lt;em&gt;continuous deployment&lt;/em&gt; a aby hned viděl výsledky své práce.
Jako runtime jsem zvolil &lt;a href="https://fly.io/"&gt;Fly.io&lt;/a&gt;, kde už jednu soukromou appku mám a zdá se mi to tam v pohodě.
Inspiroval jsem se &lt;a href="https://jonahlawrence.hashnode.dev/hosting-a-python-discord-bot-for-free-with-flyio"&gt;tady&lt;/a&gt;, ale nakonec jsem řešil hned několik zádrhelů.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fly neumí v Python buildpacku instalovat pomocí &lt;a href="https://python-poetry.org/"&gt;Poetry&lt;/a&gt; a řešení je vlastní &lt;code&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/code&gt;.
Jenže ten zas neumím já.
Nefungoval mi deploy a než jsem přišel na to, čím to je, myslel jsem, že mám chybu v &lt;code&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/code&gt; a skoro jsem už i nainstaloval Docker a smiřoval se s tím, že se jej budu muset konečně naučit.
Bylo to ale tím, že se mi &lt;code&gt;flyctl&lt;/code&gt; lokálně zneschopnilo kvůli nějakému problému se sítí (&lt;em&gt;wireguard&lt;/em&gt;, který &lt;a href="https://community.fly.io/t/deployments-not-working-error-connecting-to-docker/3992/40"&gt;mám resetovat&lt;/a&gt;, ehm, vůbec netuším o co jde).
Řešil jsem to snad hodinu nebo dvě.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Další problém byl, že bot nemá žádný interface, na kterém by mohlo Fly kontrolovat, jestli žije.
Trvalo dost dlouho, než mi došlo, že deploy neprojde, protože se Fly snaží zjistit, zda bot jede, ale nemá jak.
Smazal jsem tedy kontroly, které mi Fly vygenerovalo do konfiguráku a už to jelo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Později jsem se naučil, jak k realtime Discord botovi &lt;a href="https://github.com/juniorguru/juniorguru-chick/issues/1"&gt;přidat i nějakou HTTP stránku přes aiohttp&lt;/a&gt;.
Tohle jsem nikdy nedělal, takže pomohlo &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/54462411/325365"&gt;StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt; a dokumentace.
Nakonec se mi &lt;a href="https://github.com/juniorguru/juniorguru-chick/pull/9/"&gt;podařilo&lt;/a&gt; vystavit jednoduchou JSON odpověď, přes kterou mohu kontrolovat, že bot žije.
Dělám to jak přes Fly, kam jsem vrátil kontroly, tak přes &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/junior.guru/blob/e570f9bcf1b7fdf2216ce113d1337b1168ca2f4c/juniorguru/cli/check_bot.py"&gt;nový skript&lt;/a&gt; na hlavním repu.
Ten se podívá, jestli bot žije a pokud ne, tak build selže.
Neshodí to ale celý build.
Podobně jako kontrola rozbitých odkazů v příručce mi tohle jen zahlásí do e-mailu, že se něco nepovedlo, ale nezávisí na tom vše ostatní.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vypisuje se tam i &lt;em&gt;uptime&lt;/em&gt; a hned při prvním pokusu mi přišlo, že je nějaký malý.
V logu na Fly jsem pak zjistil, že se bot nemohl připojit v jednu chvíli na Discord, tak spadl, ale Fly jej nahodilo zpět.
Takže paráda!
Máme realtime bota, který už s něčím pomáhá v klubu a máme na něj i primitivní monitoring, který jednou denně zkontroluje, jestli bot žije.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mentoring"&gt;Mentoring&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#mentoring" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sešel jsem se s Mews a s Pure Storage.
V Mews mají super střechu s výhledem a v Pure Storage spoustu balkónů, kde mohou lidi pracovat, jíst, nebo prostě chillovat a dýchat u toho čerstvý vzduch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obě schůzky byly v podstatě debriefingem k aktuální podobě firemního partnerství.
V mnohém to bylo podobné, protože obě firmy se mnou spolupracují na 1:1 mentoringu v klubu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na základě zpětné vazby mi dává smysl do budoucna změnit, jak mentoring funguje.
Nyní se junioři s mentory domlouvají napřímo a nemám nad tím prakticky žádnou kontrolu, žádný vhled.
Nemohu se tím pádem starat o kvalitu a životní štěstí ani jedné ze stran.
Nejsou jasná očekávání a i pokud jsou někde napsaná, lidé je ne vždy respektují, nebo si je uvědomují.
Individuální mentoring poskytovaný dobrovolníky je možná až příliš dobrá nabídka na to, že to je dostupné všem v základní sazbě za klub a u juniorů to přispívá k tomu, že si této nabídky někdy dostatečně neváží.
Junioři přicházejí s jednorázovými problémy či úkoly, jsou na schůzky nepřipravení, nebo vůbec netuší, co od toho celého chtít.
Mentoři netuší, zda mohou někoho odmítnout a jak, někdo nemá dostatečně silné osobní hranice a souhlasí pak se vším, ale je mu z toho následně smutno.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Řešení, které mě zatím napadá, je zavést přihlašovací formulář, podobně jako u stipendia.
Junior do několika políček popíše, jaké jsou její nebo jeho cíle, co potřebuje řešit, atd.
Fakt, že bude potřeba vyplnit formulář, odradí lidi, kteří do toho nechtějí vložit žádnou energii.
Formulář také přinutí člověka zodpovědět si položené otázky i sám pro sebe, ujasnit si myšlenky, cíle, motivaci.
Celé to bude působit víc dojmem „jdu se tady přihlásit k něčemu dlouhodobějšímu a vím, co od toho chci“, než jako jednorázová konzultace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Další věc je, že odpovědi na formulář by padaly do privátního kanálu #mentoři.
Tam by se sami mentoři mohli rozhodnout, zda mají danému juniorovi co nabídnout a v případě zájmu by se ozvali.
Tím by se zajistilo alespoň základní párování.
Junioři nebudou muset psát neznámým lidem podle několika klíčovým slovům a mentoři nebudou muset řešit, že se jim ozval někdo, komu vlastně neumějí pomoci.
Veřejný seznam mentorů v současné podobě by nejspíš úplně zmizel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="anketa"&gt;Anketa&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#anketa" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokračoval jsem ve tvorbě ankety pro juniory, na které pracuji spolu s ENGETO Academy.
Nakonec jsme ale schůzku posunuli na příští týden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zmínil jsem se na několika místech, že uvítáme někoho, kdo by nám s tím pomohl.
Dostal jsem díky tomu hned několik kontaktů, koho oslovit.
Tohle je text mého „inzerátu“:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure figure-blockquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sháním někoho, kdo rozumí anketám, dotazníkům, statistice.&lt;/strong&gt; Připravuji za junior.guru a spolu s ENGETO Academy anketu mezi juniory/začátečníky v programování a ocenili bychom před vypuštěním do světa review od odborníka (sociolog, statistik, prostě někdo, kdo nedělá anketu poprvé). Hledám tedy někoho, kdo by rozebral naše naivní představy na kousky a pomohl nám to zase složit dohromady. Jsme schopni za to zaplatit. Pokud máte tip, nebo se hlásíte, napište mi prosím.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="qa"&gt;Q&amp;amp;A&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#qa" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chtěl jsem vyplnit mezeru mezi přednáškami svou vlastní večerní Q&amp;amp;A.
Nestihl jsem to však nijak propagovat a nakonec jsem si z víkendu v Brně přivezl strašnou rýmu, tak jsem to posunul.
Mám připravený &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN235cq8xP4"&gt;stream na YouTube&lt;/a&gt; a měl bych teda nějak určit finální datum a začít to propagovat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tipy-pro-novacky-v-klubu-onboarding"&gt;Tipy pro nováčky v klubu (onboarding)&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#tipy-pro-novacky-v-klubu-onboarding" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Napadlo mě, jak řešit do budoucna tipy pro nováčky, které jsem programoval velkou část loňského roku a nakonec s nimi narazil na spoustu technických obtíží i na svou vlastní nechuť dál tuhle funkci rozvíjet.
Říkejme tomu třeba verze 1.
Toto je zpráva, kterou jsem napsal moderátorům v rámci přemýšlení nad verzí 2:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure figure-blockquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co kdyby byl jeden kanál typu fórum, kde by byly všechny tipy?
 Buď by je tam spravovalo kuře (má větší schopnosti, např. embedy a tak), nebo bych je tam psal já ručně (jednodušší a rychlejší na psaní a editaci).
 Zakládat nové tipy bych mohl jen já/kuře, lidi by mohli jen číst a komentovat ve vláknech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když by přišel nováček, udělal bych z něj akorát pomyslnou figurku, která by chodila po těch tipech.
 Pořadí tipů bych měl tímhle pod kontrolou bez ohledu na to, kdy byly napsány. Implementace „chození“ mě napadly dvě:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.  Kuře by mu udělalo v ten den mention do vlákna pod konkrétní tip, tím by mu přišla notifikace.
      Pak by tu zprávu hned smazalo, ale notifikace by přišla.
 2.  Kuře by posílalo člověku do soukromé zprávy odkaz na tip, podobně jako teď posílá špendlíky.
      Díky embedu atd. lze vytvořit docela pěkný náhled a odkaz, i když nejsou DM součástí klubu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kdo by si tip přečetl, dal by na něj nějakou reakci.
 Kuře by udělovalo roli „přečetl jsem všechny tipy“ (samozřejmě by ji snadno někdo mohl nafejkovat, prostě by vše poklikal, ale to je jedno).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Co by to řešilo?&lt;/strong&gt;
 Mnohem méně kódu, mohl bych se komplet zbavit managementu tisíce kanálů pro nováčky na Discordu.
 Existoval by veřejný registr tipů.
 Viděli bychom, zda to lidi čtou a které tipy.
 Lidi by si tipy mohli číst i volně bez ohledu na pořadí, klidně pět najednou, pokud mají chuť. Tipy by šlo ilustrovat obrázky nebo gify.
 Tipy by šlo kategorizovat tagy (Discord, placení, psaní do klubu...).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Co by to neřešilo?&lt;/strong&gt;
 Zpětnou vazbu od lidí bych sbíral jinak.
 Kanály na tipy na tohle stejně nefungují.
 Už teď jsem jednu z těch otázek dal přímo do checkoutu na Memberful, lidi to vyplňují, když jdou do klubu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nemám úplně vymyšlené, jak by to člověk vypnul, ale možná by prostě jen kuřeti napsal nějakou zprávu (to by vedlo spíš k variantě 2 ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Líbí se mi, jak některé nápady postupně zrají, když se jim dá čas.
Najednou to někam zacvakne a hned je jasné, jak to má být.
Vidím to teď po několika letech provozu JG na všech frontách.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ruzna-vylepseni"&gt;Různá vylepšení&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#ruzna-vylepseni" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Během těch dvou týdnů se mi několikrát stalo, že jsem měl menší chvilku času a chuť programovat.
Využil jsem to tedy k vyřešení několika drobných úkolů, které měly nízkou prioritu:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bot v klubu nyní kontroluje, zda je životnost Discord vláken nastavena na nejdelší možnou dobu.
    Výchozí doba je myslím tři dny, toto způsobuje, že vlákna se sama archivují až po týdnu.
    Při vytváření nových kanálů jsem to vždy zapomínal ručně nastavit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upravil jsem bota, abych dokázal lépe pracovat s konceptem rodičovského kanálu.
    Od dob, co jsou na Discordu vlákna a teď navíc fóra, mohou být kanály jakoby uvnitř jiných kanálů.
    Bot tohle zatím moc nevnímal.
    Nyní může vypsat do týdenního souhrnu v rámci jakého rodičovského kanálu se téma řešilo, nebo mu mohu říct, že některé kanály nemá vůbec číst, a to na základě ID rodičovského kanálu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Udělal jsem nějaké upgrady závislostí.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Začal jsem scrapovat počty svých &lt;em&gt;followers&lt;/em&gt; na YouTube a LinkedIn, abych je mohl případně sledovat v čase.
    Musím říct, že ani jedna z těch stránek není moc vlídná k tomu, aby z ní šlo něco programem zjistit, takže se mi tento malý úkol rozložil hned do několika dní.
    Nakonec se mi to ale &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/junior.guru/blob/e570f9bcf1b7fdf2216ce113d1337b1168ca2f4c/juniorguru/sync/followers.py"&gt;povedlo&lt;/a&gt;.
    Čísla si ukládám perzistentně tak, že je &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/junior.guru/blob/e570f9bcf1b7fdf2216ce113d1337b1168ca2f4c/juniorguru/data/followers.jsonl"&gt;commituji zpátky do repozitáře&lt;/a&gt;.
    Jde o JSONL soubor, kam se vždy přidá nový záznam pro nový měsíc.
    Až toho bude víc, dám to na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;/open/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Používám Fakturoid a mám ho napojený na bankovní účet, aby pároval faktury s transakcemi a automaticky je uměl označit jako zaplacené.
    Problém je, že od začátku JG mi na účet chodí i spousta věcí, které fakturu nemají.
    Dobrovolné příspěvky.
    Členství v klubu.
    A tak dále.
    Upozornění o nespárované platbě jsou jen upozornění a mohl bych je snadno všechny označit jako přečtené a neřešit je.
    Chtěl jsem nad tím však mít větší kontrolu a zachytit případné podezřelé platby.
    Na JG mám už dávno skript, který mi stahuje transakce z účtu na Fio a kategorizuje je.
    Stačilo tedy přidat něco, co se podívá i na Fakturoid a upozornění související se známými transakcemi by označilo jako přečtené.
    Tento úkol jsem rovněž očekával jednodušší a roztáhlo se mi to na několik dní.
    Zjistil jsem, že API Fio banky nejspíš vrací částky v JSONu jako float, místo aby je poslalo jako string a šlo z toho udělat &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html"&gt;decimal&lt;/a&gt; a následně deterministicky porovnat částky.
    Chtěl jsem kvůli tomu &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/fiobank"&gt;předělat celou svou knihovnu&lt;/a&gt;, ale nakonec jsem si v tom zabránil, nechal změny ležet na disku a vymyslel jiný způsob, jak to celé řešit.
    Nakonec jsem vyřešil ještě pět jiných zádrhelů, kvůli kterým se transakce nepárovaly s upozorněními ve Fakturoidu.
    Už to nicméně funguje.
    Objevil jsem díky dvě nebo tři podivné transakce, ale všechny měly nějaký dobrý důvod (např. vrácené daně z FÚ).
    Účel to tedy plní.
    Mimochodem, API Fakturoidu je &lt;a href="https://fakturoid.docs.apiary.io/"&gt;zdokumentováno v Apiary&lt;/a&gt;, kde jsem dřív pracoval.
    Zamáčkl jsem slzu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi"&gt;Další&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Předplatil jsem si svého oblíbeného tvůrce podcastů.
    Uvědomil jsem si, že od něj poslouchám (nebo jsem poslouchal) snad už deset různých podcastů.
    A že chodím na jeho web, když chci vědět, co je ve světě nového.
    Nemá Patreon ani HeroHero, ale nějaký &lt;a href="https://poplatek.rozhlas.cz/"&gt;svůj formulář&lt;/a&gt;.
    Naklikané to však bylo rychle a vygenerovalo to QR kód, který jsem hned zaplatil mobilní appkou své banky.
    Jde to zaplatit na rok dopředu, vychází to na pár stokorun.
    To mi přijde jako směšná cena za to všechno, co využívám.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poladil jsem barvy rolí v klubu, aby se nepletli lidi, kteří hodně pomáhají a moderátoři.
    Zdokumentoval jsem v klubu na nástěnku nějaké nové dobrovolné role, které jsem nedávno přidal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poslal jsem konečně daňařovi podklady pro přiznání.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Green Fox Academy se zeptali, zda by mohli do klubu posílat studenty.
    Napsal jsem jim, jak to funguje.
    Doteď jsem měl tohle jen se Software Development Academy a stále nevím, zda je to funkce, kterou bude chtít víc firem, nebo mám ten kód smazat.
    Jsem zvědav, zda se jim to bude líbit a půjdou do toho.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dělal jsem promo nové epizodě našeho &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/podcast/"&gt;podcastu&lt;/a&gt;.
    Mě se epizoda s Tomášem Ervínem Dombrovským moc líbila a zřejmě jsem nebyl sám.
    Na LinkedIn to &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/honzajavorek_deeptalks-data-trh-activity-7035958087731544064-DQze"&gt;mělo celkem dost sdílení a interakcí&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Snažil jsem se po kouskách dělat pořádak v rodinných a osobních financích.
    Počítal jsem si zpětně složený úrok p.a. z několika bizarních podílových fondů, jež jsem si kdysi dávno zřídil.
    Ani s kalkulačkou na &lt;a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/"&gt;WolframAlpha&lt;/a&gt;, která umí komplexní čísla a všemožné rovnice, se mi to ale nepovedlo.
    Nicméně jsem mnohem lépe pochopil, jak to celé funguje, a co bych měl s fondy do budoucna udělat.
    Zrušil jsem účet na Revolut a vše přesunul k Wise.
    Nakoupil jsem nějaká Eura na dovolenou, protože jsou teď levná.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Byli jsme v Brně na prodloužený víkend.
    Klasicky &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/bez-auta/"&gt;vlakem&lt;/a&gt;, tentokrát jsme vzali i kočár.
    Měli jsme strašně nabitý program jak jsme se snažili vidět co nejvíc kamarádů a rodiny a stihnout co nejvíc akcí (běh, &lt;a href="https://www.hrasendvic.cz/"&gt;Sendvič&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.artbar.club/events/mutanti-hledaj-vychodisko-don-juan-disco"&gt;koncert&lt;/a&gt;).
    Myslím, že jsme to trochu přehnali a měli jsme si to dát víc lážo plážo.
    Místy utrpělo naše zdraví i psychika.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Účastnil jsem se uživatelského testování appky &lt;a href="https://richbull.co/"&gt;RichBull&lt;/a&gt;, nového nástroje pro trackování investic.
    Dělá na tom kámoš a držím mu s tím palce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Propagoval jsem v klubu kurz pro začátečníky, který v Praze organizuje Pure Storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zase jsem někde &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1632675967859605506"&gt;prosil o RSS&lt;/a&gt;.
    Pokud vám stačí e-mail, odebírejte, vypadá to fajn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Udělal jsem po delší době zálohu fotek a systému.
    Dokončil jsem &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/isublime"&gt;program&lt;/a&gt;, který mi umožňuje nahrávat soubory na iCloud tak, že to vypadá, jako by je tam dalo jiné zařízení.
    To mi dovoluje nahrát tam spoustu archivních souborů, které si můj počítač stahuje až podle potřeby.
    Program je strašně pomalý a knihovna &lt;a href="https://github.com/picklepete/pyicloud/"&gt;pyicloud&lt;/a&gt;, nad kterou je postavený, má spoustu chyb, ale nějak to funguje a pár souborů jsem si takhle už „zazálohoval“.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Udělil jsem hned několik stipendií a další na mě čekají v e-mailu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Užil jsem si první závod letošní sezóny F1.
    Alonso je borec!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odpovídání v klubu, e-maily, &lt;a href="https://docs.pyvec.org/operations/support.html#sit-kontaktu"&gt;Pyvec Slack&lt;/a&gt;, atd.
    Upgradování závislostí na vlastních i Pyvec projektech (zpracovávání Pull Requestů, které průběžně posílá Dependabot).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 15 dní od 24. 2. do 10. 3. jsem naběhal 25 km, při procházkách nachodil 14 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 12 hodin a zdolal při tom 39 kilometrů.
    Část z těch naběhaných kilometrů byl &lt;a href="https://gici.behaj.cz/bbp-9-2023-beh-kolem-myslivny/"&gt;závod&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Udělal jsem něco z &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/strategie-na-2023/"&gt;plánů na rok 2023&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;„Vylepším zobrazení inzerátů na Discordu“ v podstatě hotovo!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;„Přidám Jobs.cz“ v podstatě hotovo!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dělám na „Budu se podílet na anketě mezi juniory“&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dělám na „vymýšlení MVP s tipy pro nové členy v klubu“&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blížím se k „Rozjedu pravidelné Q&amp;amp;A pro komunity“&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blížím se k „Pohraju si s AI“&lt;/li&gt;

Jeden z velitelů nám ostatně už v dubnu vyprávěl, že protitankové střely NLAW doručené z Británie měly často vadné spouštěcí baterie. Když s nimi voják vyběhl do boje, někdy teprve tváří v tvář tanku zjistil, že systém nefunguje – a s tankem v zádech musel rychle utíkat pryč. „Všechny vaše armády se na Ukrajině zbavují toho, co by už stejně musely vyřadit…“&lt;/li&gt;

Kniha otevírá dveře do československých ložnic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;„Někteří sexuologové a sexuoložky na konci 50. let tvrdili, že se muži mají více zapojovat do výchovy dětí a domácích prací, což mělo být jedinou cestou k ženskému orgasmu. Zároveň ale explicitně varovali před myšlenkou, že se dá kvalitnějšího sexu dosáhnout rozvíjením sexuálních technik. Tvrdili, že sexuální neduhy, a především ty ženské, může vyléčit jedině nové uspořádání rodiny, ve kterém si muž a žena budou rovni, budou si vědomi vzájemných závazků a budou se skutečně milovat… V šedesátých letech však přišel obrat. Pozornost se přesouvá z matky na dítě, jeho psychickou pohodu. Čím dál častěji je vyzdvihována role matky a obecně nastává návrat k tradičnímu pojetí rodiny a genderu.“&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;V sobotu jsme šli do &lt;a href="https://www.praha3.cz/aktualne-z-trojky/zpravy/zizkovsky-masopust-plny-hudby-her-nbsp-i-nbsp-jitrnic-n1156943.htm"&gt;masopustního průvodu na Praze 3&lt;/a&gt;.
Měl jsem děcko za krkem skoro celou dobu a protože tam hrála hudba, tak jsem dost i poskakoval do rytmu.
Byl silný chladný vítr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Výsledkem bylo, že jsem se v neděli zase složil.
Především fyzicky, ale v souvislosti s tím i psychicky.
Záda jsem měl úplně rozlámané, bolely mě ledviny nebo co a celkově jsem si připadal jako troska.
V pondělí jsem nikam nešel a neduhy se pokusil vyležet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domluvili jsme se doma, že uděláme vše pro to, abych se jako troska už necítil a abych už byl taky jednou chvíli zdravý a třeba i dobře vyspaný.
Změnili jsme, kde a jak spím.
Vymyslel jsem si režim na tento týden, který mi spaní umožňuje: žádné akce, žádný alkohol, žádné kafe.
Dávám si vitamíny a beru léky, které brát mám.
Jím ovoce.
Vstávám v 7:45 a snažím se jít spát kolem 23:00, i když si pak třeba ještě čtu.
Dopoledne chodím pracovat do coworku a snažím se věnovat hluboké práci, odpoledne dělám ještě nějakou administrativu a pak se věnuji rodině nebo něčemu, co by se dalo nazvat jako volný čas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dnes je pátek a cítím se nebývale dobře.
Tenhle režim je zatím spíš pokus a nevím, jak dlouho mi to vydrží.
Ani nevím, jestli takhle chci dlouhodobě žít.
Potřeboval jsem ale nějaký restart, nabrat energii.
Dokud mě to bude bavit, budu v tom pokračovat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="evidence-firem"&gt;Evidence firem&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#evidence-firem" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Povedlo se mi dodělat &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/#firemni-partnerstvi"&gt;evidenci firem&lt;/a&gt;.
Jediné, co chybí, je čtvrtletní e-mail, který by se firmám posílal.
To si ale asi nechám na jindy a pro teď už to prohlásím za hotové tak jak to je.
Nechci další týden věnovat tomu, že budu programovat e-mail firmám, potřebuji už změnit činnost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na každé stránce popisující detaily partnerství s firmou je poznámka, že je veřejná, ale že tam nemohou vyhledávače.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vysvětlil jsem tam, že ne všichni lidé, které někam zveme do podcastu nebo na přednášku, jsou nutně placená spolupráce.
    Přesunul jsem to pak &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/faq/#neoznacena-spoluprace"&gt;do FAQ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přidal jsem tam odkazy na statistiky inzerátů, pokud firma nějaké má.
    Doteď tyto odkazy chodily firmám e-mailem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zobrazil jsem v evidenci odkaz na oznámení spolupráce s firmou na sociálních sítích.
    Je to jeden z benefitů a chtěl jsem, aby bylo dohledatelné, kdy jsem to udělal a jak to vypadalo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Otevřel jsem si stránky partnerství s firmami v mobilu a opravil nejhorší prohřešky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obarvil jsem v &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/#firemni-partnerstvi"&gt;přehledu&lt;/a&gt; firmy, které budou brzy končit, abych věděl, že jim mám napsat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pokud jde o vzdělávací agenturu, přidal jsem na stránku text o konfliktu zájmů.
    Pak jsem ho zkrátil a zbytek dal &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/faq/#vzdelavaci-agentury"&gt;do FAQ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neplánovaně jsem aktualizoval a přepsal i &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/faq/#partnerstvi-s-firmami"&gt;další odstavce ve FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, které se týkají firem.
    Výsledek je zbytečně dlouhý a celé FAQ by potřebovalo aktualizovat a přepsat, ale už tak jsem s tím strávil celé jedno dopoledne a musím od toho dát rychle ruce pryč, jinak bych se v tom šťoural do Vánoc a ladil tam každé slovo.
    Někdy se k tomu vrátím.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přebudoval jsem kompletně jak bot vítá nové firmy v klubu.
    Hrál jsem si s tím snad celý jeden den.
    Dám sem screenshot, ale i ten je zastaralý, protože jsem to pak ještě vylepšoval.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;V poslední době se mezi inzeráty pro juniory objevovalo stále více a více chyb.
Hlavně tam padaly nějaké věci z elektro světa, které vůbec nebyly relevantní.
Už to začínalo smrdět syndromem rozbitých oken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jednoho rána jsem se už naštval a šel to opravit.
Samozřejmě mi to pak sežralo celý jeden pracovní den.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přidal jsem blocklist, kam jsem nasypal všechny ty elektro věci.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Všiml jsem si, že inzeráty z LinkedIn se stahují pomalu a prapodivně neefektivně.
    Poladil jsem nastavení scraperů a snad jsem to trochu zlepšil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zjistil jsem, že remoteok.com změnilo API a můj scraper kvůli tomu vytváří spoustu zbytečných requestů s redirecty.
    Spravil jsem to a počet potřebných requestů jsem odhadem snížil na polovinu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do seznamu FB skupin vhodných na hledání práce, který máme v klubu, jsem přidal jednu další.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;V úterý byla přednáška od Lukáše Pavelky.
Lukáš byl jedním z prvních členů klubu po jeho založení.
Pamatuji si, jak si hledal práci a dělali jsme mu review CVčka.
Teď juniorům přednášel 🐣
Promoval jsem to tímhle stylem i &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/honzajavorek_csharp-dotnet-windows-activity-7033421183077249024-2YkF/"&gt;na LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;.
Zdálo se mi, že to sdílelo hodně Lukášových kolegů, fandí mu 💪&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lukáš Pavelka" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid figure-img rounded" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/20230221-05d9cefc1d546427a86308899b81654dd15f5c4c9074cfed016a4128ec3321f9.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jak jsem psal minule, máme teď od Discordu na přednášky super vyladěný &lt;em&gt;stage&lt;/em&gt; kanál.
S Tinukim jsme ho vyzkoušeli.
Já jsem při tom omylem udělal notifikaci všem v klubu, ale nějak se to přežilo.
Zjistil jsem, že nemůžu do chatu na &lt;em&gt;stage&lt;/em&gt; před přednáškou nic napsat botem, protože je to nová věc a moje Discord knihovna to ještě neumí.
Založil jsem &lt;a href="https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord/issues/1934"&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt;.
Díky tomu jsem se dozvěděl, jak to mezitím mohu udělat jinak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když mám teď 24/7 coworking, tak mě napadlo, že bych mohl vzít přednášku odtamtud, abych s tím doma nerušil rodinu.
Přednášky se někdy protáhnou a dítě by už šlo spát, ale nemůže, protože mám pracovní místo v ložnici.
Chvíli mi trvalo na to přijít, jak si rezervovat v coworkingu zasedačku.
Když jsem na to přišel, tak jsem zjistil, že rezervace končí 17:30, pak už je to všem jedno.
Takže jsem nic na přednášku v 18:00 nerezervoval 😀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samotná přednáška byla v pohodě a nestalo se během ní nic zvláštního.
Tedy někdy uprostřed se mi úplně vybila sluchátka, ale zrovna jsem nemusel nic zhruba půl hodiny říkat, tak jsem si stihl odejít pro adaptér, sluchátka dobít a zase si je nasadit.
Protože nenahrávám, ale jen moderuji, tak nikdo nic nepoznal a bylo to úplně bez stresu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bezstavovy-realtime-bot"&gt;Bezstavový realtime bot&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#bezstavovy-realtime-bot" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nikdy jsem nechtěl na junior.guru žádnou „běžící aplikaci“, celé to běží asynchronně jednou denně na CI.
Na pár drobností v klubu by se však malý realtime pomocník hodil, ani by nemusel mít žádnou databázi, žádný stav.
Kdyby náhodou spadl kvůli chybě, nic zásadního by se nestalo.
Reagoval by jen na konkrétní situace a vylepšoval je, např. by hned založil vlákno pod příspěvek, aby měli moderátoři v některých případech méně otravné práce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sám jsem na to neměl čas, ale řekl jsem o tom jednomu (zatím tajnému) nadšenému programátorovi a ten to hned začal tvořit.
Každý druhý den mi posílá výsledky své práce a teď už mi poslal i hotový kód.
Valím bulvy!
A mám z toho velkou radost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teď ale musím vymyslet, jak to nasadíme a jak to budeme provozovat.
Problém je, že můj asynchronní bot bude potřebovat některé věci udělat úplně stejně, tak by se hodilo sdílet kód.
Zase mi přijde zbytečné takto jednoduchou a oddělenou věc dávat do tak velkého projektu s tolika závislostmi.
Zatím se kloním k tomu, že realtime bot bude mít svoje repo a zbytek junior.guru kódu si ho nějak nainstaluje jako závislost a použije některý kód jako sdílený.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Každopádně potřebuji další repo.
A už dřív jsem vytvořil repozitáře pro logo.junior.guru a podcast.junior.guru.
To už by byly celkem 4 repa a každý slušný člověk si na něco takového udělá na GitHubu organizaci.
Tak jsem ji vytvořil: &lt;a href="https://github.com/juniorguru/"&gt;github.com/juniorguru&lt;/a&gt;
Ještě tam není ani nové repo, ani hlavní repo.
Vyplňoval jsem nastavení, ověřoval domény, nahrával obrázek, vyplňoval profil, zval lidi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Organizace" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid figure-img rounded" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2023-02-24-at-16-01-37-junior-guru.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koukal jsem, co se rozbije, když přesunu repa, kde jsou GitHub Pages.
Jsou tam nějaké ofuky s ověřováním domén přes nějaké TXT záznamy, ale jinak v pohodě.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="GitHub Pages" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid figure-img rounded" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2023-02-24-at-16-01-01-build-software-better-together.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi"&gt;Další&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vymyslel jsem, jak vyřešit problém s oprávněním na vytváření událostí na Discordu.
    Chtěl jsem všem v klubu dát možnost vytvářet události, ale u tohoto oprávnění Discord vyžaduje 2FA.
    Všem v klubu tedy začalo vyskakovat, že si mají zapnout 2FA.
    Změnil jsem to tak, že existuje samoobslužná role „Organizuju akce“.
    Je u ní poznámka o 2FA a ti, kdo si ji nakliknou, vědí do čeho jdou.
    Zároveň si ji může nakliknout kdokoliv má zájem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vytvořil jsem dedikovanou stránku pro stipendium: &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/finaid/"&gt;junior.guru/finaid&lt;/a&gt;
    Jen přesměrovává na formulář, ale mohu na to teď snadno odkazovat.
    Všechny odkazy na webu jsem upravil tak, aby mířily na tuto stránku.
    Prošel jsem všechny maily, které posílám přes Memberful, a upravil to i všude tam.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přidal jsem &lt;a href="https://blog.zvestov.cz/"&gt;Luboše&lt;/a&gt; do mentorů.
    Nabídl se, že by mohl občas udělat pohovor nanečisto s Javou, kdyby měl někdo zájem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Využil jsem 20% slevu na F1 TV na roční předplatné.
    Těším se na nové Drive to Survive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Řešili jsme v klubu, zda si lidé mohou do svých deníčků komentovat, nebo ne.
    Každý to preferoval jinak.
    Vytvořili jsme štítky, které umožňují lidem předem signalizovat, co preferují.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Udělil jsem další stipendium.
    Jde hlavně o samoživitelky, tohle je snad pátá.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volali jsme si s ENGETO Academy a pokračovali v tvorbě ankety pro juniory.
    Blížíme se do finiše.
    Neznáte někoho, kdo umí dělat ankety a mohl by nám na to hodit odborné oko?
    Nějaký sociolog, statistik, někdo takový.
    Zaplatili bychom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doplňoval jsem informace k přednášce, kterou bude mít v klubu &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anastazie-sedlakova/"&gt;Nasťa&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Udělal jsem ještě na poslední chvíli v klubu promo na pohovory nanečisto s Ataccamou, ale pak jsem zjistil, že přihlášky jsou už uzavřené.
    Ups!
    Šárka mi potvrdila, že je to tak.
    Členům jsem se omluvil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poprvé jsem vzal dítě na cyklosedačku a projel jsem se s ním po Žižkově.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Napsal jsem jednomu borcovi, který na YouTube učí lidi Swift, jestli by nechtěl do klubu.
    Psal jsem mu už přes LinkedIn, ale nic, tak zkouším e-mail.
    Pak to asi vzdám.
    Neznáte někoho, kdo umí dělat iOS appky a chtěl by pomoci pár juniorům v jejich snažení?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Byl jsem na kafi s &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marta-k-586110243/"&gt;Martou&lt;/a&gt; a domlouvali jsme přednášku pro klub.
    Uvědomil jsem si díky ní zajímavou věc:
    Lidi v klubu se díky komunikaci přes Discord učí spolupracovat na dálku, asynchronně, učí se cally, ovládat něco jako Slack, atd.
    Práce na dálku je skill a junioři v klubu se v tom vlastně mimoděk trénují.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ze stránky s grafy jsem odstranil odkaz na nomadlist.com/open, protože už to autor webu odebral 🤷‍♂️
    Škoda.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Změnil jsem jak v klubu fungují studijní skupinky.
    Starý způsob byly privátní kanály, nový způsob jsou vlákna v kanálu typu „fórum“ pro každou skupinku.
    Diskutovalo se to i v klubu, někteří členové nechápali, proč jsou tam separátní uzavřené skupiny.
    Při revizi starých skupin jsme zjistili, že dvě už můžeme i smazat, takže jsem to udělal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vybral jsem si psychiatra (viz &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/tydenni-poznamky-schuzky-a-nekonecna-administrativa/"&gt;minulé poznámky&lt;/a&gt;) a objednal jsem se, tuším někam na červen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odpovídání v klubu, e-maily, &lt;a href="https://docs.pyvec.org/operations/support.html#sit-kontaktu"&gt;Pyvec Slack&lt;/a&gt;, atd.
    Upgradování závislostí na vlastních i Pyvec projektech (zpracovávání Pull Requestů, které průběžně posílá Dependabot).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 8 dní od 17. 2. do 24. 2. jsem ujel na kole 5 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 1 hodinu a zdolal při tom 5 kilometrů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finanční výsledky, návštěvnost a další čísla k JG &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;mám přímo na webu&lt;/a&gt;.
    Aktuální nabídky práce pro juniory: &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/dbbb7bf406b3c33aeba36cae817919d44bfb368a08fb1b4899dba130/"&gt;Processand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/ade40e530211c36a309fa370d270da7650ad18462c03c95b0b38de57/"&gt;Red Hat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Udělal jsem něco z &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/strategie-na-2023/"&gt;plánů na rok 2023&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hotovo: „Já i firma musíme mít včas informaci, že se blíží konec.“&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hotovo: „Firma musí vědět vše o svém předplatném, v jakém je stavu, kolik čeho zbývá.“&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Podílel jsem se na anketě mezi juniory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Když na něco narazím a líbí se mi to, sdílím to &lt;a href="https://t.me/honzajavorekcz"&gt;na Telegramu&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Celý týden se nesl v duchu nejrůznějších akcí a schůzek.
Skákal jsem od jednoho k druhému, ať už šlo o kafíčka a obědy s kamarády, vyzvedávání balíčků, přebírání klíčů nebo zapíjení narozených dětí.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K tomu se mi nahromadila nejrůznější administrativa a aktivita v klubu.
Až dnes jsem odpověděl na některé dva týdny staré e-maily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S evidencí firem jsem za uplynulý týden bohužel moc nepokročil.
Doladil jsem stránky pro jednotlivé firmy, tady například &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/redhat/"&gt;Red Hat&lt;/a&gt;.
Ještě tam není všechno, ale už to trochu připomíná něco užitečného.
Hned s několika firmami jsem diskutoval podobu té stránky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="valentynsky-darecek-od-discordu"&gt;Valentýnský dáreček od Discordu&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#valentynsky-darecek-od-discordu" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zjišťovali jsme, jak využít &lt;em&gt;push-to-talk&lt;/em&gt; na Discordu k tomu, aby se do přednášek nepřipojovali lidi se zapnutým mikrofonem a nerušili.
Využít to nejde, protože by si každý jeden uživatel musel pro tuto funkci nejdřív nastavit klávesovou zkratku.
Z hlediska použitelnosti to nic neřeší.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zasnili jsme se o tom, že by bylo super, kdyby Discord umožnil video a sdílení obrazovky ve &lt;em&gt;stage&lt;/em&gt; kanálech, kde je správa práv k mluvení během události řešená dokonale.
Bohužel doteď byly tyto &lt;em&gt;stage&lt;/em&gt; kanály jen hlasové, po vzoru někdejšího Clubhouse, sociální sítě, která byla populární během covidu, zhruba měsíc nebo dva, ehm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No a pak jsem se druhý den koukl do RSS čtečky a tam nový článek na blogu Discordu:
&lt;a href="https://discord.com/blog/introducing-video-screen-share-text-chat-support-for-stage-channels"&gt;Introducing Video, Screen Share, and Text Chat Support for Stage Channels&lt;/a&gt;
Zvýšili i limity pro počty lidí, takže limit na přednášky už nebudu mít 24 členů, ale třeba 100 nebo kolik.
Vlastně můžeme přestat streamovat na YouTube.
Nepřestaneme, protože to má i jiné výhody, ale prostě…
Chtělo se mi brečet dojetím 😀
Já tady rok něco řeším a pak otevřu blog a prostě je to konečně vyřešené, tím nejdokonalejším způsobem, přesně tak jak jsem si to přál!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Discord blog" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid figure-img rounded" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2023-02-17-at-17-13-45-introducing-video-screen-share-and-text-chat-support-for-stage-channels.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trochu jsem přeskládal klub a přidal tam další kanály typu fórum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přidal jsem nového moderátora, „povýšil“ jsem do této role svého pomocníka na videa Tinukiho, protože byl proaktivní a zodpovědný a má klub rád a tak vůbec.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vytvořil jsem „fórum“ na „volná témata“ a vcucnul do něj kanály o kávě, F1, Minecraftu a dětech.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kanál o kurzech jsem předělal na „fórum“ a přidal spoustu emoji s logy kurzů (abych je mohl použít na tématické štítky).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vytvořil jsem kanál s deníčky.
    Tento kanál se stal instantním úspěchem, po jednotkách dní si v něm svůj poloveřejný deníček o cestě k první práci v IT píše už 10 členů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vytvořil jsem „fórum“ na skupinky, který řeší více věcí najednou. Předně by snad mohl fungovat lépe než kanál na parťáky, kteří tímto zanikli.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Předělal jsem přednáškový kanál na &lt;em&gt;stage&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A tak dále, a tak dále, mohl bych pokračovat ještě deseti body, ale nevím, koho by to zajímalo.
    Klikal jsem na věci, nastavoval hejblátka, utahoval šroubky a přemýšlel nad tím, jak má co fungovat tak, aby to fungovalo co nejlíp.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Díval jsem se, co si členové klubu v prosinci „přáli od ježíška“ a většina z toho je splněna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Deníčky" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2023-02-17-at-17-13-01.png" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="problem-s-memberful-api"&gt;Problém s Memberful API&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#problem-s-memberful-api" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeden celý den jsem řešil, proč mi z ničeho nic, na Valentýna, jedno Memberful API vrací 403 a obskurní HTML chybu místo JSON odpovědi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Token správný.
IP adresa to není - z mého počítače i z produkce stejná chyba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zkusil jsem to přes Postman, funguje.
Zkusil jsem to přes curl, funguje.
Tak jsem udělal minimální dva řádky v Pythonu s requests knihovnou a ty nefungovaly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zapnul jsem veškeré logování Python vnitřností, abych dostal přesně bajty, které to posílá.
Zapnul jsem veškeré logování curl, abych dostal přesně bajty, které to posílá.
Jedno posílalo HTTP 1.1, druhé HTTP 2, ale tím to nebylo.
Když jsem u obou použil HTTP 1.1, stále to z Pythonu nefungovalo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tak jsem šel HTTP hlavičku po hlavičce a zkoušel rozdíly.
A zjistil jsem, že je problém s &lt;code&gt;User-Agent&lt;/code&gt;.
To je hlavička, kam jde napsat skoro cokoliv ve stylu „ahoj API, já jsem nástroj bla bla ve verzi 123“ a ani tam nemusí být.
Ve světe prohlížečů nebo při scrapování má větší význam, ale u API jsem nezažil, aby měla nějaký vliv.
Tady jsem zjistil, že hodnota &lt;code&gt;curl/7.85.0&lt;/code&gt; projde, ale &lt;code&gt;python-requests/2.28.2&lt;/code&gt; neprojde, Cloudflare to hodí přes palubu.
To druhé nastavuje Python knihovna requests standardně pro jakýkoliv request, který přes ni kdokoliv dělá.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Přijde mi to absurdní, prý to ale dělá i Wikipedia: &lt;a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User-Agent_policy"&gt;User-Agent policy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Etiquette"&gt;Etiquette&lt;/a&gt;.
Tak jsem to nastavil na &lt;code&gt;JuniorGuruBot (+https://junior.guru)&lt;/code&gt; a hotovo, funguje, to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na Memberful supportu mi trochu pomohli, ale spíš jsem si to musel vyřešit sám.
Napsal jsem jim druhý den čím to bylo a poděkovali mi s tím, že to asi není chtěné chování a že se poradí se svými provozáky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hledani-terapeutu-a-doktoru"&gt;Hledání terapeutů a doktorů&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#hledani-terapeutu-a-doktoru" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jako jeden z cílů na letošek jsem měl vyhledání psychoterapeuta.
O víkendu jsem si na to našel čas a nějaké terapeuty proklikal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Šel jsem na &lt;a href="https://dusevnizdravi.vzp.cz/seznam-terapeutu/"&gt;seznam od VZP&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vyřadil jsem ty, kteří nemají volno.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vyřadil jsem ty, kteří jsou moc daleko.
    Čím blíž bude, tím spíš tam budu schopen chodit.
    (Zatím zkouším najít prezenční terapii, tu online zkusím až kdyby to nevyšlo.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vyřadil jsem ty, kteří nemají zadanou žádnou webovku a nelze o nich nic zjistit.
    Tedy asi by o nich něco zjistit šlo, kdybych třeba hledal jejich jméno, ale to bych asi letos nestihl.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pár jsem si jich prošel a pak mi došly síly pokračovat ve výběru.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rozpracovaný seznam jsem si uložil a někdy se k němu zase vrátím.
Volně jsem místo toho přešel k výběru psychiatra, protože se to zdálo jednodušší.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="VZP" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid figure-img rounded" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2023-02-17-at-17-15-54-dusevni-zdravi-vzp-cr.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V uplynulém roce jsem díky osvětě v médiích dostal podezření, že mám AD(H)D.
Co jsem zatím zjistil, např. z &lt;a href="http://nepozornidospeli.cz/images/ADHD_prowebFIN.pdf"&gt;téhle příručky&lt;/a&gt;, mě utvrdilo v tom, že bych měl zjistit, jak to doopravdy je.
A to zjišťování se jmenuje diagnostika ADHD a dělá ji psychiatr, protože ADHD je vrozená nemoc a nemoci léčí doktor a doktor na duševní nemoci se jmenuje psychiatr.
Ideálně psychiatr, který něco o ADHD u dospělých ví.
A takových moc není, protože u dospělých se to začalo řešit až nedávno.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tím se ale dost zjednodušuje hledání!
Pro ujasnění, slovo „zjednodušuje“ v tomto případě znamená jen to, že nevybírám ze čtyř set stejně vypadajících položek, o nichž nelze nic dalšího dohledat.
Neznamená to, že je to nějak jednoduché.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V náhodné &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/ADHDdospeli/"&gt;Facebookovou skupině&lt;/a&gt; jsem v hloubi jejích připnutých příspěvků našel odkaz na &lt;a href="https://adhdospeli.cz/seznam-odborniku/"&gt;mapu s doktory&lt;/a&gt;.
K tomu jsem ještě vyhledal lidi, kteří se o ADHD u dospělých vyjadřovali jako odborníci do různých médií.
Předpokládám, že pokud někdo dělá na ČRo osvětu o ADHD u dospělých, tak o tom nejspíš něco ví.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Našel jsem asi 10 zařízení, do kterých jsem napsal stejný e-mail:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure figure-blockquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dobrý den&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;je mi 36 let a v uplynulém roce jsem díky osvětě v médiích dostal podezření, že mám AD(H)D. Co jsem zatím zjistil, např. z http://nepozornidospeli.cz/images/ADHD_prowebFIN.pdf, mě utvrdilo v tom, že bych měl zjistit, jak to doopravdy je.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chtěl bych se zeptat, zda se na diagnostiku ADHD u dospělých specializujete, zda berete nové klienty, a zda lze na vaše služby nějak uplatnit moje zdravotní pojištění u VZP. Případně jestli nemáte tip na jiného doktora v Praze, který by mi mohl v mém snažení pomoci.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Díky,
Honza Javorek&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Většinou mi během týdne napsali, že mají beznadějně plno, ale dostával jsem i vtipnější odpovědi.
Každopádně mi z toho vyšli zhruba dva doktoři.
Jeden má čas v květnu a druhý v červnu.
O víkendu se chci rozhodnout a někam se objednat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publikoval jsem &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/podcast/"&gt;novou epizodu podcastu&lt;/a&gt; s Tomášem Ervínem Dombrovským z LMC a je to libový, poslechněte si to!
    Každou druhou větu bych mohl citovat v příručce.
    Posílám srdíčka!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kamarádka má zaplacený ještě měsíc a půl v nedalekém coworkingu a nevyužije ho už.
    Nejde to zrušit.
    Tak mi to podarovala a budu tam teď asi chodit.
    Už jsem tam jedno odpoledne zkoušel pracovat a nebylo to vůbec špatné!
    Jsem zvědav, jaký si vymyslím režim.
    Je to pěkná příležitost si to vyzkoušet.
    Těším se na změnu a experimentování.
    Kamarádce tímto ještě jednou děkuji!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7032007586929344513/"&gt;Podpořil jsem PyCon NA na LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; a dal jsem to i do klubu.
    Někteří opravdu přispěli, jóóóó!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zjišťoval jsem, proč lidé nemohou vytvářet události v klubu, i když jsem na to dal práva všem členům.
    Nakonec se ukázalo, že Discord to považuje za funkci s širším oprávněním, u které vyžaduje, aby člověk měl přihlašování s 2FA.
    To je milé, ale mohli to napsat do té chybové hlášky.
    Nejsem sám, kdo z toho byl zmatený: &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/qvec5s/cant_schedule_events_in_a_server_i_admin/"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/u7cavj/create_events_missing_permissions/"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Napsal jsem jednomu borcovi, který na YouTube učí lidi Swift, jestli by nechtěl do klubu.
    Napsal jsem jedné přednášející &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/reactgirlsprague_meetup-activity-7029815878296698880-YOFC"&gt;odjinud&lt;/a&gt;, zda by nechtěla přednášet i v klubu.
    Psal jsem si s &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anastazie-sedlakova/"&gt;Nasťou&lt;/a&gt; a domlouval její přednášku v klubu.
    Přidal jsem nového mentora, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinkolareu/"&gt;Martina&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Udělal jsem review snad na pět CVček.
    V klubu se tohle teď fakt rozjelo.
    Vytvořil jsem dobrovolnou roli v klubu pro ty, kdo by s tímhle chtěli pomoci, ale zatím jsem tam jen já a Dan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ve &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/cz/podcast/tv%C5%AFrcast/id1657971770"&gt;Tvůrcastu&lt;/a&gt; jsem slyšel o &lt;a href="http://www.festivalopsani.cz/"&gt;Festivalu o psaní&lt;/a&gt; a hned jsem si koupil lístek.
    Psát dokážu, ale mohl bych to umět lépe.
    Už delší dobu cítím velké mezery v tom, jak úderně nebo stručně dokážu psát.
    Měl bych se v tom cíleně začít zlepšovat, pokud chci, aby psaní bylo můj primární způsob tvorby obsahu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uložil jsem si do osobního kalendáře termíny všech letošních závodů F1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nabídl jsem dvěma lidem, jestli nechtějí naprogramovat něco, co by se mohlo stát součástí junior.guru.
    Jsem zvědav, jak to dopadne.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vytvořil jsem skript, který možná pomůže jednomu členovi klubu s psychikou a organizací sebe sama.
    Uvidíme.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Konečně jsem si našel čas pohrát si s ChatGPT.
    API mají, takže zvažuji, jak to využít v klubu.
    Mimochodem, &lt;a href="https://app.gumroad.com/d/0b51ea811553c333113e727b0f055efe"&gt;MacGPT&lt;/a&gt; vypadalo jako užitečná appka, ale jak bývá teď ChatGPT dost přetížené, je asi lepší chodit rovnou přes web.
    Mají tam nějaké kontroly prohlížeče, aby se bránili proti robotům, a vypadá to, že MacGPT tím mnohdy neprojde.
    Přidal jsem se taky na OpenAI Discord.
    Ze zvědavosti.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jedna firma mi napsala nedočkavý e-mail, že kdy už si bude moci zaplatit zvýraznění v katalogu vzdělávacích agentur a jestli už existuje.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opravoval jsem odkaz, který má z junior.guru mířit na Red Hat.
    Překvapilo mě, že není jen v nabídkách práce, ale mám ho na mnohem víc místech, dokonce i přímo v příručce.
    Na to jsem však přicházel postupně, vždy když mi někde selhala kontrola odkazů, apod.
    Byl to tedy větší úkol, než jsem čekal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odsouhlasili jsme si prodloužení spolupráce s firmou, která má logo na příručce a platí si nejdražší tarif.
    Penízky, penízky!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Až před časem jsem zjistil, že v Pythonu mohu použít &lt;code&gt;%-d&lt;/code&gt; pro formátování např. dne v týdnu, místo &lt;code&gt;%d&lt;/code&gt;.
    S tím spojovníkem to nevypíše nulu před číslem, takže květen je 5 a ne 05.
    Nyní jsem změnil i starší kód tak, aby tuto věc využíval a je to krásné.
    Bohužel jsem při hledání a nahrazování udělal špatně odhalitelnou chybu.
    Na tu mě upozornil až kamarád, který si četl stránku s grafy a bylo mu divné, jak vypadá graf s počtem příspěvků v klubu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graf s počtem příspěvků v klubu jsem nakonec stejně změnil na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/#aktivita-v-klubu"&gt;graf počtu napsaných písmenek&lt;/a&gt;.
    Přijde mi to adekvátnější číslo lépe reflektující úsilí vložené do psaní zpráv, než počet zpráv.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opravil jsem malou chybu ve věci, která sdílí články z toho blogu na Telegram.
    Už to začínám mít fakt vyladěné.
    Myslím, že už mám &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety%E2%80%93ninety_rule"&gt;90 % hotovo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odpovídání v klubu, e-maily, &lt;a href="https://docs.pyvec.org/operations/support.html#sit-kontaktu"&gt;Pyvec Slack&lt;/a&gt;, atd.
    Upgradování závislostí na vlastních i Pyvec projektech (zpracovávání Pull Requestů, které průběžně posílá Dependabot).
    Bylo toho nějak moc!
    Mám pocit, že za poslední týden se v klubu jen představovalo 15 nových lidí.
    Lidi dávali CVčka na review, diskutovali.
    Nestíhal jsem odpovídat na e-maily.
    Nestíhal jsem pracovat na jiných věcech.
    Uf.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 8 dní od 10. 2. do 17. 2. jsem naběhal 13 km, při procházkách nachodil 12 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 7 hodin a zdolal při tom 25 kilometrů.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Udělal jsem něco z &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/strategie-na-2023/"&gt;plánů na rok 2023&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V podstatě jsou skoro hotové „firma musí vědět vše o svém předplatném, v jakém je stavu, kolik čeho zbývá“ a „já i firma musíme mít včas informaci, že se blíží konec“, i když bych si je představoval trochu lepší.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zapracoval jsem na „najdu si terapeuta“.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Udělal jsem „pohraju si s AI“, i když jsem si to teda spíš představoval tak, že opravdu už naprogramuju něco, co to využívá.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;V klubu proběhla přednáška od &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zuzanapechova/"&gt;Zuzany Pechové&lt;/a&gt;.
Mělo to nejživější diskuzi, jakou pamatuju.
Dostali jsme se poprvé v historii klubu na strop 25 lidí na video hovoru.
Byla tam spousta užitečných tipů a všem se to moc líbilo!
V klubu 20 reakcí na záznam přednášky a záznam má po dvou dnech skoro 90 &lt;em&gt;views&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Podle mě to bylo jednoznačně poučné a zároveň podané formou, kterou junior pochopí.
Kombinace obojího se moc nevidí.
Spoustu zajímavých věcí jsem se dověděl i já.
Něco málo o bezpečnosti vím, ale moc se v tom nerochním, takže jsem byl rád za výlet do tématu.
A dověděl jsem se i dobré tipy, které by se daly dát časem na web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Plakát k přednášce" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid figure-img rounded" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/20230207-3f4025980ff02dba215a2a5c26de32b5dbc2f9e1a7bc3dcd44c45fc83495afc1.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co se týče techniky, tak záznam zajišťoval Tinuki a opět vše skvěle klaplo.
Sice jsme dosáhli na strop účastníků, ale byl k dispozici online stream na YouTube, takže kdo by se chtěl ještě přidat, mohl přednášku aspoň sledovat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Při velké účasti se však hned několikrát stalo, že se připojili lidi se zapnutým mikrofonem, aniž by si to uvědomili, a způsobili tak nepříjemný ruch.
Tohle s Tinukim zkusíme vyřešit zapnutím &lt;em&gt;push-to-talk&lt;/em&gt; v přednáškárně pro běžné smrtelníky, ale nejdříve to chceme vyzkoušet.
Také jsem dal Tinukimu oprávnění vypínat druhým lidem mikrofon, pokud by byl rychlejší než já.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="evidence-firem"&gt;Evidence firem&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#evidence-firem" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokročil jsem v programování transparentní evidence partnerství s firmami.
Z výsledku mám radost, ale zároveň jsem tento týden věnoval možná až moc času různé administrativě a proto není evidence stále ještě hotová.
Máme půlku února a &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/strategie-na-2023/"&gt;plánů na rok 2023&lt;/a&gt; mě čeká ještě spousta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kód je nyní schopen zjistit, jestli byla firma uvítána v klubu a kdy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dokumentuji si do YAMLu, zda jsem firmu uvítal na sociálních sítích a kdy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dokumentuji si do YAMLu všechna další ujednání, která s firmami mám.
    Nejen abych byl transparentní, ale také abych si to sám pamatoval.
    Takhle budeme já i firma hned vědět, co jsme si domluvili nad rámec ceníku, co už je hotovo, a co chybí.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doplnil jsem kód, který mi umožňuje vypsat benefity z tarifu, které jsou obohaceny o informaci, zda je daný benefit už splněn.
    Téměř vše se samo zjišťuje z databáze.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opravil jsem propojení firem a podcastů, našel jsem v tom chybu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přidal jsem hromadu testů na různé části kódu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Partnerská stránka" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid figure-img rounded" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2023-02-10-at-11-55-14-partnerstvi-s-firmou-red-hat.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figure-caption"&gt;
Zatím jsou informace jen tak ledabyle naházené do stránky. Ale jsou tam!&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="e-maily-na-memberful"&gt;E-maily na Memberful&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#e-maily-na-memberful" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chtěl jsem v Memberful nastavit e-mail, který se lidem pošle, když zruší předplatné.
Cílem bylo především doručit k nim informaci, že mohou zažádat o stipendium, pokud jim klub přijde příliš drahý.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Posílání e-mailu jsem zapnul a sepsal jsem jeho obsah.
Prošel jsem ale i všechny zbylé e-maily a aktualizoval je.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Nastavení e-mailů v Memberful" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2023-02-10-at-11-57-51-subscription-canceled.png" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Změnil jsem tón e-mailů a osobu, která je píše.
Původně to chodilo z &lt;code&gt;hello@&lt;/code&gt;, teď to chodí z &lt;code&gt;kure@&lt;/code&gt; a texty jakoby píše můj robot kuře.
V prvních e-mailech se lidem představí, v dalších už jen navazuje prostým „Ahoj, tady kuře.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Přijde mi to lepší, než se tvářit, že e-maily píšu já osobně.
Stále je to vše přátelským tónem, ale už to jasně dává najevo, že jde o automaticky posílaný e-mail.
Lidé mohou na e-mail odpovědět a mají informaci, že taková odpověď přijde přímo mně a budu ji řešit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Podobně můj „robot kuře“ komunikuje i v klubu, takže to lidi znají i odtamtud.
Lidé vědí, že mi pomáhá a je stejně „zábavné“ jako já, ale že je to jen robot.
Ideálně by veškerá má automatizovaná komunikace byla „od kuřete“, ať už jde o zprávy na Discordu nebo e-maily, zatímco živé odpovědi jsou „od Honzy“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jako kuře se identifikují i commity v Gitu, které automaticky posílám ze CI na GitHub (např. když CI nechám formátovat kód).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V souvislosti s tím vším jsem registroval pro e-mail &lt;code&gt;kure@&lt;/code&gt; i &lt;a href="https://gravatar.com"&gt;Gravatar&lt;/a&gt;, aby si různé služby mohly k této adrese automaticky přiřadit obrázek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi"&gt;Další&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kontaktoval jsem daňaře, že bychom měli začít pracovat na přiznání.
    Vyžádal si podklady a teď je řada zase na mé straně.
    Až doděláme přiznání, vrhneme se na přechod na identifikovanou osobu, abych mohl i jako neplátce DPH volně nakupovat služby z EU.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Docházejí mi přednášející.
    Nějak jsem je zapomněl shánět.
    Kamarádka mi dala pár tipů na lidi, kteří se zabývají testováním.
    Komunikuji také s programátorkou, která by mohla mít přednášku o tom, jak v IT zvládat práci a děti.
    Chtělo by to ale přitlačit a domluvit zase nějakých třeba pět přednášek dopředu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psal jsem na Memberful support a posílal jim chyby v českém překladu.
    Překlady objednávají u externího dodavatele, takže jejich odpověď byla spíš vlažná.
    Nejspíš tedy budou místo dobropisu nadále posílat „dluhovou poznámku“.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poprvé v historii junior.guru se mi stalo, že mi poptávku na partnerství s klubem poslala firma, kterou neznám, s lidmi, které neznám.
    Pracovní inzeráty chtěly vystavit různé firmy, ale partnerství za spoustu peněz, to byla vždy záležitost nějakých kontaktů, srazů, konferencí, kamarádů.
    Green Fox Academy se mi sice taky ozvali sami, ale tam jsme o sobě dlouhodobě tak nějak věděli, protože podnikáme v podobném segmentu.
    Firmu jsem rychle během týdne zprocesoval a brzy bude mít logo na webu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volal jsem si s ENGETO Academy, abychom se zase o kousek posunuli v přípravách ankety pro juniory.
    Šlo nám to hezky od ruky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dobrý kamarád plánuje poslat CVčko na &lt;em&gt;dream job&lt;/em&gt;, který si někde vyhlédl.
    Nějaký čas jsem tedy strávil tím, abych se na to všechno podíval, okomentoval mu to a dal mu spoustu doporučení.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V 1Password doplňku do Firefoxu mi přestalo fungovat přihlášení přes TouchID.
    Našel jsem na internetu nějakou radu, že s verzí 8 to nefunguje.
    To mě rozčílilo a napsal jsem emotivní zprávu na jejich support.
    Než odpověděli, začalo to samo zase fungovat.
    Možná se něco aktualizovalo, nebo restartovalo.
    Byli milí a trpěliví.
    Upozornili mě, že rada z fóra je 2 roky stará a že by to fungovat mělo.
    Dali mi tipy a poslali dotazy, aby mi pomohli problém odladit.
    Omluvil jsem se jim a poděkoval za trpělivost s takovými panikařícími lidmi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zdá se, že jsem konečně opravil kapající vodovodní kohoutek v kuchyni.
    Dřívější výměna těsnění nepomohla, tak jsem na bráchovu radu vyměnil celé kartuše a to asi zabralo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Objevil jsem fotobanku &lt;a href="https://www.stockai.com/"&gt;stockai.com&lt;/a&gt; a uložil jsem si ji s tím, že do příštích poznámek dám úvodní obrázek z ní.
    Teď jsem to otevřel a už ten projekt neexistuje 😂
    Že je teď AI velký hype a probíhá v téhle oblasti překotný organický vývoj, to jsem tak nějak tušil, ale že něco zmizí z týdne na týden, to mě překvapilo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odpovídání v klubu, e-maily, &lt;a href="https://docs.pyvec.org/operations/support.html#sit-kontaktu"&gt;Pyvec Slack&lt;/a&gt;, atd.
    Upgradování závislostí na vlastních i Pyvec projektech (zpracovávání Pull Requestů, které průběžně posílá Dependabot).
    I když toho nebylo v klubu tento týden nějak moc, několik dní po sobě jsem se tam na pár hodin zasekl.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 8 dní od 3. 2. do 10. 2. jsem při procházkách nachodil 13 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 7 hodin a zdolal při tom 13 kilometrů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finanční výsledky, návštěvnost a další čísla k JG &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;mám přímo na webu&lt;/a&gt;.
    Aktuální nabídky práce pro juniory: &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/dbbb7bf406b3c33aeba36cae817919d44bfb368a08fb1b4899dba130/"&gt;Processand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/34fa3ec07892dd3ff64458e2ccbf12578e00860483427e9e7c4847bc/"&gt;Red Hat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Udělal jsem něco z &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/strategie-na-2023/"&gt;plánů na rok 2023&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daří se „Budu se podílet na anketě mezi juniory.“&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přiblížil jsem se ke splnění „Vyladím customer journey. Firma musí vědět vše o svém předplatném, v jakém je stavu, kolik čeho zbývá.“&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přiblížil jsem se ke splnění „Vyladím customer journey. Já i firma musíme mít včas informaci, že se blíží konec.“&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přiblížil jsem se ke splnění „Začneme označovat epizody podcastu, které jsou finančně podpořené spoluprací s firmami.“&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přiblížil jsem se ke splnění „Stanu se identifikovanou osobou.“&lt;/li&gt;

Je příjemné si po slibech a prohlášeních politiků jednou poslechnout někoho, kdo se vládě snaží radit a reálně přemýšlí, jak by šlo problémy vyřešit, se všemi klady a zápory. Jediné, co mě tahalo za uši, bylo převedení peněz z daně z nemovitosti z obcí na stát, ale je možné, že to říkal v kontextu „aby tahle konkrétní daň pomohla řešit strukturální deficit, muselo by se stát tohle“ a ne, že by to navrhoval a myslel si, že je to dobrý nápad.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pokud vás napadá, co by kalendář mohl umět, ale nehodláte jej aktivně sami používat, tak svůj nápad napište na kompostovatelný papírek, udělejte z něj vlaštovku a pošlete jej z okna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dříve už jsem takových kalendářů vytvořil hromady, ale s knihovnou &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/ics/"&gt;ics&lt;/a&gt;.
Její vývoj je však nějaký divoký a pomalý, dlouho jsem musel používat nějakou verzi z Gitu, takže jsem tentokrát vyzkoušel knihovnu &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/icalendar/"&gt;icalendar&lt;/a&gt;.
Tu jsem objevil díky tomu, že ji použila Mia Bajić, když vytvářela &lt;a href="https://github.com/pyvec/pyvo-bot/"&gt;pyvo-bot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moje hodnocení?
Na čtení staženého kalendáře je možná jednoduchá, ale na vytváření je to o dost víc práce, než s ics.
Přijde mi, že icalendar mi dává pár vychytávek navíc oproti tomu, kdybych se ten textový soubor snažil vytvořit ručně, ale abych něco doopravdy vytvořil, musím ten formát docela detailně znát a trávit čas čtením specifikace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abych mohl věc vůbec dokončit, pomohl mi dost &lt;a href="https://icalendar.org/validator.html"&gt;online iCalendar validátor&lt;/a&gt; a stejně jsem se ještě půl hodiny motal v časových pásmech, než se to začalo v mém Google Kalendáři zobrazovat správně.
Oproti tomu, když jsem dřív používal ics, většinou stačilo nasypat do něj data podle dokumentace a i když jsem o iCalendar formátu nic moc nevěděl, vygenerovalo mi to přesně to, co jsem chtěl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category></entry><entry><title>Týdenní poznámky: Schůzky a evidence firemních partnerství</title><link href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/tydenni-poznamky-schuzky-a-evidence-firemnich-partnerstvi/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-02-03T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-02-03T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Honza Javorek</name></author><id>tag:honzajavorek.cz,2023-02-03:/blog/tydenni-poznamky-schuzky-a-evidence-firemnich-partnerstvi/</id><summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utekl zas nějaký ten týden (27. 1. až 3. 2.) a tak &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/tydenni-poznamky-jeseniky-a-fora-na-discordu/"&gt;stejně jako minule&lt;/a&gt; sepisuji, co jsem dělal a co jsem se naučil.

&lt;h2 id="evidence-firem"&gt;Evidence firem&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#evidence-firem" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokračoval jsem v převádění evidence firem z Excelové tabulky do YAMLu napojeného na zbytek JG:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Začal jsem načítat data z YAMLu místo z Excelu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Informace o firemních kupónech nemohou být v YAMLu, protože jsou neveřejné.
    Stahují se tedy přímo z Memberful API.
    Při té příležitosti jsem trochu vylepšil třídu, přes kterou k jejich GraphQL API přistupuji.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přidal jsem varování, když mám v kódu logo firmy, které už skončilo partnerství.
    Chtěl jsem pak loga promazat, ale zjistil jsem, že se používají i jinde (např. na upoutávkách k akcím v klubu).
    Taky jsem zjistil, že i když se nepoužívají, mám kód blbě a spadne to.
    Takže jsem radši zatím nic nemazal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Propojil jsem vzájemně všechny informace pomocí tabulek a cizích klíčů v SQLite.
    Firmy a údaje o jejich partnerství jsou teď asi nejpropletenější tabulky na JG.
    Celkem jsem se u toho zapotil a musel jsem si dost osvěžit SQL.
    Mám to pokryté hromadou testů, protože jsem si vůbec nevěřil a polovina mého programování byla pokus-omyl.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web jsem napojil na nová data.
    Na příručce se tedy vypisují loga už na základě toho, že systém ví, že dané firmy mají určitý tarif a jeho součástí je logo na příručce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kromě epizod podcastu jsem s daty o firmách propojil i akce v klubu.
    Nově mohu přednášku označit jako partnerskou, pokud si ji firma zaplatila.
    Stejně jako u epizod podcastu, nikde se to zatím neprojeví, je to pouze v datech.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mám připravený kód, který dokáže vypsat všechny benefity určitého tarifu.
    Volitelně buď bez těch, které zdědil od nižších tarifů, nebo s nimi.
    To se bude hodit, až budu chtít na web vypsat ceník pro firmy (aktuálně je v Google dokumentu).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firmy se ve výpisu na webu řadí nově zaprvé podle toho, jaký mají tarif, zadruhé abecedně podle názvu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Při předělávání evidence firem jsem si uvědomil, že &lt;code&gt;company&lt;/code&gt; a &lt;code&gt;companies&lt;/code&gt; jsou špatné názvy.
    I v češtině jsem v tom měl zmatek, někde „spolupráce“, někde „sponzorování“.
    Říká se, že pojmenovávání věcí je jedna ze dvou nejtěžších věcí v programování.
    Já jsem velkým zastáncem toho, že pojmenování je hodně důležité a jsem trochu ovlivněný věcmi jako &lt;em&gt;ubiquitous language&lt;/em&gt; z &lt;em&gt;Domain-Driven Designu&lt;/em&gt; apod.
    Našel jsem vhodnější termín pro firmy a entity kolem nich, a to &lt;code&gt;partner&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;partnership&lt;/code&gt;.
    V češtině „partner“, „partnerství“.
    Podle mě to nejlépe popisuje vztah, který s firmou máme.
    Do budoucna mi to umožňuje mít v systému i další firmy, které jsou se mnou v jiném vztahu.
    Například inzerenti pracovních nabídek, nebo vzdělávací agentury v katalogu.
    Udělal jsem velkou &lt;em&gt;search &amp;amp; replace&lt;/em&gt; akci, při které jsem termíny všude v kódu změnil a sjednotil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;/open/&lt;/a&gt; jsem vytvořil novou sekci, &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/#firemni-partnerstvi"&gt;Firemní partnerství&lt;/a&gt;.
    V souvislosti s tím jsem nahoru na stránku přidal osnovu stránky, ať se v tom dá aspoň trochu vyznat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V nové sekci jsem nejdřív pouze vypsal firmy do tabulky a poslal to na produkci.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Díky &lt;a href="https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/discussions/3118"&gt;dotazu&lt;/a&gt; jsem zjistil, jak mohu dynamicky generovat stránky pro svoje MkDocs.
    Je na to plugin &lt;a href="https://oprypin.github.io/mkdocs-gen-files/"&gt;mkdocs-gen-files&lt;/a&gt;.
    Tím je definitivně vyřešena poslední věc, kterou jsem si nebyl jistý, jak v MkDocs udělám, až ji budu potřebovat.
    Cesta k tomu, abych zrušil starou část JG postavenou na Flasku, je umetená!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vzápětí jsem použil ještě plugin &lt;a href="https://github.com/lukasgeiter/mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin"&gt;awesome-pages&lt;/a&gt;, který mi umožnil vygenerované stránky jednoduše zahrnout do navigace MkDocs.
    Sice mi trvalo snad hodinu, než jsem to rozchodil a pochopil, ale už mi to funguje.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vytvořil jsem tedy dynamicky pro každou firmu stránku.
    Na tyto stránky teď odkazuji z tabulky firem v oné nové sekci &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/#firemni-partnerstvi"&gt;Firemní partnerství&lt;/a&gt;.
    Zatím na těch stránkách nic není, ale dalším krokem bude výpis všech benefitů, které má firma objednané, a dalších údajů o partnerství firmy s JG.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Těmto novým stránkám jsem nastavil &lt;code&gt;noindex&lt;/code&gt; pro vyhledávače.
    Nemají být „tajné“, ale nepotřebuji, aby vyskakovaly někde ve výsledcích vyhledávání.
    A určitě nechci, aby na výraz „ENGETO Academy“ někdo našel tohle, místo aby našel jejich budoucí stránku v katalogu vzdělávacích agentur, který letos vyrobím.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="blog"&gt;Blog&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#blog" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upravil jsem bota, který hází do &lt;a href="https://t.me/honzajavorekcz"&gt;mé Telegramové skupiny&lt;/a&gt; odkazy na články, které vydám tady na blogu.
Snad budou teď náhledové obrázky fungovat ještě o něco lépe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na blogu používám tagování článků, ačkoliv tagy samotné nikde nevypisuji.
Mám je však přístupné z kódu, který sestavuje blog.
Např. se díky přiřazenému tagu dá vypsat „největší pecky“ na &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog"&gt;hlavní stránce blogu&lt;/a&gt;.
Upravil jsem články tak, aby poznámky měly tag „týdenní poznámky“ a všechny články související s JG aby měly tag „junior.guru“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Povolil jsem pak v &lt;a href="https://getpelican.com/"&gt;Pelicanu&lt;/a&gt; generování RSS pro jednotlivé tagy s tím, že se mi to může v budoucnu hodit při nějaké automatizaci, např. pokud bych chtěl věci související s JG zobrazovat na samotném JG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="schuzky"&gt;Schůzky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#schuzky" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sešel jsem se s kamarádkou a radil jsem jí, jak začít jako tvůrce (např. videí).
    Ona mi na oplátku řekla drby o jedné firmě, která fušuje do vzdělávání.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sešel jsem se s &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariankamenistak/"&gt;Mariánem Kameništákem&lt;/a&gt;, který mě už dříve kontaktoval.
    Hledali jsme průsečíky toho, co děláme.
    Konkrétní závěry nemáme, ale byl to příjemný pokec.
    Možná uděláme přednášku v klubu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://rozbiteprasatko.cz/"&gt;Jakub „Rozbité prasátko“ Dvořák&lt;/a&gt; vydal knihu.
    Píšou o něm &lt;a href="https://cc.cz/staci-jeden-akciovy-index-a-do-konce-zivota-nemusite-nic-delat-rika-autor-rozbiteho-prasatka/"&gt;na CC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCcGZDi-hCs"&gt;byl u Vojty Žižky&lt;/a&gt;.
    Kniha se hned vyprodala.
    Jakub mě pozval na křest knihy.
    Nikdy jsem na žádné takové akci nebyl.
    Měl jsem to kousek a moc jsem si to užil.
    Byl tam i ten Vojta Žižka, ale bavil jsem se spíš se spoustou jiných zajímavých lidí, na které jsem tam narazil.
    S redaktorem Jakubova nakladatelství jsem např. diskutoval, jak by šlo vydat příručku na JG jako knihu.
    Překvapilo mě, že JG znal.
    Přesvědčoval mě, že by to vydat šlo a že kdybych to chtěl udělat, ať se mu určitě ozvu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na online schůzce jsem s ENGETO Academy posunul přípravy společné ankety mezi juniory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zdrazeni-clenum-v-klubu"&gt;Zdražení členům v klubu&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#zdrazeni-clenum-v-klubu" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Přišel únor a s ním zdražení pro stávající členy klubu.
Zkontroloval jsem všechny kupóny a opravil jejich nastavení.
Pak jsem se zhluboka nadechl a použil jsem v Memberful funkci &lt;a href="https://memberful.com/help/manage-your-members/move-all-members-of-a-plan/"&gt;move&lt;/a&gt;.
Nejdřív na roční, pak na měsíční předplatné.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vypadá to, že to funguje.
Na starých tarifech už by neměl nikdo být a brzy je úplně smažu ze systému.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Za pár měsíců uvidím, jak moc lidí nakonec odejde a o kolik víc budu vydělávat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi"&gt;Další&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Propagoval jsem v klubu a na Pyvec Slacku možnost dobrovolničení v organizačním týmu PyCon CZ, který se začal sestavovat.
    PyCon CZ bude po covidové odmlce opět v Praze.
    Kdo byste měli zájem pomoct, &lt;a href="https://docs.pyvec.org/operations/support.html#sit-kontaktu"&gt;přidejte se na Slack podle tohoto návodu&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;a href="https://blog.europython.eu/europython-january-2023-newsletter/"&gt;EuroPython&lt;/a&gt; bude mimochodem taky v Praze,
    ale má jiný organizační tým a samozřejmě jiný termín.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Řešil jsem nějaké detaily partnerství s Green Fox Academy.
    Propojil jsem je s Pájou, aby mohli natočit podcast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PayPal zavedl podporu pro &lt;a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/cshelp/article/can-i-have-my-balance-automatically-transferred-to-my-bank-account-help398"&gt;automatický transfer peněz&lt;/a&gt;.
    Chodí mi tam pár korun z Patreonu, tak jsem si to nastavil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nová verze Scrapy &lt;a href="https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/feed-exports.html#feed-uri-params"&gt;změnila některé věci&lt;/a&gt;, tak jsem je opravoval.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zjistil jsem zajímavou věc.
    Kdybych měl dobrá data o pracovních inzerátech pro juniory, minimálně jedna vzdělávací agentura by za ně byla ochotna platit.
    Tohle by mohlo vrátit nabídky práce na JG zase trochu na výsluní mého zájmu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dolaďovali jsme se Zuzanou Pechovou detaily k přednášce, která bude příští týden.
    Pak jsem to &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7026925311933968385?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=member_desktop"&gt;propagoval na LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Propagoval jsem na LinkedIn &lt;a href="https://forms.gle/TNT46oPcS3oZEpeb9"&gt;novou možnost pohovorů nanečisto s Ataccamou&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/crdoconnor/strictyaml/issues/191"&gt;Naučil jsem se&lt;/a&gt; jak ve &lt;code&gt;strictyaml&lt;/code&gt; načítat pouze datum místo data a času.
    Na celém JG jsem to změnil podle toho.
    Funguje to skvěle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Koupil jsem si lístek na letošní &lt;a href="https://na.pycon.org/"&gt;PyCon NA&lt;/a&gt;, ačkoliv tam nepojedu.
    &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/jessica-upani-about-python-events-in-namibia-you-have-to-be-pure-in-terms-of-your-why/"&gt;Jsou úžasní&lt;/a&gt; a chci je podpořit.
    Podpořte je taky, lístek stojí zhruba pětistovku.
    Ty lidi znám osobně a mohu se za ně stoprocentně zaručit.
    Každá koruna jim udělá radost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dostal jsem seriózní nabídku, že by se &lt;a href="https://cojeapi.cz"&gt;cojeapi.cz&lt;/a&gt; mohlo sloučit s &lt;a href="https://naucme.it/"&gt;naucme.it&lt;/a&gt;, spolu s nabídkou odkupu domén.
    Vzal jsem si čas na rozmyšlenou.
    Taky nevím, za kolik bych měl domény cojeapi.cz, jakpsatapi.cz a whatisapi.org prodat.
    Nikdy jsem domény neprodával.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Všiml jsem si, že &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;grafy&lt;/a&gt; ukazují nula lidí na stipendijním předplatném.
    To je blbost, takže jsem hledal chybu.
    Chyba se netýkala jen stipendií.
    Kód, který jsem nedávno upravoval, nyní hodně špatně vyhodnocoval, kdo je na jakém kupónu.
    Měl jsem testy na různé hraniční případy, ale neměl jsem test na základní a zcela běžnou situaci.
    Přesně pro ni se to rozbilo 😀&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Udělil jsem dvě stipendia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odpovídání v klubu, e-maily, &lt;a href="https://docs.pyvec.org/operations/support.html#sit-kontaktu"&gt;Pyvec Slack&lt;/a&gt;, atd.
    Upgradování závislostí na vlastních i Pyvec projektech (zpracovávání Pull Requestů, které průběžně posílá Dependabot).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 8 dní od 27. 1. do 3. 2. jsem při procházkách nachodil 9 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 3 hodiny a zdolal při tom 9 kilometrů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finanční výsledky, návštěvnost a další čísla k JG &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;mám přímo na webu&lt;/a&gt;.
    Aktuální nabídky práce pro juniory: &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/dbbb7bf406b3c33aeba36cae817919d44bfb368a08fb1b4899dba130/"&gt;Processand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/34fa3ec07892dd3ff64458e2ccbf12578e00860483427e9e7c4847bc/"&gt;Red Hat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Udělal jsem něco z &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/strategie-na-2023/"&gt;plánů na rok 2023&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- Koukni sem https://www.icloud.com/notes/092v6QG3aoSmpVOGHnpg0uIXQ --&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rychle se blížím se k vyřešení „Firma musí vědět vše o svém předplatném, v jakém je stavu, kolik čeho zbývá.“&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pomalu se blížím se k vyřešení „Já i firma musíme mít včas informaci, že se blíží konec.“&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Velmi pomalu se blížím k tomu, abych mohl mít na webu ceník pro firmy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Podílím se na anketě mezi juniory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Věnuji se Pyvci jako člen výboru.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nastavím, aby Memberful posílalo lidem e-mail, pokud zruší členství.
    Mělo by v něm být něco o tom, aby zkusili stipendium, pokud je pro ně klub moc drahý.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Budu mít pro každou firmu stránku, na které bude výpis údajů o jejich partnerství.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aktualizuji skript, který vítá firmy v klubu.
    Nově bude odkazovat na ty nové stránky a transparentně informovat o všech závazcích, které k firmě mám.&lt;/li&gt;

Je to chyba nás všech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;„Jak se vám asi tak bude žít v oblasti, kde prakticky nefunguje jediná nemocnice? Kde si pacienty překládají na benzinkách, protože vozů je málo a nemohou opustit hranice okresu? Jakou perspektivu máte, když už od střední školy vás vzdělání připravuje pouze a jenom na realitu špatně placené práce v ekonomice montoven? Jaké to asi je, když za prací nebo za vzděláním dojíždíte, ale kvalita dopravy upadá a jízdné se neustále zdražuje?“ … „Vyfouknout Babišovi roli toho, kdo se stará o lidi, můžeme jen tím, že budeme soustavně upozorňovat na to, s jakými strukturálními problémy se Česko potýká, a žádat jejich řešení tak, aby byl Babiš vždy o několik kroků pozadu.“&lt;/li&gt;

Pěstují zeleninu a chovají slepice — Město&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pustil jsem si k úklidu kuchyně povídání se zahradníkem, že to bude chill na neděli. Dostal jsem rozzlobeného muže rapujícího o nedostatcích veřejného prostoru, o politice, developerech, udržitelnosti. Skvělý to bylo!&lt;/li&gt;

Jazyk nemůže za problémy společnosti.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Opět fajn newsletter, tentokrát o mluveném projevu. Třeba tohle pozoruju od začátku války: „Západní novináři i veřejnost většinou oceňují projevy ukrajinského prezidenta Zelenského, který má ostatně ke skvělé rétorice coby herec z povolání dobré předpoklady. Také hraje na emoce, u západních politiků se snaží vyvolat pocity viny, strach, nebo naopak pošimrat jejich ego, opakuje dokola stejné figury a bonmoty, pracuje se zanícenými morálními apely a expresivním projevem.“ Tohle už TikToková generace dávno ví, ale moje si to potřebuje přečíst: „Efektivní a srozumitelný text vyžaduje propracovanou logickou strukturu, precizní argumenty, bohatou slovní zásobu, věcnost a další vlastnosti, které pak mylně vyžadujeme po ústním projevu. Ten má ale jiné, často zcela protichůdné požadavky.“&lt;/li&gt;

Psaní poznámek mi taky pomáhá nezbláznit se a nepropadat pocitu, že je konec týdne a já jsem nestihl nic udělat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- Honzo, piš jednu větu na řádek! https://sive.rs/1s --&gt;

&lt;h2 id="dovolena-v-jesenikach"&gt;Dovolená v Jeseníkách&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dovolena-v-jesenikach" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minulý týden jsem pracoval jen dva dny a v pátek jsem byl na horách, tak jsem poznámky nepsal.
Do Jeseníků jsme &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/bez-auta/"&gt;jeli vlakem&lt;/a&gt;.
Dítě v nosítku, nějaké ty baťohy a já táhl ještě boby, ale přišlo mi, že se vše odehrálo v dobré náladě a bez stresu.
Jeden přestup v Zábřehu, vlak s bistro vozem, bistro vůz s řízkem a kafíčkem, pohoda.
Dítě už konečně začíná vnímat, co vidí za oknem, tak máme zase novou zábavu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Nádraží Ramzová" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/img-1592.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trochu blbé je, že jsme si z hor odvezli zase nějakou chorobu.
Naštěstí nic vážného.
Kašlíček a rýmička.
I tak už mě to ale unavuje, v podstatě měsíc v kuse nejsem fit.
Smrkání a zalévání coldrexů mi taky bere energii pouštět se do nových věcí.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fora-na-discordu"&gt;Fóra na Discordu&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#fora-na-discordu" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Konečně jsem na to sedl a udělal to.
Přidal jsem do bota podporu pro to, aby uměl číst kanály typu fórum, &lt;a href="https://discord.com/blog/forum-channels-space-for-organized-conversation"&gt;které Discord před časem přidal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když už jsem měnil kód, zkusil jsem bota naučit i nový, pohodlnější způsob načítání klasických vláken.
Tento nový způsob dřív neexistoval, ale &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/py-cord/"&gt;pycord&lt;/a&gt; už nějakou chvíli tyhle věci má.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Při tom jsem zjistil, že nový a starý způsob vrací různý počet vláken.
Nemohl jsem přijít na to proč.
Skončilo to až u toho, že jsem si všechna vlákna nechal vyjet jako CSV a pak použil &lt;a href="https://www.textcompare.org/csv/compare"&gt;tohle&lt;/a&gt; (šikovná věc!), abych je porovnal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zjistil jsem, že někdy lidé založili vlákno, ale pak si to rozmysleli a smazali jeho počáteční zprávu.
Zbytek vlákna však zůstal viset v paměti Discordu jako sirotek.
Starý způsob je nenašel, ale nový tyto sirotky přečte.
Záhada odhalena, vše je v pořádku.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Každopádně jsem tedy do klubu přidal první kanál typu fórum.
Nahradil jsem jím starou poradnu, protože tam to dává největší smysl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Původní poradna" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2023-01-27-at-14-22-24.png" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figure-caption"&gt;
Původní poradna&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Nová poradna" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2023-01-27-at-14-20-21.png" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figure-caption"&gt;
Nová poradna&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Žádné další velké změny jsem nedělal, abych lidi nezahltil, a aby si měli čas prohlédnout, jak fórum funguje a co umí.
Ponoukl jsem členy, aby mi psali nápady, kde všude by se to dalo dále využít.
Strhla se zajímavá debata o tom, jak by šlo přeuspořádat klub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fórum umí i tagovat témata.
Přidával jsem v poradně tagy: Python, JavaScript, Java… ale brzy jsem narazil na strop.
Limit je 20 tagů na fórum, takže s nimi musím šetřit.
Aby tagy co nejvíc kopírovaly dosavadní realitu, vyjel jsem si všechna témata ze staré poradny a očima analyzoval, do jakého tématu zhruba spadají.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Tagy" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2023-01-27-at-14-23-28.png" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Změny jsem pak všude v klubu s velkým jásotem oznámil a starou poradnu archivoval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nastenka-a-prednasky"&gt;Nástěnka a přednášky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#nastenka-a-prednasky" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Přednášek je už tolik, že se nevešly na nástěnku.
Discord má limit znaků na tzv. &lt;em&gt;embed&lt;/em&gt; u příspěvku a ten už přednášky přesáhly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myslel jsem, že bych vytvořil celý nový kanál jen na přednášky.
Nejspíš kanál typu fórum, kde by každé vlákno bylo pro jednu přednášku.
Spravoval by to bot a byl by to takový pěkný archiv záznamů přednášek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pak mi ale došlo, že je to hodně programování, které v &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/strategie-na-2023/"&gt;plánech na rok 2023&lt;/a&gt; nemám.
A že to jde zatím řešit i jednodušeji.
Zaznamenal jsem si to jako nápad a nástěnku jsem upravil tak, aby ukazovala jen posledních deset přednášek.
Nenechal jsem se unést!
Držím směr!
Musím se pochválit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Seznam záznamů přednášek" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2023-01-27-at-14-17-29.png" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figure-caption"&gt;
Na screenshotu je chyba, poslední věta je nalepená na poslední přednášku. Všiml jsem si toho díky psaní těchto poznámek a hned jsem to v kódu opravil.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="discord-server-template"&gt;Discord Server Template&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#discord-server-template" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naučil jsem bota vytvářet a každý den aktualizovat tzv. &lt;em&gt;server template&lt;/em&gt;.
Je to způsob, jak si na Discordu zazálohovat aspoň nastavení serveru, když už nic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bylo to hodně jednoduché na vytvoření.
Ale jak to teď tak píšu, došlo mi, že to má vadu.
Když mi někdo zlikviduje klub, mohlo by se stát, že se pak nad ránem spustí bot a změny automaticky uloží.
Přepíše zálohu.
To budu muset asi ještě promyslet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="podcast"&gt;Podcast&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#podcast" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pavlína vydala novou epizodu &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/podcast/"&gt;podcastu&lt;/a&gt;.
Poslechl jsem si ji a moc se mi líbila.
Na LinkedIn jsem ji ale &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/honzajavorek_feedback-impostorsyndrome-activity-7024349175571980289-PcvL?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=member_desktop"&gt;promoval až včera&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Začínám se s Pavlínou dělit o zisk, který mám díky spolupráci s firmami.
Domluvili jsme se, že mi bude posílat fakturu za každou epizodu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Začneme také označovat epizody, které jsou finančně podpořené spoluprací s firmami.
Zatím takové nebyly, ale budou.
Pozvání do podcastu mám teď normálně v ceníku.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epizodu s Lukášem z Fakturoidu jsme nedělali na základě aktuálního tarifu z ceníku.
Fakturoid si však od začátku existence junior.guru platí nejvyšší tarify a příprava epizody odpovídala spíš spolupráci.
Bude to tedy taková epizoda na pomezí, kterou asi nakonec jako spolupráci označím.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zkusil jsem si do &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/junior.guru/blob/35075510b8555a01f233b43b6f9df20697f1ac21/juniorguru/data/podcast.yml#L26"&gt;podcastového YAMLu přidat údaj o firmě&lt;/a&gt;, ale zatím se to neprojevuje ani na webu, ani v popiscích epizod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="blog"&gt;Blog&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#blog" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Povedlo se mi zjistit, proč mi v GitHub Actions nefungoval &lt;code&gt;PAT&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;em&gt;personal access token&lt;/em&gt;) na to, aby commit zpět do repozitáře udělaný z Actions vyvolal další build.
&lt;a href="https://github.com/EndBug/add-and-commit#the-commit-from-the-action-is-not-triggering-ci"&gt;Podle dokumentace&lt;/a&gt; se musí token nastavit pro &lt;code&gt;actions/checkout@v3&lt;/code&gt;.
To jsem dělal a nefungovalo to.
Teď jsem si všiml, že mám v buildu ten checkout dvakrát!
Jednou na začátku, kam jsem ten PAT dával, ale uprostřed buildu jsem potřeboval resetovat Git, tak jsem tam měl checkout znova a ten jsem úplně přehlédl.
Ten tedy použil zase vestavěný &lt;code&gt;GITHUB_TOKEN&lt;/code&gt;, který nestačí, a proto to celou dobu nefungovalo.
Opraveno, funguje.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když teď napíšu článek a udělám &lt;code&gt;git push&lt;/code&gt; na GitHub, spustí se GitHub Action, která jej publikuje na GitHub Pages, následně vezme odkaz na článek a ten mi pošle soukromou zprávou na Telegram.
To způsobí, že Telegram načte náhledový obrázek.
GitHub Action chvíli počká a pak tentýž odkaz dá do &lt;a href="https://t.me/honzajavorekcz"&gt;mé telegramové skupiny&lt;/a&gt;.
Vezme URL telegramového příspěvku a vepíše jej zpět do zdrojového kódu článku.
Tuto změnu commitne, pushne zpět na GitHub, a tam se opět publikují GitHub Pages.
V této nové verzi už je článek zpětně propojený s telegramovým příspěvkem, takže pod ním jdou načíst komentáře.
Krásné!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co není krásné?
Že mi asi nefunguje ten &lt;a href="http://eepurl.com/ifI06H"&gt;newsletter&lt;/a&gt;.
Zdá se, že ačkoliv jsem minule vydal poznámky, nikomu to nic neposlalo.
Zřejmě není tak snadné udělat si vlastní Substack, jak jsem myslel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ale klidně se tam hlašte.
Ať už to nakonec vyřeším jakkoliv, ten seznam e-mailů použiju a rozesílat to začnu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když jsem psal tyto poznámky a chtěl jsem sem nahrát fotky z hor, zjistil jsem, že můj skript na automatické vcucnutí fotek do Markdownu neumí &lt;code&gt;.HEIC&lt;/code&gt;.
Jakožto Apple ovce mám v &lt;code&gt;.HEIC&lt;/code&gt; všechno, tak jsem přidal do skriptu podporu pro tento formát (použil jsem &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/pillow-heif/"&gt;pillow-heif&lt;/a&gt;) a naučil jej konvertovat takové fotky do &lt;code&gt;.jpg&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="firmy"&gt;Firmy&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#firmy" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S Engetem jsem si měl volat kvůli připravované anketě mezi juniory, ale kvůli různým věcem jsme to několikrát posunuli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poslal jsem mail do dvou vzdělávacích agentur, se kterými jsem dřív komunikoval.
Nastínil jsem jim nový produkt, katalog agentur.
Jedna napsala, že to vypadá dobře, ale že zrovna řeší rozpočet a budoucnost na tento rok a potrvá to, tak se ozve později.
Druhá napsala, že to vypadá dobře a rádi budou spolupracovat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Následně jsem tento týden dotáhl &lt;em&gt;deal&lt;/em&gt; s &lt;a href="https://www.greenfoxacademy.cz/"&gt;Green Fox Academy&lt;/a&gt;, který souvisí s mým novým záměrem dělat v určitých mezích byznys i se vzdělávacími agenturami.
Logo je na webu, faktura poslána!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Green Fox Academy na příručce" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid figure-img rounded" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2023-01-25-at-20-01-24.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figure-caption"&gt;
Green Fox Academy mají nejvyšší tarif, takže je jejich logo i na příručce.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V klubu je bot ještě neuvítal, protože jsem to na chvíli vypnul.
Chci tuto funkčnost zrovna revidovat a vylepšit.
K tomu ale potřebuji dokončenou novou evidenci firem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="evidence-firem"&gt;Evidence firem&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#evidence-firem" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Začal jsem připravovat nový způsob evidence závazků, které mám k firmám.
Jednak moje Excelová tabulka přestává trochu stačit, jednak chci být transparentní i v tomto, především kvůli tomu, aby lidi znali moje závazky se vzdělávacími agenturami a mohli zvážit, jak moc nezávislý jsem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Začal jsem si do YAMLu přepisovat &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/junior.guru/blob/35075510b8555a01f233b43b6f9df20697f1ac21/juniorguru/data/company-plans.yml"&gt;ceník&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/junior.guru/blob/35075510b8555a01f233b43b6f9df20697f1ac21/juniorguru/data/companies.yml"&gt;seznam firem&lt;/a&gt;.
Zatím to není na nic napojené, akorát jsem skriptem ověřil, že údaje o firmách jsou totožné s údaji v Excelu a že jsem se někde při přepisování nespletl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chtěl bych mít stránku pro každou firmu, kde budou informace o tom, co si objednali, co jsme už udělali, co ještě zbývá udělat, kdy končí jejich spolupráce, apod.
Nejspíš to bude někde v rámci &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;/open/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bylo by super, kdybych tam mohl mít i malinkou klientskou sekci, kde by viděli i poslední faktury, nebo by tam měli odkaz, přes který mohou posílat lidi do klubu.
To však nejsou veřejné věci a můj web jsou statické stránky.
Existuje nejspíš hodně složitých způsobů, jak to řešit.
Z těch jednoduchých se mi líbí zatím tři:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zaheslovat to nějak přes &lt;a href="https://dev.to/render/password-protect-static-sites-with-pagecrypt-4dia"&gt;PageCrypt&lt;/a&gt;.
    Má to různé nevýhody, ale nejdůležitější je podle mě z hlediska UX.
    Vůbec nevím, co by mělo být heslo, aby si ho někdo, kdo se mnou v té firmě vyjednává partnerství, pamatoval i za půl roku.
    Údaje jako faktury nebo odkaz do klubu tam chci mít, aby je ti lidi měli po ruce a neptali se mě na to.
    Tohle by jen změnilo jejich dotaz na dotaz ohledně zapomenutého hesla.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poslat jim tyto rozšířené informace mailem.
    E-mail by mohl chodit čtvrtletně, to mi přijde jako rozumná frekvence vzhledem k tomu, že spolupráce s firmami mám roční a naše aktivity mívají spíš pomalejší tempo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Udělat to variantou 2., ale ne teď.
    Nechat to na jindy jako možné vylepšení, protože je to jen blbina navíc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud zjistím, že těm lidem stejně potřebuji něco posílat e-mailem (např. že bude končit spolupráce a měli bychom se bavit o tom, jestli chtějí prodloužit), tak udělám variantu 2.
Jinak 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="audit-vzdelavacich-agentur"&gt;Audit vzdělávacích agentur&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#audit-vzdelavacich-agentur" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volal jsem si se zakladatelem Green Fox Academy a bavili jsme se o katalogu vzdělávacích agentur a o nezávislém auditu bootcampů.
V Maďarsku to &lt;a href="https://ivsz.hu/bootcamp-auditjelentes/"&gt;existuje&lt;/a&gt; a kultivuje to tamní trh vzdělávacích agentur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Přišlo mi, že by to mohl být zajímavý krok, jak vylepšit můj budoucí katalog a jak mu dodat velkou váhu.
Chtělo by to ale spojit se v tomto s nějakou seriózní institucí, které budou ostatní věřit víc, než brýlatému týpkovi s webovkou, která má v názvu „guru“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zkusil jsem hned hodit e-mail do &lt;a href="https://digikoalice.cz/"&gt;DigiKoalice&lt;/a&gt;, když už jsem členem, jestli to není náhodou něco, co by je zajímalo.
Když to bude vlažné, tak zkusím, co by mi poradili v &lt;a href="https://cesko.digital/"&gt;Česko.Digital&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="infrastruktura"&gt;Infrastruktura&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#infrastruktura" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zjistil jsem, že mi na CircleCI nefungují některé věci.
    Bylo to tím, že po jejich &lt;a href="https://circleci.com/blog/jan-4-2023-incident-report/"&gt;nedávném security incidentu&lt;/a&gt; (až by se dalo říct &lt;em&gt;fuckupu&lt;/em&gt;) nejspíš pro jistotu invalidovali všechny svoje tokeny.
    Takže jsem si udělal nové a pak už vše jelo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zjistil jsem, že můj geniální systém na paralelizaci buildu nepočítá s tím, že na CircleCI použiju funkci „restartuj build, ale jen od toho místa, kde to failnulo“.
    Prostudoval jsem ještě jednou &lt;em&gt;environment variables&lt;/em&gt;, které mám k dispozici.
    Místo &lt;code&gt;CIRCLE_WORKFLOW_ID&lt;/code&gt; teď používám &lt;code&gt;CIRCLE_WORKFLOW_WORKSPACE_ID&lt;/code&gt; a zdá se, že to funguje přesně tak, jak potřebuji.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vytvořil jsem si příkaz &lt;code&gt;jg install&lt;/code&gt;, který mi umožní jednoduše při vývoji udělat &lt;code&gt;git pull --rebase origin main&lt;/code&gt;, potom &lt;code&gt;poetry install&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;playwright install&lt;/code&gt; a &lt;code&gt;npm ci&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Všiml jsem si, že &lt;code&gt;playwright install&lt;/code&gt; stahuje tři prohlížeče, ale já používám jen jeden.
    Tak jsem to změnil na &lt;code&gt;playwright install firefox&lt;/code&gt;.
    Díky tomu jsem zjistil, že mi vše spadlo, protože ten jeden prohlížeč, který jsem v kódu používal, bylo ve skutečnosti Chromium.
    Tuto herezi jsem napravil a nyní kód všude používá jediný správný prohlížeč, &lt;a href="https://www.mozilla.org/cs/firefox/new/"&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trochu neplánovaně jsem se pustil do zkoumání, zda a jak obtížné je udělat commit ze CircleCI zpátky na GitHub.
    Pomohlo by mi to s perzistencí některých dat.
    Navíc by to umožňovalo &lt;a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Dec/7/git-history/"&gt;sledovat i historické změny&lt;/a&gt;, pokud bych to potřeboval.
    Četl jsem si &lt;a href="https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018860473-How-to-push-a-commit-back-to-the-same-repository-as-part-of-the-CircleCI-job"&gt;tohle&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://blog.jdblischak.com/posts/circleci-ssh/"&gt;tohle&lt;/a&gt;.
    U toho jsem si uvědomil, že commity ze CircleCI na GitHub už dávno dělám, protože odtamtud dělám deploy na GitHub Pages.
    To není nic jiného, než commit a push do &lt;code&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; větve.
    Na zkoušku jsem naimplementoval automatické formátování kódu pomocí &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/isort/"&gt;isort&lt;/a&gt;.
    Trochu jsem se do toho celého zavrtal a zjednodušil jsem dost věcí v konfiguraci CircleCI.
    Také jsem vyhodil &lt;a href="https://github.com/sugarshin/gh-pages-orb"&gt;CircleCI Orb na GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; a vyměnil jej za léty ověřený &lt;a href="https://github.com/c-w/ghp-import"&gt;ghp-import&lt;/a&gt;.
    Udělal jsem to především proto, že jsem konfiguraci pushování na GitHub &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/junior.guru/blob/03a362774ac174fda226bc138c30f669f35ab1ac/.circleci/config.yml#L16"&gt;sdílel na více místech&lt;/a&gt; a potom už nedávalo moc smysl ten Orb používat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi"&gt;Další&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/crdoconnor/strictyaml/issues/191"&gt;Zeptal jsem se&lt;/a&gt;, jestli můj oblíbený strictyaml umí i něco jako Date, protože častěji potřebuji jen datum, než &lt;a href="https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/using/alpha/scalar/datetime/"&gt;datum a čas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Měli jsme v klubu &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/honzajavorek_datascience-geospatial-geospatialdata-activity-7023236557289488384-8IQr?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=member_desktop"&gt;přednášku s Týnou Doležalovou o Analýze geoprostorových dat, GIS a geospatial data science&lt;/a&gt;.
    Mě se moc líbila a vypadá to, že lidem taky a pouští si ji dost i ze záznamu.
    O vytvoření záznamu se opět postaral Tinuki a stále si strašně užívám, jak jednoduché pro mě teď ty přednášky jsou.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ozval se mi &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefanprokopdev/"&gt;Štefan Prokop&lt;/a&gt; a plánujeme přednášku na téma security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Napadlo mě, že by click mohl umět automaticky generovat tasky pro VS Code.
    Ale možná je to blbost.
    &lt;a href="https://github.com/pallets/click/discussions/2442"&gt;Zeptal jsem se&lt;/a&gt;, jestli je to blbost, nebo jestli to už neexistuje.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stát mi vytvořil třetí datovou schránku.
    Proč musím mít zvlášť schránky jako smrtelník a jako živnostník, to mi fakt uniká.
    Nepřišel jsem na to, jak se mohu mezi svými schránkami přepínat bez toho, abych se musel odhlásit.
    Nainstaloval jsem aplikaci &lt;a href="https://www.datovka.cz/"&gt;Datovka&lt;/a&gt;.
    Jsem rád, že existuje, ale vypadá jak nějaký linuxový e-mailový klient z devadesátek.
    Po otevření na mě vyskočil formulář s dvaceti políčky.
    Pro vyplnění bych potřeboval návod, takže jsem aplikaci zase zavřel.
    Nastavím ji a využiju až pokud mi bude chodit pět zpráv do datovky týdně.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bavil jsem se s Memberful supportem.
    Jako obvykle skvělá zkušenost.
    Zajímalo mě, jak přesně funguje funkce na &lt;a href="https://memberful.com/help/manage-your-members/move-all-members-of-a-plan/"&gt;přesunutí lidí mezi tarify&lt;/a&gt;.
    Pak jsem chtěl vědět, zda mohu přes API vytahovat informace o &lt;em&gt;custom fields&lt;/em&gt; (kde lidi narazili na junior.guru) a &lt;em&gt;cancellation surveys&lt;/em&gt; (proč ruší předplatné), abych to mohl analyzovat, nebo si to někam posílal.
    Zatím to nejde.
    Custom fields &lt;a href="https://memberful.com/help/customize/create-custom-fields/#can-custom-field-data-be-accessed-outside-the-memberful-dashboard"&gt;jen přes nějaké webhooky&lt;/a&gt;.
    Cancellations však mohou odesílat automatický e-mail, kde mohu lidem něco napsat.
    Chtěl bych to využít k tomu, že když někdo zruší předplatné kvůli penězům, v tomto e-mailu bych nabídl, ať zkusí stipendium.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prdla nám žárovka v digestoři, tak jsem koupil novou.
    Při té příležitosti jsem koupil i nové filtry.
    Dnes jsem to vyměňoval a zevnitř jsem to i trochu očistil.
    Překvapilo mě, že vnitřek digestoře není ve skutečnosti žlutý, ale bílý.
    Jedna z nevýhod bydlení v nájmu je, že pokud děláte nějakou údržbu spotřebičů, nejspíš jste první člověk v historii bytu, který se do toho pustil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nainstaloval jsem si konečně na počítač osmou verzi 1Password.
    Zaujala mě pak novinka, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aT4K1AMfGI"&gt;použití 1Password pro CLI nástroje&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Šel jsem volit.
    Nepotřeboval jsem se tentokrát o ničem rozhodovat, takže jsem v rámci zachování duševního zdraví vynechal všechny články a debaty na téma prezidentských voleb.
    Podle zoufání kamarádů, kteří se neubránili, to považuji za výborné rozhodnutí.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odpovídání v klubu, e-maily, &lt;a href="https://docs.pyvec.org/operations/support.html#sit-kontaktu"&gt;Pyvec Slack&lt;/a&gt;, atd.
    Upgradování závislostí na vlastních i Pyvec projektech (zpracovávání Pull Requestů, které průběžně posílá Dependabot).
    První týden jsem doháněl e-maily ještě z Vánoc, potom se to už trochu uklidnilo.
    V klubu jsme řešili spoustu věcí, takže tam jsem strávil fakt hodně času.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 15 dní od 13. 1. do 27. 1. jsem při procházkách nachodil 5 km, na túrách nachodil 13 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 8 hodin a zdolal při tom 18 kilometrů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finanční výsledky, návštěvnost a další čísla k JG &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;mám přímo na webu&lt;/a&gt;.
    Aktuální nabídky práce pro juniory: &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/dbbb7bf406b3c33aeba36cae817919d44bfb368a08fb1b4899dba130/"&gt;Processand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/215426887eaaad9105ecf647d0ff24cf94de7c9eb47cc6f2c55e6921/"&gt;Red Hat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="povedlo-se"&gt;Povedlo se&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#povedlo-se" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Udělal jsem něco z &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/strategie-na-2023/"&gt;plánů na rok 2023&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přidal jsem úplně základní podporu pro forum kanály a pozoruji, jak to lidi používají.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Komunikoval jsem se vzdělávacími agenturami a zjišťoval zájem o MVP katalogu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Udělal jsem kroky, které mi umožní mít ceník přímo na webu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Udělal jsem kroky, které mi umožní mít na webu přehled spolupráce s firmami: „Firma musí vědět vše o svém předplatném, v jakém je stavu, kolik čeho zbývá. Já i firma musíme mít včas informaci, že se blíží konec.“&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Udělal jsem kroky, které mi umožní označovat epizody, které jsou finančně podpořené spoluprací s firmami.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Začnu se s Pavlínou dělit o zisk, který mám díky spolupráci s firmami.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Měl jsem dovolenou. Byla ale krátká a chodil jsem během ní občas do klubu.
    Ve strategii jsem si nařídil delší dovolené.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pokročím ve zpracování evidence spolupráce s firmami a nechám bota uvítat Green Fox Academy v klubu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Projdu všechny kupóny na Memberful a upravím je, aby šly použít na nové tarify.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pořádek v Trellu.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Když na něco narazím a líbí se mi to, sdílím to &lt;a href="https://t.me/honzajavorekcz"&gt;na Telegramu&lt;/a&gt;.
Od posledních poznámek jsem sdílel toto:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://genders.wtf/"&gt;Genders.WTF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lidi, kteří tvoří formuláře, zjevně opravdu zápasí s dotazem na gender&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://almad.blog/essays/programming-fast-and-slow/"&gt;Programming, Fast and Slow | Almad's Changelog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Po čase jsem si to znova přečetl a nemohu než souhlasit. Na základě zkušeností z práce, hobby projektů a komunitních projektů: Vidím to úplně stejně.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://tegowerk.eu/posts/cruel-optimism/"&gt;Cruel optimism (and lazy pessimism)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;„Cruel optimism boils down to the folly of suggesting personal solutions to systemic problems. It’s about advice given from a position of privilege to people who will never be able to apply it to their own lives–because the cards are stacked so unfairly against them–but who will nonetheless interpret their failure as a personal one“&lt;/li&gt;

Psaní poznámek mi taky pomáhá nezbláznit se a nepropadat pocitu, že je konec týdne a já jsem nestihl nic udělat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nejdřív onemocněl zbytek rodiny, pak došlo i na mě.
Poznamenalo to celé moje Vánoce a až tento týden jsem dobral antibiotika.
Začalo to jako viróza, pak se to chovalo jako zánět dutin a skončilo to jako zánět průdušek.
Některé dny jsem celé nehybně proležel, takže na konci poznámek najdete nezvykle hodně přečtených článků.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="strategie"&gt;Strategie&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#strategie" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V první části nemoci, která nebyla tak hrozná, jsem sepsal &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/strategie-na-2023/"&gt;strategii na rok 2023&lt;/a&gt;.
Mělo to být pár odrážek, ale dopadlo to jako vždycky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V souvislosti s tím jsem si dělal povrchní úklid v Trellu.
Měl bych to však ještě dotáhnout a Trello vyvětrat pořádně.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upravy-na-blogu"&gt;Úpravy na blogu&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#upravy-na-blogu" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ve volných chvílích jsem se mazlil tady s blogem.
Netušil jsem, kolik práce dá &lt;a href="https://dev.to/masakudamatsu/favicon-nightmare-how-to-maintain-sanity-3al7"&gt;udělat nový favicon&lt;/a&gt;, ale budiž.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Nový favicon" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2023-01-14-at-13-47-00.png" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figure-caption"&gt;
Rozdíl v kvalitě faviconu junior.guru a mé webovky je teď propastný!&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub mi odmítá spouštět actions u commitů poslaných z actions.
Takže když se přidá odkaz na Telegram a commitne zpátky do repa, nedeployne se blog.
To by měl řešit &lt;a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic"&gt;PAT&lt;/a&gt;, ale nefunguje mi to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taky se mi nezobrazuje náhled článků, které dám do &lt;a href="https://t.me/honzajavorekcz"&gt;své Telegramové skupiny&lt;/a&gt; přes bota.
Nezjistil jsem, jak to řešit.
Mohu to ručně poslat na &lt;a href="https://t.me/WebpageBot"&gt;@WebpageBot&lt;/a&gt;, ale to není to, co si představuji pod slovem &lt;em&gt;automatizace&lt;/em&gt;.
Bot nemůže psát jinému botovi, takže ten to neudělá.
Zkouším trik, že by to bot nejdřív poslal do soukromé zprávy mě a až za několik sekund do skupiny.
Zda to funguje, zjistím, až vydám tento článek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Povedlo se mi díky supportu MailChimpu &lt;a href="https://us14.admin.mailchimp.com/customer-journey/#/create-campaign/explore/emailCampaign:custom"&gt;vytvořit RSS kampaň&lt;/a&gt;.
S pomocí &lt;a href="https://mailchimp.com/help/rss-merge-tags/"&gt;merge tags&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://mailchimp.com/help/share-your-blog-posts-with-mailchimp/"&gt;různých návodů&lt;/a&gt; se mi povedlo něco nastavit.
Formulář jsem chtěl mít v češtině, ale MailChimp tam má jen nějaký hrozný automatický překlad, tak jsem si to &lt;a href="https://mailchimp.com/help/translate-signup-forms-and-emails/"&gt;přeložil ručně&lt;/a&gt;.
Přihlásit k odběru se můžete tlačítkem nahoře na &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/"&gt;úvodní stránce blogu&lt;/a&gt;.
Udělalo to už 15 lidí.
Je to zatím pouze pokus, tak jsem to moc nepropagoval.
Zda a jak to funguje, zjistím, až vydám tento článek.
Celé mi to taky pomůže do budoucna vymyslet newsletter pro junior.guru.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zdrazeni"&gt;Zdražení&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#zdrazeni" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chtěl jsem do konce roku zdražit klub členům, aby lednový nápor už proběhl za nové ceny.
Nakonec jsem to dělal na poslední chvíli, když mi zrovna bylo chvíli líp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vybral jsem cenu &lt;strong&gt;199 Kč měsíčně&lt;/strong&gt;.
K tomu, abych šel s novou cenou na vrchní hranici zvažovaného rozsahu, mě motivovali sami členové.
Udělal jsem si aspoň základní propočty.
Protože zdražuji v podstatě na dvojnásobek, musela by odejít polovina členů, aby se mi to nevyplatilo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Někdo mi chtěl v minulosti platit víc než kolik stálo členství, protože mě chtěl podpořit.
Experimentuji tedy s tím, že lidi s měsíční platbou &lt;a href="https://memberful.com/help/plans-and-products/enable-choose-what-to-pay/"&gt;mohou zadat i vyšší číslo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vše jsem diskutoval v klubu a také jsem všem členům poslal e-mail, kde jsem se snažil změnu vysvětlit.
Stávající členové mají možnost koupit si roční členství za původní cenu.
Starou cenu mají i na měsíčním členství, a to do února, kdy je převedu na nové tarify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na Silvestra jsem na webu změnil ceny, některé texty, odkazy.
Přečetl jsem si pro jistotu obchodní podmínky apod. stránky na webu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Nové ceny" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid figure-img rounded" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2023-01-14-at-13-48-18-klub-pro-zacatecniky-v-programovani.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hodně jsem studoval dokumentaci Memberful, třeba &lt;a href="https://memberful.com/help/plans-and-products/change-plan-price/"&gt;změnu ceny&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://memberful.com/help/plans-and-products/configure-upgrade-settings/"&gt;upgrady&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://memberful.com/help/manage-your-members/give-free-access/"&gt;přístup zdarma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://memberful.com/help/manage-your-members/move-all-members-of-a-plan/"&gt;hromadné přesunování lidí mezi tarify&lt;/a&gt;.
Doteď si nejsem jistý, zda při přesunu lidi nepřijdou o kupóny.
To by byl pro mě dost problém.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Napadlo mě, jestli by nešlo stipendium kompletně převést z Google formuláře pod Memberful.
Bohužel &lt;a href="https://memberful.com/help/customize/create-custom-fields/"&gt;custom fields&lt;/a&gt; jsou pro všechny tarify totožné, nelze udělat jinou sadu otázek pro speciální tarif.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chvíli jsem se snažil stipendium do toho formuláře na Memberful nacpat, než jsem zjistil, že je to hloupost.
Díky tomu jsem aspoň všechny texty a otázky ve stipendiu zkrátil a zjednodušil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Také jsem aspoň přidal ke všem tarifům dotaz na to, kde lidi přišli na junior.guru.
Skvělé je, že se to lidem objeví k vyplnění hned po registraci, takže si to nejspíš budou ještě pamatovat.
Je to otevřená otázka, což znesnadní zpracování, ale umožní to lidem napsat věci svými slovy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Otázka po registraci" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid figure-img rounded" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2023-01-14-at-13-49-35-customize-custom-fields.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Udělal jsem úklid v kupónech a pročistil lidi, kteří měli vstup zdarma díky podpoře přes GitHub nebo Patreon, ale kteří mě tam již nepodporují.
Zrušil jsem kupóny firem, které neprodloužily partnerství.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jak-lidi-nachazeji-juniorguru"&gt;Jak lidi nacházejí junior.guru&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#jak-lidi-nachazeji-juniorguru" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Než jsem přidal otázku po registraci, která u nových lidí zjišťuje, kde našli junior.guru, zkusil jsem v klubu udělat jednoduchou anketu.
Výsledky mě překvapily, jelikož úplně nekopírují moje dojmy, na kterých jsem založil svou novou &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/moje-nova-strategie-na-socialni-site/"&gt;strategii na marketing&lt;/a&gt; 😀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Anketa" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2023-01-14-at-13-58-16.png" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Výsledky ankety ale nelze číst přímočaře.
Jednak odpovídali lidi, kteří v klubu už jsou, a to třeba i déle než rok.
Někdy si ani nepamatují, jak to přesně bylo.
Moje strategie tehdy a dnes se dost liší.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Také mi nikdo neřekne, že junior.guru objevil přes newsletter nebo Q&amp;amp;A, když newsletter nemám a Q&amp;amp;A nedělám.
Dokud to nevyzkouším, tak nezjistím, zda to nahradí nebo překoná Twitter či Instagram.
LinkedIn tam vychází slabší než ostatní sítě, ale zase nehlasovalo tolik lidí, abych mohl něco vyvozovat z rozdílu dvou hlasů.
Na své strategii tedy měnit zatím nic nebudu a nechám se překvapit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Že mě nejvíc lidí našlo přes příručku, potvrzuje, že bych se měl soustředit na SEO a Google.
Čekal jsem však, že bude v klubu mnohem víc těch, kdo mě našli přes hledání kurzů nebo inzerátů práce.
Stránky kurzů mají dlouhodobě velkou hledanost i návštěvnost a pamatuji si nové členy, kteří přes ně jednoznačně přišli.
Je možné, že sice přišli, ale nezůstali?
Mohlo by to znamenat, že na kurzy sice chodí hodně lidí, ale není to pro klub kvalitní návštěvnost ke konverzi.
Ovlivní to nějak můj nový produkt, katalog kurzů?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zajímavé také je, že lidé chodí hodně přes podcasty, ale ne ty naše 😀
Pamatoval jsem si, že hodně lidí zmínilo, že přišlo „přes podcast“ a já automaticky předpokládal, že přes náš.
Z ankety to spíš vypadá, že dobře funguje, když se nechám pozvat do jiných podcastů, ale nejspíš není mnoho lidí, kteří junior.guru našli přes junior.guru podcast.
Mám tedy v roce 2023 do našeho podcastu investovat tolik energie, kolik jsem si naplánoval?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A překvapilo mě, kolik lidí mě objevilo díky &lt;a href="https://robweb.sk"&gt;yablkovi&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="grafy"&gt;Grafy&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#grafy" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mojí již tradiční vánoční kratochvílí je vylepšování &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;stránky s čísly a grafy&lt;/a&gt;.
Když mi zrovna bylo lépe, hrál jsem si s barvičkami, upravoval texty, vylepšoval zobrazení.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V souvislosti s novými finančními cíli jsem změnil &lt;em&gt;progress bar&lt;/em&gt; na tabulku se smajlíky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Udělal jsem grafy &lt;a href="https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/configuration/responsive.html"&gt;responzivnější&lt;/a&gt;, aby se daly číst i na mobilu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Našel jsem zajímavou knihovnu &lt;a href="https://chartjs-plugin-datalabels.netlify.app/samples/charts/line.html"&gt;chartjs-plugin-datalabels&lt;/a&gt;, ale nakonec jsem ji nepoužil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Použil jsem &lt;a href="https://www.chartjs.org/chartjs-plugin-annotation/latest/guide/types/box.html"&gt;chartjs-plugin-annotation&lt;/a&gt;.
    Umožnilo mi to na grafy přidat svislé čáry pro různé milníky v historii junior.guru.
    A přidal jsem i čárkované označující přelomy let.
    Dalo to nečekaně dost práce, hlavně umístění popisků a volba barev, aby to nebyl úplný chaos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do grafu &lt;strong&gt;Členství v klubu&lt;/strong&gt; jsem přidal počet ročních individuálně placených předplatných.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přidal jsem sekci &lt;strong&gt;Aktivita v klubu&lt;/strong&gt;, kde je graf počtu příspěvků v klubu a počet online akcí v klubu.
    První mi pomůže sledovat, zda klub žije méně nebo více.
    Druhý mi umožní hlídat, zda plním svůj cíl zajistit v průměru dvě oficiální akce měsíčně.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Předělal jsem, jak se odhaduje počet žen v klubu.
    Místo pevného seznamu křestních jmen si nyní bot stahuje &lt;a href="https://github.com/5j9/wikitextparser%20a%20https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seznam_nej%C4%8Dast%C4%9Bj%C5%A1%C3%ADch_%C5%BEensk%C3%BDch_jmen_v_%C4%8Cesku"&gt;tabulku z Wikipedie&lt;/a&gt;.
    Graf podílu žen v klubu jsem už měl, ale přidal jsem graf podílu žen mezi přednášejícími na oficiálních akcích.
    Umožní mi to hlídat, zda mám za posledních 12 měsíců 50% podíl žen mezi přednášejícími, nebo je to jinak.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;S novou verzí chart.js jsem objevil chybu v annotation pluginu a &lt;a href="https://github.com/chartjs/chartjs-plugin-annotation/issues/831"&gt;založil jsem issue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přidal jsem do grafů barvičky pro výdaje spojené s produkcí video záznamů.
    Také jsem do samostatné barvy vyčlenil lidi, kteří mají vstup do klubu zdarma díky tomu, že mi pomáhají.
    Například &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/podcast/"&gt;Pavlína&lt;/a&gt;, moderátoři, atd.
    Nazval jsem to „tým junior.guru“.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Náklady" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid figure-img rounded" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2023-01-14-at-15-45-16.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="discord-a-memberful"&gt;Discord a Memberful&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#discord-a-memberful" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discord už dlouho umožňuje propojit svůj účet s účty na jiných službách, ale nyní to vylepšují a &lt;a href="https://discord.com/build/linked-roles"&gt;lákají na to platformy&lt;/a&gt;.
    Většinou jde o hry, hudbu, apod.
    Mohu např. nastavit, že kdo má nějaké úspěchy při hraní Diabla, bude mít na mém serveru automaticky nějakou roli.
    Dovedu si představit, že pro hry je to hodně dobré, ale zatím nevím, jak bych to využil.
    Připojit jde GitHub, tak jsem na zkoušku udělal roli pro ty, kdo si profil propojili, ale nedá se tam využít žádná další data, např. dát speciální roli někomu, kdo má aspoň 3 repozitáře.
    LinkedIn propojit nejde.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Našel jsem další a další nedokonalosti v tom, jak fungují tipy pro nové členy v klubu.
    Ať už technického rázu, nebo co se týče uživatelské použitelnosti.
    Přemýšlel jsem jak to napsat, ale napíšu to stručně:
    Ty tipy už mě serou.
    Musím vymyslet, co s nimi, rychle to udělat a posunout se na další věci.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do budoucna jsem uvažoval o tom, že kdo by do klubu doporučil nového člena, dostal by nějakou výhodu.
    Jedna možnost je sleva, jiná možnost je dárek.
    Slevy jednak dávat nechci, jednak by se to bilo s mojím systémem kupónů, takže i když &lt;a href="https://memberful.com/help/analytics-and-tracking/track-member-referrals/"&gt;to má přímo Memberful&lt;/a&gt;, nemohu to snadno použít.
    Napadlo mě, že jako dárek by se dalo tomu člověku zaplatit &lt;a href="https://discord.com/nitro"&gt;Discord Nitro&lt;/a&gt;.
    Je to ale dost drahé, takže maximálně tak na měsíc 😬&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memberful přidal a hned všem zapnul tzv. &lt;a href="https://memberful.com/product-updates/cancellation-survey/"&gt;cancellation surveys&lt;/a&gt;.
    Když někdo ruší předplatné, hned se jich ptá, proč to dělají.
    Možnosti odpovědí nemohu měnit, ale lepší bych stejně nevymyslel.
    V administraci mám pak statistiku.
    Díky tomu jsem už zahlédl hned dva lidi, kteří zrušili členství kvůli tomu, že je drahé, a mohl jsem je kontaktovat a doptat se jich na další informace.
    Dovedu si představit, že časem napíšu automatizaci, která mi ty zajímavější odcházející klienty pošle na Discord do privátního kanálu, kde se o tom hned dovím.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hry"&gt;Hry&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#hry" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když mi bylo líp, dostal jsem chuť zahrát si hru.
Zkusil jsem přes PlayOnMac nainstalovat na tisící pokus svou starou oblíbenou hru &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH4U0EEczFg"&gt;Original War&lt;/a&gt;, ale opět se mi nepovedlo to dotáhnout.
Pak jsem zkoušel přes &lt;code&gt;brew install widelands --cask&lt;/code&gt; nainstalovat Widelands, ale několikrát se to nepovedlo.
Nainstaloval jsem to ručně a jelo to, ale už během tutoriálu mi to několikrát náhodně spadlo, tak jsem to vzdal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dostal jsem chuť na novou hru.
Nejlépe něco, co má příběh a bude to víc jako film a míň jako sto let stará RTS, kde něco buduju.
Půl dne jsem koukal na upoutávky ke hrám.
Prošel jsem si pár seznamů nejlepších her, které jedou na macOS a pár věcí mě zaujalo:
Life is Strange, Knights of the Old Republic, Company of Heroes, Hitman, Cities: Skylines, Cuphead, The Elder Scrolls, Hollow Knight, Her Story, Rise of the Tomb Raider, Kingdoms and Castles, Old World, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Timberborn, Hades, Crusader Kings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Life is Strange" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/capsule_616x353.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nakonec jsem si na hodinu zahrál Life is Strange a strašně mě to bavilo.
Dokonce jsem kvůli tomu i vyhrabal a zapojil myš!
Ale druhý den už jsem začal pracovat a od té doby jsem si to neotevřel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="objevy"&gt;Objevy&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#objevy" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prošel jsem si služby, které při podnikání využívám (např. Memberful, Fakturoid…).
    Pro každou jsem našel jejich produktový blog s novinkami a ten jsem si přidal do RSS čtečky.
    Už jsem díky tomu objevil hromadu zajímavých funkcí.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poslouchal jsem &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcI7HDqErtQ"&gt;Změny a strategie Czechitas 2023&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hledal jsem, zda existuje doplněk do MkDocs, který by z emoji udělal obrázky, které se všude zobrazí stejně.
    Nakonec jsem se &lt;a href="https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/discussions/3082"&gt;zeptal&lt;/a&gt;.
    Díky tomu jsem objevil &lt;a href="https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/"&gt;pymdown-extensions&lt;/a&gt;, což je sada doplňků pro Markdown, která vypadá fakt nabušeně!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kamarádi z Afriky sepisovali články o tom, jak se jim líbilo v Praze:
    &lt;a href="https://ngazetungue.hashnode.dev/my-time-in-prague-for-the-ubuntu-summit-2022"&gt;Ngazetungue Muheue&lt;/a&gt;,
    &lt;a href="https://mesrenyamedogbe.hashnode.dev/my-experience-at-the-ubuntu-summit-2022"&gt;Abigail Mesrenyame Dogbe&lt;/a&gt;.
    Co mě zaujalo?
    Slovo &lt;em&gt;hashnode&lt;/em&gt; v adrese obou těch blogů.
    Možná jsem poslední člověk na světě, který to objevil, ale vůbec jsem nevěděl, že něco jako &lt;a href="https://hashnode.com/"&gt;Hashnode&lt;/a&gt; existuje!
    Hned jsem to prozkoumal a vypadá to jako zajímavá platforma na technicky zaměřené blogísky a nejen to.
    Znali jste to?
    Používá to někdo v Česku?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Několikrát mi lidi doporučovali knihu &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37570605-company-of-one"&gt;Company of One&lt;/a&gt;.
    O Vánocích jsem ji už málem koupil, ale pak jsem si přečetl recenze a pochopil jsem, že mě osobně by nejspíš vůbec nic nedala.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Abych dokázal dobře rozjet newsletter, začal jsem to trochu studovat.
    Přidal jsem si do RSS čtečky &lt;a href="https://newslettery.cz/"&gt;newslettery.cz&lt;/a&gt; a celé jsem to sjel i s podcastem.
    Pak jsem objevil Tvůrcast a až po pár dílech mi došlo, že &lt;a href="https://navolnenoze.cz/novinky/tvurcast/"&gt;to má stejného autora&lt;/a&gt; 😀&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="brachova-prednaska-v-klubu"&gt;Bráchova přednáška v klubu&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#brachova-prednaska-v-klubu" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Před časem se mi brácha, analytik v bance, nabídl, že juniorům v klubu odpřednáší o této své profesi.
Přišlo mi to jako super nápad a 10.1. přednáška v klubu proběhla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opět mi záznam zajišťoval pomocník Tinuki a bylo to úžasné.
Opravdu si užívám, že mohu jen moderovat a nemusím řešit streamování a záznam.
Na jednotlivé přednášky jsem se začal zase těšit, stres úplně zmizel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bráchu jsem před přednáškou trochu víc než obvykle promoval v klubu i &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7018240804745789440/"&gt;na LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;.
Myslím, že to lidi trochu vyhajpovalo a došli v hojném počtu.
Nebo se jenom chtěli podívat, jak vypadají dva Javorci vedle sebe.
Přednáška se protáhla na dvě hodiny, ale měla úspěch a já z ní mám velkou radost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="brácha" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid figure-img rounded" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/1673278998985.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Po přednášce mi spadl CircleCI build, protože seznam záznamů klubových akcí přesáhl limity Discord zpráv na počet písmenek.
To jsem nečekal, i když zpětně je logické, že jednou to přijít muselo.
Jako hotfix jsem &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/junior.guru/commit/12e5f192c536ad6d3b556dda28fab24a1794a894"&gt;zakomentoval pár starých, méně významných akcí&lt;/a&gt;.
Musím ale vymyslet úplně nový způsob, jak budu lidem v klubu záznamy zpřístupňovat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="moderatori"&gt;Moderátoři&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#moderatori" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ve své strategii jsem měl úkol, že v roce 2023 seženu dalšího moderátora.
Zavedl jsem na to řeč v klubu a někdo se mi dokonce i sám přihlásil!
Někoho jsem ještě ukecal a bylo to.
Ani jsem nevěděl jak, najednou je nás moderátorů šest, včetně mně.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Se dvěma z nich, které jsem neznal osobně, jsem si dal krátký seznamovací call.
Musel jsem čistit kanály nebo měnit role v klubu.
Předtím totiž role moderátorů znamenala „jsem jedním ze dvou bohů”, zatímco teď má znamenat „mám oprávnění dělat v klubu o pár věcí víc než ostatní“.
Dva dny jsem opravoval bota, aby se změnami vypořádal a nepředpokládal, že každý moderátor chce například vidět všech 300 kanálů s tipy pro nové členy v klubu, nebo touží aktivně vítat každého nováčka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuto roli jsem zcela oddělil a umožnil lidem, aby si sami zaklikli, že budou „Vítací typ“.
Bot je pak bude automaticky přidávat do vláken, kde vítáme nové členy.
Roli může mít kdokoliv a je samoobslužná, takže koho to už nebude bavit, odklikne se z toho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Všem moderátorům jsem změnil předplatné tak, aby měli klub zdarma.
To vyústilo v nějaké proplácení peněz zpět na jejich kartu (nevyužité měsíce), nebo v to, že jsem je změnami omylem vyhodil z klubu, či vytvořil kombinaci předplatných, se kterou bot vůbec nepočítal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Díky &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/108xe9e/had_a_moderator_invite_a_bot_to_the_server_which/"&gt;jednomu náhodnému postu na Redditu&lt;/a&gt; jsem si uvědomil, že s vyšším počtem moderátorů vzniká větší prostor pro &lt;em&gt;attack vector&lt;/em&gt; nebo lidskou chybu.
V komentářích doporučovali zálohovat klub pomocí &lt;a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041033511-Server-Templates"&gt;server templates&lt;/a&gt;, což jsem doteď neznal a nikdy nepoužil.
Měl bych bota naučit, aby začal dělat aspoň takovéhle snapshoty klubu.
Snad to &lt;a href="https://docs.pycord.dev/en/stable/api/models.html#discord.Template"&gt;nějak půjde&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi"&gt;Další&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;S jednou firmou plánujeme udělat anketu mezi juniory.
    Ptal jsem se lidí v klubu na co se máme ptát a měl jsem k tomu už dva celkem produktivní meetingy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sdílel jsem svou strategii na rok 2023 &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7014987059060690944/"&gt;na LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; a pak tam vedl diskuze o tom, jestli je to vůbec strategie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Založil jsem skupinu na Telegramu, kde se o podnikání radím s dalšími dvěma kamarády podnikajícími v podstatě nebo úplně sólo.
    Čekám od toho, že se budeme motivovat, radit si, a tak.
    Pokud už něco podobného v Česku existuje, dejte mi vědět, ale já našel jen zahraniční, nebo pro jiný typ lidí.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/club/"&gt;stránce klubu&lt;/a&gt; je vždy náhodně pár upoutávek na přednášky.
    Všiml jsem si, že se zobrazují přednášky z budoucnosti, nebo akce, které byly spíš vedlejšími akcemi než přednáškami, na něž bych chtěl někoho lákat.
    Upravil jsem výpis tak, aby promoval jen to, co dává trochu smysl.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obíhal jsem obchody, chodil pro balíky, odesílal dopisy.
    Slavil jsem Vánoce.
    Dostal jsem &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7012387898507296768/"&gt;dárek od STRV&lt;/a&gt;.
    Viděl jsem nějaké pohádky.
    Byli jsme se ženou v divadle na &lt;a href="https://divadlozlin.cz/predstaveni/valka-roseovych-nebude/"&gt;Válka Roseových nebude!&lt;/a&gt;, zatímco babička hlídala dítě.
    Nový rok jsem spíš promarodil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prosincové &lt;a href="https://pyvo.cz/praha-pyvo/"&gt;Pyvo&lt;/a&gt; bylo v době, kdy už byla rodina nemocná.
    Rozhodl jsem se tam nejít, ač mě to mrzelo.
    Bylo to dobré rozhodnutí, akorát bych to roznesl.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přemýšlel jsem, koho volit, ale zároveň jsem se snažil co nejvíc vyhýbat veškerému cirkusu spojenému s prezidentskou volbou.
    Rozhodování bylo těžké a nakonec jsem si tak trochu hodil korunou.
    Druhé kolo bude snad jednodušší.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Napadlo mě, že ač jsem se vždy bránil provozovat v souvislosti s junior.guru cokoliv kontinuálně běžícího, na některé věci by to bylo bez rizika.
    Mohl bych mít někde jednoduchou appku, která by fungovala jako „bezstavový“ bot bez databáze.
    Kdyby spadnul, nic by se velmi nestalo, ale kdyby zrovna jel, zrychloval by u některých věcí odezvu bota v klubu, která je standardně „do 24 hodin“.
    Například vlákna pro nově příchozí by mohl zakládat hned, k tomu žádnou perzistenci nad rámec samotného Discordu nepotřebuje.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Četl jsem &lt;a href="https://www.oliverburkeman.com/books"&gt;Four Thousand Weeks&lt;/a&gt;, ale stále jsem to ještě nedočetl.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Propagoval jsem &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/podcast/"&gt;junior.guru podcast s Lukášem Konarovským z Fakturoidu&lt;/a&gt;.
    Hlavně &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7011717833013231616/"&gt;na LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;.
    Pomohl jsem Pavlíně kontaktovat budoucí hosty.
    Bavili jsme se i o budoucnosti podcastu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stát nám automaticky vytvořil datovou schránku pro Pyvec, z.s.
    Tak dík, no.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na Facebooku se objevila &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/917615511634078/posts/5943298875732358/?comment_id=5943385505723695&amp;amp;reply_comment_id=5945008632228049"&gt;kritika klubu&lt;/a&gt;.
    Členové mě na to upozornili, tak jsem tam šel a vyjádřil jsem se k tomu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Založil jsem support ticket na &lt;a href="https://benevity.com/"&gt;Benevity&lt;/a&gt;, aby opravili starý název Pyvec, o.s. na Pyvec, z.s.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doporučil jsem &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dolejsovajana/"&gt;Janu Dolejšovou&lt;/a&gt; na LinkedIn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odpovídání v klubu, e-maily, &lt;a href="https://docs.pyvec.org/operations/support.html#sit-kontaktu"&gt;Pyvec Slack&lt;/a&gt;, atd.
    Upgradování závislostí na vlastních i Pyvec projektech (zpracovávání Pull Requestů, které průběžně posílá Dependabot).
    Po nemoci jsem doháněl, co jsem zmeškal a stále mám zhruba 20 nevyřešených záležitostí v e-mailu.
    Celkem hodně lidí mi v poslední době psalo ohledně toho, že se jim nedařilo dostat do klubu nebo kvůli jinému chaosu v účtech, tarifech, placení, apod.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Klukům ze svého „běžeckého klubu“ jsem napsal své cíle na letošek:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Běhat pravidelně,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;zaběhnout aspoň 2x do roka 20 km,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;zaběhnout lepší výsledek v Kozojedech (10 km) a účastnit se aspoň zase Blanska (20 km).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;První cíl bude obtížný dost, takže nemá smysl mířit výš.
Kdybych se napodzim moc šťoural v nose, lákalo by mě &lt;a href="https://www.5bv.cz/"&gt;5BV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Během 29 dní od 16. 12. do 13. 1. jsem při procházkách nachodil 3 km.
    Celkem jsem se hýbal 1 hodin a zdolal při tom 3 kilometry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finanční výsledky, návštěvnost a další čísla k JG &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;mám přímo na webu&lt;/a&gt;.
    Aktuální nabídky práce pro juniory: &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/b264ff2a02a50256a3f79075aa5392af08439d165e138ee99ef2df47/"&gt;FYZIOklinika&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/dbbb7bf406b3c33aeba36cae817919d44bfb368a08fb1b4899dba130/"&gt;Processand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/215426887eaaad9105ecf647d0ff24cf94de7c9eb47cc6f2c55e6921/"&gt;Red Hat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Udělal jsem něco z &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/strategie-na-2023/"&gt;plánů na rok 2023&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;strong&gt;ANO!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zrealizoval jsem nejjednodušší možný způsob, jak zjišťovat, odkud do klubu přišli lidi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rozjel jsem newsletter, díky kterému lze odebírat tento blog e-mailem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Našel jsem další moderátory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zdražil jsem členům klubu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okénko duševního zdraví.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dořešit vše, co mám v mailu nebo na Discordu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odjet na hory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Naučit bota vytvářet &lt;a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041033511-Server-Templates"&gt;zálohy&lt;/a&gt; klubu.&lt;/li&gt;

Co to obnáší? Líbí se mi jeho analogie, nebo důležitý a pro někoho ne úplně zřejmý postřeh, že open source projekt je produkt. A rady kolem toho, aby si člověk nastavil jasné hranice a nenechal se semlít nekonečným seznamem issues: „Everybody wins when the creator is healthy“&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2011/12/03/africa-rising"&gt;Africa rising&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;„Africa's enthusiasm for technology is boosting growth. It has more than 600m mobile-phone users—more than America or Europe. Since roads are generally dreadful, advances in communications, with mobile banking and telephonic agro-info, have been a huge boon.

Hned několik afrických měst se do roku 2100 stane, pravděpodobně zcela nevyhnutelně, jedněmi z nejlidnatějších měst na světě, nebo přímo nejlidnatější. Znáte je vůbec? Co se v nich děje? Proč tam žije tolik lidí? O uprchlících, migraci v rámci Afriky, válkách, odkazech kolonialismu, vlivu Číny, velkých rozdílech v bohatství, ale i o obyčejných lidech, kteří v těchto městech žijí.&lt;/li&gt;

Pavel Barša nad posledním textem sociologa Bruna Latoura - Novinky&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hutné čtení. „V tomto pojetí zůstává příroda a konkrétně Země stále něčím vnějším člověku a jeho nejdůležitějším aspiracím. Člověk se bez ní neobejde, netvoří však poslední horizont jeho sebeuskutečnění. Když ho donutí ekologické hrozby, může se snažit respektovat hranice, které příroda klade jeho záměrům. Stojí však mimo ni: nežije v ní, ale z ní.“ Nebo „Ekologie již nemůže být pouhým vnějším korektivem ekonomiky, ale celkovou osnovou, v jejímž rámci bude ekonomice přiděleno důležité, ale odvozené a omezené místo.“&lt;/li&gt;

Dny mohou být jen sváteční nebo pracovní (snad s výjimkou onoho záhadného povánočního týdne), a logika diářů nás nutí dodávat každé hodině nějaký program či výplň – i když spíme, sportujeme nebo se zkrátka jen povalujeme, pořád daný časový úsek „něčím“ vyplňujeme, a nedokážeme si představit čas vnímaný nezávisle na tom, čím dané měřené úseky strávíme.“&lt;/li&gt;

Vítejte ve virtuální poušti - VOXPOT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zajímavé zamyšlení. Ruší mě v něm hlavně to, že vše ilustruje na Facebooku a jeho metaverse, resp. virtuální realitě, a vztahuje to na celou technologickou scénu. Kde je komentář k poblázněné kryptogeneraci kolem web3? Kde jsou v tom zahrnuty pokroky s AI, které už každý týden vstupují do našeho běžného života skrze uměle generované obrázky, text, nebo zvuk? Kde je naděje v solarpunk? Podmořské kabely mají určitě uhlíkovou stopu, ale řešení klimatické krize si bez nich představit neumím. Zmínka o tom, že eskapismus si nemůžeme dovolit mi taky ruší vlny. Polovina popkultury v čele se Star Wars a Tolkienem je do velké míry eskapismus. Člověk prostě musí chvíli vypustit, aby mohl nabít baterky a měl sílu řešit reálné problémy v reálném světě. Možná je to myšleno tak, že bychom na to nemuseli vydávat tolik energie. Ale otázka je, kolik energie za rok vydá třeba jiná továrna na eskapismus, Hollywood (nebo Bollywood!). Možná je to myšleno tak, že by šlo o plošný eskapismus, kde se všichni před globálním oteplováním schováme do Mety. Ale to odporuje chování Minecraftové generace, která ve virtuální realitě žije od mala a přitom protestuje za klima.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Já si to pro sebe asi takhle holt sepsat potřebuji.
Pomáhá mi …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jak plánuji v příštím roce rozvíjet junior.guru?
Rozhodl jsem se, že si udělám jednoduchý odrážkový seznam s prioritami.
Jak už to tak u mě ale bývá, místo krátkého seznamu je z toho diplomka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ilustrační fotka s mapou" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/tabea-schimpf-9-xfykai6zi-unsplash.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figure-caption"&gt;
Fotka od &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/@tabeaschimpf"&gt;Tabea Schimpf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Já si to pro sebe asi takhle holt sepsat potřebuji.
Pomáhá mi to třídit myšlenky.
Zároveň aktuálně neexistuje důvod, proč to nemít transparentně, takže tady to je.
Třeba to bude někoho bavit číst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doplnění:&lt;/strong&gt; Svůj postup zaznamenávám do &lt;a href="https://github.com/orgs/juniorguru/projects/1/"&gt;tabulky na GitHubu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="co-se-povedlo"&gt;Co se povedlo&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#co-se-povedlo" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Začnu bilancí toho, co se mi podařilo.
Udělal jsem toho spoustu!
Původně jsem měl o kousek níž v tomto článku tyto věty:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure figure-blockquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nejsem spokojený s tím, jak jsem k práci na projektu přistoupil letos… Možná to vidím moc černě, ale jsem líný teď pročítat zpětně svoje týdenní poznámky, abych si uvědomil, co vše se povedlo.
Prostě teď mávnu rukou a udělám si strategii na další rok, abych měl příště pocit lepší.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A pak jsem si uvědomil, že tohle je FAKT toxické.
Všem juniorům pořád radím, aby se nestresovali tím, co všechno ještě neumí a co zatím nezvládli.
Aby se místo toho ohlédli a měli radost z toho, co se už naučili a co dokázali.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takže jsem ty týdenní poznámky prošel a tohle jsou hlavní věci, které se mi v roce 2022 povedly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Z loňských 20.000 Kč jsem se dostal na 40.000 Kč čistého měsíčně.
    Upozadil jsem co nejvíc dobrovolné příspěvky, stavím se na vlastní nohy.
    Přidával jsem věci na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;/open/&lt;/a&gt;, opravoval to, vylepšoval.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spustili jsme a dělali &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/podcast/"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;.
    Celý rok jsem se staral o jeho infrastrukturu a vylepšoval ji.
    Propagoval jsem jednotlivé epizody.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Byl jsem jako host ve 4 podcastech a měl jsem 2 přednášky.
    Na Heroine.cz mi letos vyšly dva články z celkových pěti.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Udělal jsem v klubu 12 online akcí.
    Vyřešil jsem konečně jak se poprat s limitem 25 lidí na video callu na Discordu (stream na YouTube).
    Sehnal jsem si výpomoc na nahrávání (spíš streamování), abych to nemusel už dělat sám.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Příručka prošla restrukturalizací, celá se přemístila na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/handbook/"&gt;/handbook/&lt;/a&gt; a rozpadla se na víc stránek.
    Přidal jsem celou novou stránku o CV.
    Rozepsal jsem stránky o Gitu, GitHubu, LinkedIn a hledání pomoci, když junior neví jak dál.
    Přidali jsme s Nelou &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/handbook/mental-health/"&gt;kapitolu o duševním zdraví&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nechal jsem si vyrobit hromadu samolepek.
    Poslal jsem je partnerským firmám v rámci PF.
    Lepil jsem je celý rok všude možně, od záchodů žižkovských barů až po Sněžku.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firmy byly letos v klubu víc vidět.
    Bot je začal automaticky vítat.
    Firemní členové dostávají automaticky role podle firem.
    Naprogramoval jsem účtování studentů vzdělávacích agentur v klubu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zdražil jsem, spustil jsem &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/pricing/"&gt;nový ceník pro firmy&lt;/a&gt;.
    A chystám se zdražit i členům v klubu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celý rok jsem vymýšlel, jak budu dělat marketing a nakonec jsem to &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/moje-nova-strategie-na-socialni-site/"&gt;vymyslel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skamarádil jsem se s &lt;a href="https://ajtyvit.sk/"&gt;Aj Ty v IT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spustil jsem formulář na stipendium.
    Došťouchal jsem koncept stipendia do něčeho, co funguje.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Změnil jsem, jak v klubu funguje mentoring.
    Došťouchal jsem koncept mentoringu do něčeho, co snad nějak funguje.
    Do mentoringu se zapojily dvě firmy, Mews a Pure Storage.
    Obě jsem v klubu představil v rámci samostatných akcí.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Řešil jsem v klubu první krize a neshody mezi lidmi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vytvořil jsem sadu úvodních tipů pro nově příchozí v klubu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Několikrát jsem překopával infrastrukturu bota.
    Stahování nabídek práce je teď rychlé dost na to, aby to nebyl problém a aby šlo přidávat další zdroje.
    Různými změnami jsem o třetinu zkrátil délku buildu.
    Povedlo se mi zlepšit vlastní &lt;em&gt;developer experience&lt;/em&gt;, když s botem něco dělám.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odstranil jsem Google Analytics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mám z udělané práce radost, ale věta „nejsem spokojený s tím, jak jsem k práci na projektu přistoupil letos“ stále platí.
Přijde mi, že moje priority měly vypadat jinak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dovolena"&gt;Dovolená&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dovolena" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V roce 2022 jsem byl
4 dny v lednu na horách,
6 dnů v březnu na kolech,
3 dny v srpnu s rodinkou ve Žďáře,
3 dny v srpnu na kolech (skončilo covidem),
3 dny v prosinci na horách.
Celkem jsem měl 19 dní dovolené.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Často šlo o víkendy, ne pracovní dny.
Nevím ale, jak jinak to mám počítat, když můj pracovní režim nelze srovnat se standardním zaměstnáním.
Víkendy a státní svátky dodržuji a snažím se během nich vypnout hlavu.
Někdy si vezmu den volna jen tak.
Jako dovolenou ale počítám souvislé vícedenní počiny, během kterých nejen že nepracuji, ale také změním prostředí a fakt na práci zapomenu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Předsevzetí:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minimálně dvakrát do roka si dám dovolenou, která bude aspoň týden v kuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="organizace"&gt;Organizace&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#organizace" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nejsem spokojený s tím, jak jsem k práci na projektu přistoupil letos.
Přijde mi, že jsem se motal v nekončeném programování a u toho jsem náhodně přeskakoval z úkolu na úkol podle toho, jak moc co hořelo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ani moje Trello s 50 sloupci a zhruba 100 až 500 kartičkami v každém z nich už mi nepřipadá jako nejlepší nástroj pro nějaké dlouhodobé plánování.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure figure-blockquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Častý scénář je takový, že máte poznámkový blok popsaný různými nápady, kterými jste tak přehlceni, že nevíte, do kterého se pustit dřív. Nakonec se obvykle nepustíte do žádného. Jak tedy co nejlépe určit priority jednotlivých z nich?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption class="blockquote-footer"&gt; Miroslav Uďan z Shoptet na své &lt;a href="https://www.svympanem.cz/17-jak-se-vyporadat-s-obavami-a-strachy/"&gt;příručce pro podnikatele SvýmPánem.cz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Já v tom jako systém mám, ale už prostě narážím na různé limity.
Například se mi to seká na mobilu!
Chci si něco zapsat, ale trvá dlouhé sekundy, než se to vůbec otevře, nebo než mohu přidat kartičku.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Moje Trello" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2022-12-20-at-22-52-38-junior-guru-trello.png" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doteď jsem určoval priority dalšího vývoje pocitově.
Zamyslel jsem se, co je v byznysu nejvíc potřeba, co hoří, nebo co v důsledku přinese nejvíc peněz.
To způsobilo, že jsem letos do příručky skoro nic nepřidal, nebo že jsem skoro celý rok programoval něco, čemu říkám „onboarding do klubu“, a ten doteď není hotový.
Teď si chci pro každou oblast určit maximálně tři priority, kterým bych se měl v roce 2023 věnovat.
Budu jim říkat předsevzetí.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A taky si tím chci vymezit, co letos udělat prostě nestihnu.
Budu v tom transparentní k sobě i druhým.
Nebudu slibovat, co slíbit nemohu.
Budu mít radost, když něco splním, a nebudu se mrskat, že tisíc jiných věcí jsem nestihl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Předsevzetí:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pojedu podle této strategie, která oddělí, co se snažím v roce 2023 stihnout, a co ne.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Změním způsob, jak si organizuji úkoly. Pročistím Trello. Možná ho i rozdělím na víc nástěnek.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i title="odhad" class="bi bi-clock"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; den&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="finance"&gt;Finance&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#finance" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nepodnikám pro peníze, ale protože mě fakt baví pomáhat juniorům.
Taky se mi líbí, že kariéra v IT může dát nečekané příležitosti lidem, kteří jich mnoho nemají.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure figure-blockquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jak s oblibou říkám, podnikání pouze pro peníze už je out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption class="blockquote-footer"&gt; Filip Molčan z Good Sailors v &lt;a href="https://www.fakturoid.cz/blog/2022/09/19/profil-zakaznika-goodsailors"&gt;rozhovoru pro Fakturoid blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Byť mě nutnost řešit peníze v podstatě obtěžuje, dělat to musím.
V jakém stavu je dnes junior.guru?
Grafy jsou &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;veřejně přístupné&lt;/a&gt;, můžete se podívat.
Chtěl jsem vydělat 40.000 Kč měsíčně čistého a to se mi letos povedlo.
Hurá!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Snímek obrazovky, jak se daří provozovat junior.guru" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid figure-img rounded" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2022-12-20-at-23-04-17-jak-se-dari-provozovat-junior-guru.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bohužel mi na všech frontách stoupají náklady.
Ať už jde o náklady plynoucí z růstu projektu, nebo náklady mojí rodiny.
Nežijeme ve vzduchoprázdnu, ale v nájmu v Praze na Žižkově, s dítětem, plynovým topením a stejnou inflací, jakou mají všichni kolem nás.
A živím celou rodinu, zatímco je žena na rodičovské.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takže je super, že jsem dosáhl cíle, ale budu jej muset zvýšit.
Zatím se mi dařilo meziročně dosáhnout dvojnásobku, takže si dám smělý cíl dostat se v roce 2023 na 80.000 Kč čistého.
Mnoha lidem to bude znít jako hodně peněz, ale je potřeba si uvědomit, že nejsem zaměstnanec.
Musím se vypořádat s hromadou rizik a vytvářet si finanční polštář pro případy, že se něco podělá.
A když budu mít příjem o dost vyšší, než je minimum toho, co potřebuji, budu mít klidnější spaní.
Když přijde nějaký výkyv v příjmech, například kvůli pandemii nebo válce, přečkám to a nebudu hned panikařit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nejde jen o to.
Když budou peníze, budu také smělejší investovat zpět do junior.guru.
Do různých pomocníků, nebo nástrojů, které mi umožní dělat věci lépe.
Víc hezkých věcí pro juniory!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Navíc mám pocit, že vytvářím skvělou službu s unikátní přidanou hodnotou.
&lt;a href="https://www.heroine.cz/zeny-it/6341-syndrom-podvodnice-vas-pri-praci-v-it-snadno-dozene-jak-proti-nemu-bojovat"&gt;Nevěřím tomu&lt;/a&gt;, ale všichni mi to stále opakují.
Bylo by dobré si přiznat dosavadní úspěchy, začít si vážit si své práce a času a dát na produkty adekvátní cenovky.
Přesunout to celé z kategorie „nejlevnější“ do kategorie „seriózní byznys“ u firem a „dostupné“ u lidí.
Nechci živořit a na klienty působit jako charita, které hážou do klobouku.
Nebo jako levný produkt, který je &lt;em&gt;too good to be true&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomu odpovídá podzimní změna ceníku pro firmy, se kterou jsem zatím velmi spokojen.
Myslím, že byznys model jsem ověřil a nastal čas opustit nesmělé zaváděcí ceny.
Jsem vděčný všem firmám, které mě podpořily v začátku a pomohly mi podnikání rozjet, ale teď je musím proředit.
Nemohu se věnovat 15 firmám, to je strašně moc režie.
Raději méně firem za víc peněz.
Firem, které vidí ve spolupráci s junior.guru největší hodnotu a stojí jim to za ty peníze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Také připravuji zdražení pro lidi v klubu, které nastane od 1.1.2023.
Už jsem to popisoval v &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/tydenni-poznamky-vymysleni-strategii/#zdrazeni-klubu"&gt;posledních týdenních poznámkách&lt;/a&gt;. Bude to něco mezi 150 Kč a 200 Kč měsíčně.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zdražení mi může vydělat víc peněz, ale taky nemusí.
Může odradit některé lidi a firmy, takže v důsledku to vyjde nastejno, nebo dokonce hůř.
To je prostě risk, se kterým do toho jdu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proaktivní sales vůbec nedělám, takže musím doplnit lidi a firmy pomocí inbound marketingu.
Pokud by šlo do tuhého, samozřejmě zkusím nějaké firmy oslovit, ale zatím to nebylo nikdy potřeba.
Chodily samy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Předsevzetí:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li value="0"&gt;Do konce roku 2022 připravím zdražení pro členy klubu.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i title="odhad" class="bi bi-clock"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; pár dní&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stanu se &lt;a href="https://www.jakpodnikat.cz/identifikovana-osoba-k-dph.php"&gt;identifikovanou osobou&lt;/a&gt;, abych mohl nakupovat služby z EU.
    Zdraží mi to účetnictví, ale vnímám to už jako &lt;a href="https://saneto.cz/proc-byt-identifikovanou-osobou/"&gt;překážku v rozvoji&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i title="odhad" class="bi bi-clock"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; pár dní&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Udělám na webu ceník, který přesvědčí ty správné firmy, že chtějí s junior.guru spolupracovat.
    Měl bych se zamyslet nad tím, že firmy mě najdou spíš přes aktivitu na LinkedIn než vyhledáváním.
    Asi nemá smysl dělat &lt;em&gt;landing pages&lt;/em&gt; na klíčová slova.
    Měl bych firmám hlavně osvětlit, např. &lt;em&gt;screencastem&lt;/em&gt;, jak to celé funguje, jak to vypadá, co získají.
    Ušetří mi to &lt;em&gt;sales call&lt;/em&gt; a třeba jich přesvědčím víc.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i title="odhad" class="bi bi-clock"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; měsíc&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vyladím &lt;em&gt;customer journey&lt;/em&gt;.
    Firma musí vědět vše o svém předplatném, v jakém je stavu, kolik čeho zbývá.
    Já i firma musíme mít včas informaci, že se blíží konec.
    Jasně si určím, kolik může být maximálně nejvyšších tarifů (přikláním se ke 4).
    Implementovat zdražování s ubývajícími místy.
    Implementovat vyprodání tarifu a ukazatel, kdy se možná zase místo objeví.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i title="odhad" class="bi bi-clock"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; měsíc&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uvodni-stranka"&gt;Úvodní stránka&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#uvodni-stranka" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když někdo napíše do prohlížeče junior.guru, uvidí tohle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Snímek obrazovky, úvodní stránka junior.guru" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid figure-img rounded" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2022-12-22-at-23-56-43-jak-se-naucit-programovat-a-ziskat-prvni-praci-v-it.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figure-caption"&gt;
Tragédie, na kterou se už nemůžu ani dívat.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když jsem projekt spustil, vypadala úvodní stránka jinak.
Po nějaké době jsem udělal s velkou slávou novou, lepší, voňavější.
Ale zastarala strašně brzy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proběhl &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/spoustim-klub/"&gt;pivot&lt;/a&gt;, vznikl klub, původní stránky se všechny sloučily pod příručku…
Dělal jsem na úvodní stránce drobné úpravy, které řešily to nejnutnější, ale realita je taková, že je potřeba to celé zbourat a udělat znova.
Bonusem budiž, že by to bylo už v novém designu, podobně jako je &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/club/"&gt;úvodní stránka klubu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abych to dokázal co nejlíp vymyslet, odebírám &lt;a href="https://www.designui.cz/landing-page-odshora-az-dolu?referral_code=31kql18"&gt;Landing page odshora až dolů&lt;/a&gt;, pravidelné rozbory od &lt;a href="https://www.lukasaugusta.cz/"&gt;Lukáše Augusty&lt;/a&gt;.
Nechystám to však moc jako prodejní stránku, spíš by to mělo plnit funkci rozcestníku.
Na junior.guru jsou jiné stránky, které jsou vyloženě prodejní, např. právě ta, která prezentuje klub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Předsevzetí:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Konec výmluv!
Vytvořím pro junior.guru novou úvodní stránku.
Vlastně už skoro cokoliv bude lepší, než to, co je tam teď.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i title="odhad" class="bi bi-clock"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; měsíc&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="produkty"&gt;Produkty&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#produkty" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aktuálně má junior.guru čtyři hlavní produkty, na které se odkazuje čtyřmi odkazy v hlavní navigaci na webu.
Každý musí dávat nějaký smysl a ideálně by měl také vydělávat peníze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Snímek obrazovky, menu na junior.guru" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid figure-img rounded" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/jg-menu.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To, co mám teď, je funkční.
Z toho mám jednoznačně radost.
Nevidím na horizontu žádný další pivot.
Budu to teď spíš stabilizovat, ladit detaily, vzájemně vše propojovat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polovina příjmů je od lidí v klubu, kteří platí předplatné.
Polovina je od firem.
Juniory považuji za primární klienty, ale jsem rád, že jsem závislý i na firmách.
Pomáhá mi to vidět obě strany mince a mediovat obě strany, místo abych juniory jen litoval, nebo je poplácával po zádech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nabídku pro firmy jsem trochu poladil s &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/pricing/"&gt;novým ceníkem&lt;/a&gt;.
Asi je ještě brzo na hodnocení, ale zatím jsem s výsledky spokojen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dovedu si představit ještě užitečnější produkty, ale bylo by to hodně programování a udržování, tak to zatím nechávám uzrát.
Jsem v kategorii „výdaje na dobro“, „výdaje na hiring“ a „výdaje na marketing“, navíc vůči juniorům.
To znamená, že při každém škobrtnutí ekonomiky budu první výdaj, který firmy škrtnou.
Do budoucna bych měl nabízet něco víc nepostradatelného, ale do té doby mě snad uživí i to, co mám teď.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taky je problém, že nabízím věci, které firmám přidělávají práci.
Platí za přístup do komunity, ale musí v ní být aktivní, aby z toho něco bylo.
Platí za akci v klubu, ale musí ji udělat.
Platí za inzerát, ale musí jej napsat.
Platí za hosta v podcastu, ale musí jej vybrat a ten tam musí jít.
Měl bych hledat věci, které naopak firmám čas šetří a problémy nepřidávají, ale řeší.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="prirucka"&gt;Příručka&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#prirucka" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Kde?&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;a href="https://junior.guru/handbook/"&gt;junior.guru/handbook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Funkce?&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Služba veřejnosti.
Baví mě to ze všeho nejvíc.
Rád píšu a u psaní vidím největší dopad, moje návody v součtu ovlivní nejspíš i tisíce lidí.
Příručka přitahuje největší návštěvnost a je to obsah, který má dobré SEO, takže lidi z vyhledávačů přivádí do klubu.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Peníze?&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Vydělává skrze &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/pricing/"&gt;drahou firemní spolupráci&lt;/a&gt; umožňující mít logo v záhlaví.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Snímek obrazovky, příručka" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid figure-img rounded" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2022-12-20-at-14-39-00-prirucka-pro-juniory.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K doplňování příručky mám absolutně největší počet poznámek a nápadů.
Ať už jde ale o drobné úpravy, nebo o celé nové kapitoly, letos jsem příručku moc posunout nezvládl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chtěl bych původní dlouhé stránky rozsekat na jednotlivá témata.
Raději víc přehledných a kratších stránek, než nekonečné nudle.
Je to lepší pro čtenáře, pro mě, i pro SEO.
Příručka taky potřebuje pěknou úvodní stránku a napojení kapitol na deset fází „cesty juniora“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Letos jsem poprvé zahrnul do příručky i text někoho jiného.
Spolu s Nelou jsme udělali kapitolu o &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/handbook/mental-health/"&gt;Psychice na cestě do IT&lt;/a&gt;.
Je fajn, že jsem nemusel problematiku nastudovat a mohl jsem využít odbornosti někoho jiného.
Než jsme ale společnými silami text dotlačili do finální podoby, vzalo si to mnoho koleček editací.
Musím počítat s tím, že ne každý odborník je zároveň odborník na psaní.
Časová úspora to tedy nebyla.
Za výsledek jsem rád, ale pokud to vezmu jako pilotní spolupráci tohoto typu, tak vlastně nevím, jestli mám takto oslovovat i další lidi, případně za jakých podmínek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Předsevzetí:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doplním do patičky každé stránky na příručce „diskuzi“.
    Ve skutečnosti nepůjde o diskuzi, ale o upoutávku na klub.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i title="odhad" class="bi bi-clock"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; jeden až dva týdny&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rozsekám stránky na příručce do jednotlivých kapitol tak, jak si je v budoucnu představuji.
    Stránky budou neúplné a nejspíš protkané upozorněními, že tam teprve přibude obsah.
    To se nedá nic dělat.
    V rámci tohoto úkolu aktualizuji i úvodní stránku příručky.
    Nic honosného, stačí když tam budou aspoň pod sebou nějaké &lt;a href="https://www.designui.cz/lekce/kartove-komponenty-v-ui"&gt;karty&lt;/a&gt;, pro každou fázi juniora.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i title="odhad" class="bi bi-clock"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; pár týdnů&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dopíšu alespoň tři kapitoly.
    Nabízí se dokončit &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/handbook/git/"&gt;Git a GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/handbook/linkedin/"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, nebo &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/handbook/help/"&gt;řešení problémů&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i title="odhad" class="bi bi-clock"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; jeden až dva měsíce&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="klub"&gt;Klub&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#klub" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Kde?&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;a href="https://junior.guru/club/"&gt;junior.guru/club&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Funkce?&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Prémiová služba pro ty, kdo platí.
Online komunita na Discordu pro lidi, kterým nestačí číst si příručku.
Kdyby si mě měl každý platit individuálně, utratí tisíce a já pomůžu deseti lidem za měsíc.
Takhle si mě každý zaplatí trošku a já pomůžu stovkám lidí.
A nejen já, pomáhají si i navzájem, což je skvělé.
Já nikdy nebyl na pracáku nebo na mateřské a je mnohem lepší, když někomu poradí ti, kdo tu zkušenost mají.
Pro mě je to užitečné i jako sběr témat pro příručku.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Peníze?&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Vydělává skrze měsíční členské předplatné a &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/pricing/"&gt;různé firemní spolupráce&lt;/a&gt;.
Je hlavním zdrojem příjmů pro celé junior.guru.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Snímek obrazovky, klub" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid figure-img rounded" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2022-12-20-at-14-37-45-klub-pro-zacatecniky-v-programovani.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Klub je produkt, který lidi chtějí.
&lt;a href="https://junior.guru/club/"&gt;Prezentace tohoto produktu&lt;/a&gt; má své mezery, retence taky, určitě je co zlepšovat.
Důležité ale je, že to má svoje spokojené zákazníky.
Potenciální počet zájemců v Česku a na Slovensku odhaduji na tisíce, v klubu mám teď přes 400 lidí.
Je tedy kam růst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Graf nárůstu členů v klubu" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid figure-img rounded" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2022-12-20-at-23-36-35.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Původně jsem si myslel, že lidi v klubu zůstanou tři měsíce, vše si tam vyřeší, a pak odejdou.
Realita je taková, že průměrná délka individuálně placeného členství zatím jen roste a teď je něco přes 9 měsíců.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Přibývání členů je dost pozvolné, ale je otázka, zda je to špatně, nebo spíš dobře.
Chvíli to stagnovalo a to jsem byl nervózní, ale skokové nárůsty stovek lidí taky nepotřebuji.
Nedokážu tak rychle reagovat, programovat, moderovat.
Bylo by obtížné tolik lidí najednou učit kulturu, kterou tam máme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mám dojem, že jsem se klubu věnoval hodně a je to tam celkem vyladěné.
Vždy je co zlepšovat, ale teď mám fakt pocit, že od spuštění klubu zanedbávám zbytek junior.guru a že bych měl svou pozornost už zase věnovat i jinam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když se zamýšlím, co mají být tři věci, které udělám, je to hodně těžké.
Napadá mě tolik vylepšení!
Dodělat tipy pro nově příchozí.
Vylepšit bota, aby se uměl poprat s forum kanály a nasadit je v klubu.
Najít dalšího moderátora nebo moderátorku.
Vylepšit stránku se seznamem &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/events/"&gt;přednášek&lt;/a&gt;, což je asi jediná věc na junior.guru, za kterou se stydím ještě víc, než za současnou úvodní stránku.
Vylepšit bota, aby zakládal na Discordu akce pro různé IRL srazy.
Vylepšit bota, aby v klubu podporoval různé rituály a zvýšil mezi lidmi &lt;em&gt;engagement&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenže takhle to prostě nejde!
To bude pořád něco a na příručku nebo úvodní stránku nikdy nezbude čas.
Musím si vybrat a smířit se s tím, že vše stihnout nemůžu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Předsevzetí:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stanovím si jasné ohraničení MVP s tipy pro nové členy v klubu a dopracuji je do této podoby.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i title="odhad" class="bi bi-clock"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; dva týdny&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přidám úplně základní podporu pro forum kanály a budu pozorovat, jak to lidi používají.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i title="odhad" class="bi bi-clock"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; týden&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vylepším bota, aby zakládal na Discordu akce pro různé IRL srazy.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i title="odhad" class="bi bi-clock"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; jeden až dva týdny&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Najdu dalšího moderátora nebo moderátorku.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;Kde?&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;a href="https://junior.guru/podcast/"&gt;junior.guru/podcast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Funkce?&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Služba veřejnosti.
Baví &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pavlinafronkova/"&gt;Pavlínu&lt;/a&gt;, já poskytuji zázemí.
Podcast zřejmě funguje i jako marketing.
Díky němu objeví samotné junior.guru i lidé, kteří zrovna neholdují nekonečným textům.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Peníze?&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Vydělává skrze &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/pricing/"&gt;drahou firemní spolupráci&lt;/a&gt; umožňující navrhnout do podcastu hosta.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Snímek obrazovky, podcast" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid figure-img rounded" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2022-12-20-at-14-38-51-podcast-pro-juniory-v-it.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Podcast je projekt &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pavlinafronkova/"&gt;Pavlíny Froňkové&lt;/a&gt;.
Přišla za mnou, že by chtěla dělat podcast, ale nebaví ji propagace.
Já se jí nabídl, že propagaci udělám a junior.guru bude její „redakcí“, ve které nebude muset nic moc řešit.
Může se soustředit na samotnou produkci.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cíle ohledně podcastu jako takového si tedy musí dát Pavlína, já jí do toho nekecám.
Na mých bedrech je zodpovědnost za redakci.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rozhodně bych měl podcast přesunout z &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/podcast.junior.guru"&gt;gitu a GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; na novou infrastrukturu, která se k tomu víc hodí.
Měl bych si při tom dát pozor na jednoduchost přidávání nových epizod, aby s tím Pavlína neměla zbytečně starosti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Měl bych pokračovat v propagaci podcastu, což teď budu dělat hlavně na LinkedIn a v newsletteru.
Líbilo by se mi nějak automaticky sbírat statistiky z různých platforem, ať víme na čem jsme, ale je to složité.
Možná by mohl pomoci &lt;a href="https://podstatus.com/"&gt;Podstatus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rád bych podcastu vytvořil lepší &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/podcast/"&gt;webovku&lt;/a&gt;, ale obávám se, že se to do roku 2023 už nevleze.
Ono to vypadá jednoduše, ale já vím, že když se do toho pustím, bude to zas projekt minimálně na měsíc.
Možná bych mohl udělat aspoň lepší promo obrázky, protože u podcastu je webovka stejně vedlejší.
Podstatné je, jak to vypadá v appkách.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jednou by mohlo být zajímavé pod hlavičkou junior.guru vydávat ještě jeden podcast.
Pokud to, co máme, se jmenuje „Junior Guru podcast“, tak tohle by byla „Junior Guru příručka“.
Publikovaly by se tam &lt;a href="https://beyondwords.io/"&gt;namluvené&lt;/a&gt; audio verze stránek z příručky.
Ale to teď určitě nezvládnu, to je hudba budoucnosti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Předsevzetí:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přesunu podcast na novou infrastrukturu (&lt;a href="https://www.cdn77.com/"&gt;CDN77.com&lt;/a&gt;).
    Začneme evidovat počty stažení u jednotlivých epizod.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i title="odhad" class="bi bi-clock"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; týden&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Začneme označovat epizody, které jsou finančně podpořené spoluprací s firmami.
    Začnu se s Pavlínou dělit o zisk, který mám díky spolupráci s firmami.
    Může to být i formou placení nástrojů, které k produkování podcastu potřebuje, nebo by jí usnadnily práci.
    Napadají mě &lt;a href="https://headliner.app"&gt;Headliner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.descript.com/"&gt;Descript&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://podstatus.com/"&gt;Podstatus&lt;/a&gt;, a další.
    Může to být i tak, že bude moci úkolovat mého pomocníka na audio/video, pokud by pro něj měla vhodné zadání.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vytvořím nové a lepší promo obrázky, které podcast doprovázejí.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i title="odhad" class="bi bi-clock"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; týden&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pokud bude energie a místo (blog? newsletter?), mohli bychom k podcastu publikovat i ručně psané texty, nebo &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@maestrosill/openai-whisper-ai-pro-p%C5%99epis-audia-na-text-97c1ae80feb6"&gt;automatické přepisy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;Kde?&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/"&gt;junior.guru/jobs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Funkce?&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Původně hlavní produkt, po &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/spoustim-klub/"&gt;pivotu&lt;/a&gt; zanedbávaný chudáček.
Dnes hlavně služba veřejnosti.
Místo, kde se budou agregovat inzeráty ze všech hlavních portálů a kde se inteligentně zobrazí pouze nabídky vhodné pro úplné začátečníky.
Zdá se, že mnoho začátečníků si mapuje svoje možnosti na trhu ještě předtím, než se vůbec začnou učit.
Inzeráty mají dobré SEO a lidi na ně chodí z vyhledávačů.
Díky tomu objevují celé junior.guru.
Inzeráty se propisují do klubu a lidé se tam o nich doví okamžitě, což mnozí oceňují.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Peníze?&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Monetizace přes jednotlivé inzeráty je &lt;em&gt;uphill battle&lt;/em&gt; a produkuje režii.
Smysl dává &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/pricing/"&gt;dlouhodobá firemní spolupráce&lt;/a&gt; umožňující mít inzerát vyvěšený klidně celý rok.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Snímek obrazovky, pracovní inzeráty" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid figure-img rounded" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2022-12-20-at-14-38-42-prace-v-it-pro-programatory-zacatecniky.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S pracovními nabídkami mám velké plány, ale nedostává se na ně, protože peníze mi vydělávají jiné věci.
Chtěli jsme s kamarádem převést bota, který inzeráty třídí, na AI.
To není až tak těžké samo o sobě, ale byla tam spousta překážek v tom, jak bot funguje.
Tragické je také zobrazení inzerátů na webu.
Opět místo, na které když v prohlížeči zabloudím, tak se za něj skoro stydím.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud vám z toho vychází, že by se to tedy mělo asi skoro celé předělat, protože mi nevyhovuje backend, ani frontend, tak nejste daleko od pravdy.
Nemyslím si však, že je v mých silách to v roce 2023 zvládnout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kdybych si měl vybrat, jestli mě víc frustruje backend nebo frontend, tak by to chtělo spíš poladit toho bota.
Když budu mít v pořádku data, tak už kolem nich produkt vymyslím a namaluju.
Současný stav bota mi však brání např. přidávat slovenské zdroje inzerátů.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jednorázově zadávané inzeráty dělají 4 % příjmů a opakovaně uvažuji nad tím, jestli je zachovat, nebo zrušit.
Kdo by chtěl mít na junior.guru inzerát, musel by mít dlouhodobé partnerství s klubem.
Aby však tento posun dával smysl produktově, potřeboval bych mít v jiném stavu jak backend, tak frontend.
Takže tohle si ještě počká.
Naštěstí mě tyto inzeráty nijak zvlášť nevytěžují a zatím každá tisícovka dobrá.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Předsevzetí:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Převedu bota na AI.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i title="odhad" class="bi bi-clock"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; měsíc až dva&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vylepším zobrazení inzerátů na Discordu.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i title="odhad" class="bi bi-clock"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; pár dní&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přidám Jobs.cz.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i title="odhad" class="bi bi-clock"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; několik týdnů&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Kde?&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Zatím &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/handbook/practice/#kde-hledat-kurzy-a-workshopy"&gt;tady&lt;/a&gt; a pak např. &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/topics/greenfox/"&gt;Green Fox Academy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/topics/engeto/"&gt;ENGETO Academy&lt;/a&gt;, apod.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Funkce?&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Strategický obsah.
Lidi, kteří chtějí začít s programováním, automaticky hledají kurzy.
Je to důležité pro SEO, začátečníci díky tomu objeví junior.guru.
Taky nechci připustit, že to někdo vyrobí dřív.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Peníze?&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Možná ze vzdělávacích agentur nějaké peníze vydyndám.
Kdo si bude na junior.guru platit dlouhodobou spolupráci, dostane nějaké zvýraznění v rámci tarifu.
Uvažuji ale i o dalším placeném zvýrazňování, nebo dokonce dražbou top pozic.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honzo?
Nepsal jsi náhodou o čtyřech produktech?
A o tom, jak jsi spokojený s tím, co máš?
Co to tady je?
Jaké kurzy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vážení, je to tak!
Tohle bude nový produkt.
On už tak trochu existuje, ale ve velmi, velmi omezené podobě.
Chtěl bych, aby to tahle věc v roce 2023 dotáhla do hlavního menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Je to celkem otočka.
Myslel jsem si, že spolupráce se vzdělávacími agenturami je slepá ulička.
Produkty, které jsem pro ně vymyslel, dávaly smysl vždy jen jedné firmě.
Nabídnout jednu věc více subjektům se nepovedlo.
Bylo těžké najít věci, kde si nelezeme do zelí.
Bylo těžké spolupracovat tak, aby nebyla ohrožena moje nezaujatost.
Všechny vzdělávací agentury, se kterými jsem komunikoval, byly spíš zdráhavé platit mi nějaké větší částky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V podstatě od vzniku junior.guru řeším, zda tam něco jako katalog mít a v jaké podobě.
Je obtížné to udělat správně a prezentovat kurzy opravdu nezaujatě.
Stávající &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/handbook/practice/#kde-hledat-kurzy-a-workshopy"&gt;abecední a převážně neudržovaný seznam&lt;/a&gt; naprosto nevyhovuje a některé agentury jej od začátku kritizují.
Proč nastal čas se do toho konečně pustit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agentur tady operuje stále více a hledají způsob, jak se zviditelnit.
    Některé sypou do médií jeden článek za druhým, nebo mají spoustu reklam.
    Jiné by třeba ocenily i nějakou další cestu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SEO mých existujících stránek pro jednotlivé agentury je už teď hodně dobré.
    Chodí na ně hromady lidí a agentury by byly rády, kdyby z nich na jejich stránky vedl byť jen odkaz.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V posledních týdnech se mi úplně samy ozvaly dvě agentury, zda spolu něco nevymyslíme.
    Mají peníze a neváhají je použít.
    Já jim ale nemám zas tak moc co nabídnout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agentury mají jiné „sezóny“ než firmy, které nabírají juniory.
    Stav ekonomiky je ovlivňuje, ale jiným způsobem.
    V krizi se může stát, že zatímco někde mraky lidí propouští, jinde mraky lidí rekvalifikují.
    Kdybych měl peníze z obou oblastí, diverzifikuji tím příjmy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na Facebooku jsem (před půl rokem?) viděl pár nadšenců, kteří se do toho už skoro pustili.
    Necítím se tím ohrožený, ale zároveň si to zase nemůžu nechat úplně proplout mezi prsty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ze začátku nejspíš ani nebudu na monetizaci tlačit.
Podstatné je, že bude katalog existovat a bude na junior.guru.
Rozhodně tam nechci žádné hodnocení uživatelů (hvězdičky, hlasování), to je cesta do pekel.
Začnu s tím, že vezmu suchá, objektivní data a dám je na jedno místo.
Bude to mít organickou návštěvnost z vyhledávačů a bude mi to připravovat půdu pro bermudský trojúhelník, v němž budou mizet peníze do mých kapes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Honzův bermudský trojúhelník" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid figure-img rounded" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/bermudskytrojuhelnik.svg"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figure-caption"&gt;
Produkty, které ještě neexistují, jsou šedé.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chci, aby junior.guru bylo první místo, kam jde každý, kdo začíná s programováním.
Tohle do toho jednoznačně patří.
A nebudu nijak zastírat, že cílem je platforma, kde budou kurzy jen položkou v seznamu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud to bude silná platforma, nebudou mě moci agentury ignorovat.
Čím víc lidí bude chodit na katalog, tím bude důležitější tam být.
Na druhou stranu, bude stačit hodit mým směrem pár peněz a marketing bude vyřešený.
Články v médiích budou bonus pro ty, kdo na to mají energii.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A když už budu mít s agenturami obchodní vztahy, mohu vše dál propojovat.
Do několika let bych mohl vytvořit tržiště juniorů, kde se budou potkávat kandidáti, firmy, agentury.
Taková platforma by šetřila práci všem zúčastněným a mohla by se stát tím, co by mě do budoucna živilo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Než se k něčemu takovému dostanu, uplyne však ještě hodně času a vyfakturuji ještě mnohá loga.
Líbilo by se mi však tímto směrem junior.guru posunovat.
Byla by to kvalitnější a opravdu potřebná služba, a ne něco v kategorii zbytných firemních výdajů.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Předsevzetí:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Udělám MVP katalogu vzdělávacích agentur.
    Bude to evoluce toho, co už mám, ne revoluce.
    Bude tam naprosté minimum nejnutnějšího.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i title="odhad" class="bi bi-clock"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; měsíc&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rozšířím ceník o nabídku pro vzdělávací agentury, která katalog nějak zahrne.
    Nedávat zbytečně věci zadarmo.
    Jak ukazuje RyanAir nebo &lt;a href="https://remoteok.com/hire-remotely"&gt;RemoteOK&lt;/a&gt;, cenovku může mít cokoliv.
    Je to moje platforma a i barva nebo logo jsou věci, které tam být nemusí, když agentura nezaplatí.
    Cílem je zkoušet, získávat zpětnou vazbu, iterovat a najít to, co je pro mě nejjednodušší byznys a dává to všem největší smysl.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i title="odhad" class="bi bi-clock"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; týden&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rezie"&gt;Režie&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#rezie" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Čas mi žerou hlavně schůzky, neplacené spolupráce, marketing a technický dluh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="schuzky"&gt;Schůzky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#schuzky" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To je stále kafíčko sem a kafíčko tam.
Nebo „pojďme si zavolat“.
Přijde mi, že v USA jsou zvyklí dělat byznys tak, že se na web dá formulář pro zadání karty a hotovo.
Všichni jsou příliš daleko od sebe a je jich příliš mnoho na to, aby je vůbec napadlo scházet se.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tady se ale chce scházet a povídat si každý.
Na jednu stranu je milé, že to jde a že se tady každý tak trochu známe.
Na druhou stranu mám někdy pocit, že nedělám nic jiného.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problém je, že často je to opravdu přínosné a nelze to odhadovat předem.
Někdy se efekt projeví až mnohem později.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Předsevzetí:&lt;/strong&gt;
Budu se snažit chránit si víc svůj čas.
Nepřišel jsem ale na žádný „vzorec“, který by šlo v tomto případě použít.
Napadá mě pouze vytvořit dostatek materiálů, které mohou sloužit jako předpřipravené odpovědi, např. &lt;em&gt;screencast&lt;/em&gt;, který vysvětluje klub.
To by řešilo minimálně část &lt;em&gt;sales callů&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="neplacene-firemni-spoluprace"&gt;Neplacené firemní spolupráce&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#neplacene-firemni-spoluprace" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firma chce něco „společně vymyslet“, ale ani &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/pricing/"&gt;základní spolupráce&lt;/a&gt; se jim nechce platit.
Musím se v takovém případě naučit říkat jasné NE.
Byznys, jak ho dělám, může být úspěšný jen v případě, že si budu svého času vážit a budu si jej úzkostlivě chránit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zní to jednoduše, ale nebývá to tak jednoznačné.
Občas mi něco nabízejí pro členy klubu, zdarma, nebo se slevou.
Nebo nabízí přednášku.
Jenže co to znamená pro mě?
Pokud jejich produkt neznám, musím si jej projít.
Zjistit, zda to chci, zda to členové ocení.
Ověřit si, jak ten člověk přednáší a jestli to není jen promo na jejich produkt.
Pak to členům nějak poskytnout.
Komunikovat kolem toho.
Jenže kdybych měl toto dělat s každou věcí, kterou mi někdo nabídne, tak nedělám nic jiného.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Předsevzetí:&lt;/strong&gt;
Určité věci jsou &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/pricing/"&gt;nově pro firmy vyloženě naceněny&lt;/a&gt;.
Nabídky neplacené spolupráce přicházející od firem, které neznám, budu odmítat.
Výjimkou budiž soutěže, které je většinou snadné provést, ať už jde o lístky, knihy, nebo cokoliv jiného.
Jinak si budu neplacenou spolupráci dost vybírat.
Například pokud vím, že lidé používají software od JetBrains, sám jim napíšu a navrhnu jim spolupráci na jiném půdorysu, než je v ceníku.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="marketing"&gt;Marketing&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#marketing" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tohle jsem řešil tak moc, že to vydalo na &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/moje-nova-strategie-na-socialni-site/"&gt;samostatný článek&lt;/a&gt;. Tady je shrnutí:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Zpětná vazba&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Sbírat informace o tom, odkud chodí lidi.
A další zpětnou vazbu.
Jak se vám líbila přednáška?
Které funkce klubu máte nejraději?&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;SEO&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Soustředit se na ty části webu, které přivádějí lidi z vyhledávačů.
Stránky kurzů.
„Diskuze” pod příručkou.
Pracovní inzeráty.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Newsletter&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Umožnit lidem odebírat novinky o junior.guru pomocí newsletteru a zavést posílání článků mailem i tady na osobním blogu.
Možná rozjet junior.guru blog, kde budou tyhle věci vycházet a pak to akorát rozesílat i mailem.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Vymyslet si strategii svého publikování na LinkedIn.
Tohle moc nespěchá a dám tomu zatím spíš volný průběh.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Rozjet pravidelné online Q&amp;amp;A pro komunity, jako jsou např. PyLadies.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Podcast&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Dát víc lásky podcastu.
Profesionalizovat upoutávky.
Vylepšit technické zázemí.
Dělit se s Pavlínou o zisk.
Vytvořit paralelní podcast s audio verzí příručky?&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Audit „hurá-do-IT“ článků&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Stránka na příručce, kde komentuji „hurá-do-IT“ články a kde na sebe poskytnu kontakt novinářům.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Věrnostní program&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Kdo doporučí další členy do klubu, dostane nějakou výhodu nebo slevu.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Anketa (bonus)&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Tohle v článku nebylo, ale děje se to.
S jednou firmou plánujeme udělat anketu mezi juniory.
Mohl by to být zajímavý marketing a vypadnou z toho nejspíš zajímavá data.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Předsevzetí:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li value="0"&gt;Vymyslím a zrealizuji nejjednodušší možný způsob, jak zjišťovat, odkud do klubu lidi přišli.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i title="odhad" class="bi bi-clock"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; pár dní&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Umožním lidem odebírat tento blog a novinky na junior.guru skrze newsletter.
    Pokud k tomu bude potřeba i blog přímo na junior.guru, vyrobím blog.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i title="odhad" class="bi bi-clock"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; týden až měsíc&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rozjedu pravidelné Q&amp;amp;A pro komunity.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i title="odhad" class="bi bi-clock"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; pár týdnů&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Budu se podílet na anketě mezi juniory.
    Pokud z toho budou grafy, vložím je na vhodná místa do příručky.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i title="odhad" class="bi bi-clock"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; v souhrnu určitě týdny&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ve skutečnosti toho ale udělám víc, protože některé z dalších věcí se promítají do předsevzetí v jiných oblastech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="technicky-dluh"&gt;Technický dluh&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#technicky-dluh" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;CI&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Celé junior.guru funguje tak, že se minimálně jednou denně na CI spustí všechny skripty, posílá se něco na Discord, pošlou se maily, vytvoří se SQLite databáze, z té se pak vyrobí web, ten se někam deployne jako statická stránka a celé to skončí, data se spláchnou.
Neexistuje nic, co by kontinuálně běželo.
Žádná aplikace, žádná „opravdová“ databáze.
Mám to tak schválně, ale nechci teď příliš odbočovat vysvětlováním.
Podstatné je, že už celá ta věc trvá 30 minut a potřebuji to nějak optimalizovat.
Letos jsem tomu věnoval hodně času, abych to vůbec na těch 30 dostal.
Také bych si občas potřeboval něco zaznamenat, opravdu persistentně.
Toto musím nějak dodělat a uzavřít.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Flask&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Původně bylo junior.guru postaveno jako Flask aplikace, která se seskládá do statického HTML pomocí &lt;a href="https://github.com/Frozen-Flask/Frozen-Flask"&gt;Frozen-Flask&lt;/a&gt;.
Nyní jsem v půlce cesty v migraci na &lt;a href="https://www.mkdocs.org/"&gt;MkDocs&lt;/a&gt;.
Bylo by fajn, kdyby se mi povedlo Flask už pohřbít.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;CSS&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Původně jsem měl vlastní CSS.
Pak jsem měl vlastní CSS, ale organizované do BEM komponent.
Třetí, a věřím že na dlouho finální, je (S)CSS postavené na nejnovějším &lt;a href="https://getbootstrap.com/"&gt;Bootstrapu&lt;/a&gt;.
Bylo by fajn, kdyby se mi povedlo pohřbít předchozí dvě verze CSS, které v kódu stále jsou a některé stránky je využívají.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Gulp&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Frontend webu skládám pomocí &lt;a href="https://gulpjs.com/"&gt;Gulpu&lt;/a&gt;.
To není samo o sobě nic, co by mě trápilo, protože mám jen minimum JavaScriptu.
Problém je, že mám při buildu spoustu &lt;em&gt;ad hoc&lt;/em&gt; optimalizací (např. obrázků), které způsobují, že to celé trvá přes pět minut.
Bylo by fajn, kdyby se mi povedlo to překopat a čas buildu minimalizovat.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Open source&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Když někdo pošle Pull Request, CI spadne.
Celkově není repozitář s kódem dělaný na to, aby do něj někdo přispíval.
V README prakticky nic není.
Bylo by fajn to trochu poladit.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Data&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;V mnoha případech předpokládám, že se něco nestane.
Bylo by fajn se začít trochu víc soustředit na bezpečnost nebo zálohy.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Předsevzetí:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opravím posílání e-mailů inzerujícím firmám a další akutní chyby.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i title="odhad" class="bi bi-clock"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; jeden až dva týdny&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vyřeším kešování generovaných obrázků.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i title="odhad" class="bi bi-clock"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; několik týdnů&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vyřeším rychlost buildu webovky (Gulp).
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i title="odhad" class="bi bi-clock"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; několik týdnů&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flask a CSS nechám vyhnít.
S tím, jak předělám různé stránky na webu se postupně dostanu do stavu, kdy budu moci tyto věci smazat.
Nemá smysl se do toho pouštět nějak cíleně.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="osobni-a-komunitni-projekty"&gt;Osobní a komunitní projekty&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#osobni-a-komunitni-projekty" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kniha &lt;a href="https://www.oliverburkeman.com/books"&gt;Four Thousand Weeks&lt;/a&gt;, kterou teď čtu, mi s každou stránkou zdůrazňuje, že můj život je konečný.
Co z toho vyplývá?
Minimálně to, že se do něj nevejde nic nekonečného, např. nekončený seznam úkolů, nebo osobních projektů.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historicky se mi podařilo předat hned několik věcí, např. organizaci &lt;a href="https://pyvo.cz/brno-pyvo/"&gt;brněnského Pyva&lt;/a&gt;, propagaci konference &lt;a href="https://cz.pycon.org/"&gt;PyCon CZ&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://zitkino.cz/"&gt;Žít kino&lt;/a&gt;, nebo &lt;a href="https://redis-collections.readthedocs.io/"&gt;Redis Collections&lt;/a&gt;.
Proaktivní předávání je ale taky práce a já na ni teď nemám energii.
Mohl bych udržovat &lt;em&gt;status quo&lt;/em&gt;, jenže si zároveň myslím, že na některých věcech už plním pouze roli žáby sedící na prameni.
Bude lepší prostě oznámit, že je nechávám plavat.
Kdo bude chtít, může se jich ujmout.
A pokud nebude chtít nikdo, tak asi ta věc není zas až tak nepostradatelná a nechť umře.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lidi z týmu kolem &lt;a href="https://pyvo.cz/praha-pyvo/"&gt;pražského Pyva&lt;/a&gt; po dekádě organizování zápasili s tím, aby se srazu dokázali pravidelně věnovat.
Skončilo to hromadným složením funkcí a předáním akce do rukou komunity.
Vzniklé vakuum přitáhlo nové osobnosti a sraz v pohodě pokračuje dál.
Kdo ví, jestli by se noví lidé angažovali, kdyby původní organizační tým zůstal?
Noví organizátoři si mohou vybrat, v čem chtějí navazovat a v čem chtějí inovovat.
Nemusí se domlouvat se starými pardály, kteří sice nemají čas, ale mohou mít silné názory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A já to udělám podobně.
Prostě uvolním prostor a třeba mě nahradí jiní.
Noví, čerství, nadšení, plní energie a nápadů.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;honzajavorek.cz&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Psát na blog mě baví a chtěl bych sem psát ještě víc.
Rozjedu newsletter, díky kterému budou mít moji fanoušci možnost odebírat články e-mailem.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;cojeapi.cz&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Měl bych si přestat nalhávat, že to ještě někdy dodělám.
Jsem rád, když píšu texty na příručku nebo na blog.
API už nedělám a nic mě teď nemotivuje k tomu, abych se jim nějak zvlášť věnoval.
&lt;a href="https://cojeapi.cz/"&gt;Co je API?&lt;/a&gt; je projekt, který mám fakt rád a přál bych si, aby takové materiály existovaly.
Vím, že mnoha lidem to doopravdy pomohlo API vysvětlit a písemně nebo osobně mi děkovali, že ten web existuje.
Já na něj ale prostě už čas nemám.
Kdo byste měli chuť pokračovat, ozvěte se mi.
Jsem ochoten i prodat a převést domény cojeapi.cz, jakpsatapi.cz a whatisapi.org.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;docs.pyvec.org&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Komunitní dokumentace na &lt;a href="https://docs.pyvec.org/"&gt;docs.pyvec.org&lt;/a&gt; mě stále baví a rád ji budu dál udržovat jako zahradník.
Navíc se to dobře doplňuje s mou prací pro výbor spolku.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;python.cz&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Moje děcko.
Mám tisíce snů a nápadů, jak by ten web mohl vypadat.
A víte co?
Přišel čas si přiznat, že je nikdy nedokážu zrealizovat.
Končím jako maintainer &lt;a href="https://python.cz/"&gt;python.cz&lt;/a&gt;, české webovky programovacího jazyka Python a jeho komunity.
Jako aktivní mládežník jsem ji před dekádou vydupal ze země, když v Česku začínaly Python srazy.
Směle si myslím, že i díky této stránce, která všechny spojovala napříč republikou, byla naše komunita nakonec tak úspěšná.
Nastal však čas, abych se odvalil a našel se někdo z dnešní aktivní mládeže, kdo to celé předělá k obrazu svému.
Když bude chtít a vyžádá si to, rád si zavolám a své představy nasdílím.
Když nebude chtít, uklidím se a budu mlčet.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;blog.python.cz&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Blog Python komunity jede na redakčním systému, na kterém fungoval dřív můj osobní blog.
Svůj blog jsem mezitím několikrát předělal, ale komunitní blog zůstal na staré technologii.
Je obtížné do něj přispívat a zasloužil by si přesun na něco normálního, i kdyby to mělo být třeba &lt;a href="https://dev.to/"&gt;dev.to&lt;/a&gt;, nebo i kdybychom měli platit, či někam sami nahodit &lt;a href="https://ghost.org/"&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt;.
Já to však nezvládnu.
Pokud jsem jím ještě byl, končím jako maintainer &lt;a href="https://blog.python.cz/"&gt;blog.python.cz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;pyvec.org&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Není v mých silách tento web dál udržovat.
Věřím, že by to mohli zvládnout členové Pyvce, nebo by nám mohl pomoci někdo jiný z komunity.
Pokud jsem jím ještě byl, končím jako maintainer &lt;a href="https://pyvec.org/"&gt;pyvec.org&lt;/a&gt;.
Samozřejmě do webu v případě potřeby přispěju, ale nemohu se o něj starat.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;github.com/Frozen-Flask&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Maintainer, který není schopen najít si na projekt čas, prostě není jeho maintainer.
Funkci jsem &lt;a href="https://github.com/Frozen-Flask/Frozen-Flask/pull/128"&gt;složil&lt;/a&gt; 11.12.
Dává mi to smysl i z toho titulu, že junior.guru migruji z Frozen-Flask na MkDocs, takže mi mizí byznysové důvody se na udržování Frozen-Flask podílet.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;facebook.com/groups/pyonieri&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/pyonieri"&gt;Pyonieri&lt;/a&gt; jsou největší česká Python komunita na Facebooku.
V podstatě od vzniku skupiny tam dělám administrátora a moderátora.
Nemám na to už vůbec čas a popravdě ani chuť.
Ne, že by to bylo vyloženě náročné, ale asi prostě nedává smysl, aby dělal admina někdo, kdo už na Facebook nechce skoro vůbec chodit.
Budu rád, když mě kluci nechají za zásluhy v týmu, ale napíšu jim, že moderovat už nebudu.
Měli bychom najít nové lidi, kteří tým doplní.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Výbor Pyvce&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Nadále se plánuji na základě svého mandátu vzešlého z voleb věnovat administrativě &lt;a href="https://pyvec.org/"&gt;Pyvce&lt;/a&gt; jako člen výboru spolku.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Zelení&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Nadále se neplánuji přidat jako člen do &lt;a href="https://www.zeleni.cz/"&gt;Strany Zelených&lt;/a&gt;.
Vím, že být členem strany neznamená vůbec nic, mnoho členů stran je zcela neaktivních.
Já ale neaktivním členem být nechci.
Buď členem nebudu, nebo se tomu budu nějak věnovat.
A aktuálně se tomu prostě věnovat nemůžu, fakt nemám kdy.
Je rozdíl něco jednorázově podpořit a být aktivním členem nějaké organizace.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Předsevzetí:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rozjedu newsletter, díky kterému budou mít moji fanoušci možnost odebírat můj blog e-mailem.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i title="odhad" class="bi bi-clock"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; týden&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Projekty, se kterými plánuji seknout, buď archivuji, nebo jasně označím jako neudržované.
    U komunitních projektů to jasně oznámím minimálně na &lt;a href="https://docs.pyvec.org/operations/support.html#sit-kontaktu"&gt;Pyvec Slacku&lt;/a&gt; a odhlásím se z různých udržovacích povinností kolem repozitářů (např. dependabot).
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i title="odhad" class="bi bi-clock"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; den&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Budu se věnovat Pyvci jako člen výboru.
    Pokud se někdo ozve a bude chtít poradit s některým z projektů, o které jsem se staral, pokusím se najít si čas aspoň na videohovor.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i title="odhad" class="bi bi-clock"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; jeden den měsíčně&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="konkurence"&gt;Konkurence&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#konkurence" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neexistuje.
Se vzdělávacími agenturami si někde trošku šlapeme po prstech, někde spolupracujeme.
Za konkurenci je nepovažuju, protože dělají úplně něco jiného a s jiným cílem.
Našlapuji kolem nich opatrně, aby nikdo nemohl zpochybnit mou nezaujatost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agentury provozují kurzy, já stavím platformu a kurzy provozovat nehodlám.
Chci, aby junior.guru bylo první místo, které člověk najde, když bude chtít do IT.
Tam najde vše ostatní.
Kurzy najde přes junior.guru, jako jeden z prostředků, které mu pomohou se dostat k cíli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevím, čím to je, ale co se týče přímé konkurence, junior.guru kvete na hřbitově.
Během jeho existence už zanikly projekty coderlist.io, levio.cz, &lt;a href="https://oyestartups.com/interviews/entry-level"&gt;entrylevel.io&lt;/a&gt;, juniorsintech.com…
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dawidzamkowski"&gt;Dawid Zamkowski&lt;/a&gt; má &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dawidzamkowski/status/1435509392103944194"&gt;asi největší komunitu juniorů v Polsku&lt;/a&gt; a provozuje juniorjobsonly.com, ale nepovedlo se mu to monetizovat.
Zkouší štěstí v jiných projektech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Možná je to tím, že se nevzdávám.
Umím programovat a nebojím se to využít.
Na jednu stranu v tom často zabřednu a nejsem efektivní se svým podnikáním.
Na druhou stranu je to superschopnost, která mi umožňuje vytvářet unikátní věci s unikátní hodnotou.
Nejsem odkázaný na &lt;em&gt;No Code&lt;/em&gt; řešení, nebo najímané programátory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mám obrovský nasbíraný kapitál, ať už jde o úspory, zkušenosti, kontakty, schopnost práce s komunitou, s firmami.
Díky angažmá v &lt;a href="https://byznys.ihned.cz/c1-65593630-oracle-kupuje-za-miliardy-korun-cesky-start-up-apiary-zakladatele-ve-firme-zustavaji"&gt;Apiary&lt;/a&gt; aspoň trochu tuším, jak u podnikání kroutit kormidlem.
A k tomu všemu mám v jednom člověku, který žije v ČR a staví lokální produkt, naprosto minimální provozní náklady.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Odložím si sem úryvek z rozhovoru se zakladateli Entry Level. Začínali v březnu 2020, tedy jen o pár měsíců později než já.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure figure-blockquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…we launched Entry Level on Product Hunt and Hacker News. Our Hacker News post was successful and we reached #1 on the front-page for most of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What has been your biggest failure or struggle?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our biggest struggle has been getting companies to pay to post on our site. Our main focus has been providing value to job seekers searching and applying. We believe that once having those users, companies would want to apply on Entry Level along with our marketing outreach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zní to dost podobně jako něco, na co jsem přišel &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/spoustim-klub/"&gt;v lednu 2021&lt;/a&gt;.
Nevím, kdy dělali ten rozhovor, ale od té doby už jsem o nich nikdy neslyšel.
No, gratuluju, být celý den odkaz číslo jedna na Hacker News se jen tak někomu nepovede.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zvraty"&gt;Zvraty&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#zvraty" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Existuje spousta věcí, které mohou můj byznys fatálně ovlivnit.
Fatálně znamená osudově, nemusí to být nutně k horšímu.
Zkusím si aspoň pár zvratů sepsat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moje hlavní mašinka na peníze je aktuálně závislá na Discordu.
Moje priority a hodnoty jsou zatím zjevně v souladu se směrem, jaký razí Discord, takže si toto soužití velmi pochvaluji.
Jinými slovy, Discord dělá vše pro to, aby mi usnadňoval práci.
To se ale může kdykoliv změnit a já s tím vůbec nic neudělám.
Časem třeba diverzifikuji příjmy, nebo produkt došťouchám jinam, ale v současné chvíli by byla pro junior.guru změna kurzu Discordu likvidační.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nepříjemnosti může přinést situace na trhu.
Pokud by se někde zadrhla kolečka ekonomiky, můžu mít problém.
Na druhou stranu, zatím junior.guru přežilo několik covidů a válku, takže jsem v tomto směru optimistický.
Nebezpečný není jen nedostatek, ale i skokový zájem.
Pokud by během týdne přišly do klubu stovky lidí, bylo by to dost na prd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Další riziko je AI.
Rozhodně si vyhradím nějaký den jen na to, abych si pohrál se Stable Diffusion, ChatGPT, apod.
Chtěl bych potom tady na blog napsat, co si o tom myslím.
Zatím si nejsem jistý, zda mě to úplně zdevastuje, nebo mi to naopak v jednom člověku umožní škálovat věci, o kterých jsem nikdy ani nesnil, že by škálovat jít mohly.
Pokud AI způsobí, že nebudeme potřebovat programátory, tak mám mnohem větší problém, než je konec junior.guru.
V opačném případě budu mít dobře našlápnuto k tomu, abych v jednom člověku dokázal věci, které byly dřív nepředstavitelné bez firmy o padesáti lidech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure figure-blockquote figure-tweet"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet blockquote-tweet blockquote"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The repeated blind spot I see with people about AI is that their main reply is "it's not good enough" and "not passable as human" etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But that all implies millions of people aren't working to improve it every day&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you wait until it's good enough you're too late&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figcaption class="blockquote-footer"&gt; @levelsio (@levelsio) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1606370475583602702?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 23, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slabým místem jsem samozřejmě i já sám a moje duševní nebo ekonomická pohoda.
Můžu vyhořet, přehltit se, zhroutit se.
Ale taky prostě jen dlouhodobě onemocnět.
Mohou se nám tak moc zvýšit náklady na život (nájem, energie…), že podnikání nebude mít šanci stíhat to dorovnávat.
V takovém případě hrozí, že si budu muset najít normální &lt;em&gt;day job&lt;/em&gt; a junior.guru dát na vedlejší kolej.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Předsevzetí:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Budu o sebe pečovat.
    Dovolená, sport, a tak.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Najdu si terapeuta.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pohraju si s AI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="startup-ideas"&gt;Startup Ideas&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#startup-ideas" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Při svém podnikání vidím příležitosti, co by šlo ještě dělat.
Musím si ale vybírat, do čeho půjdu.
Musím držet směr, říkat NE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tady jsou nápady na věci, které nejspíš nikdy dělat nebudu.
Byznys model vám nevymyslím, marketing taky ne.
Bez realizace jsou jakékoliv nápady spíš bezcenné, tak je tu klidně napíšu.
Je taky dost možné, že některé z těch věcí by neuživily ani jednotlivce, natož firmu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Efektivní rychlovýuka angličtiny specializovaná na programování a IT obecně.
    Cílovka jsou lidi, kteří angličtině dřív moc nedali, ale teď ji potřebují pro svou práci v IT.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terapeuti specializující se na programátorské profese a IT obecně.
    &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/handbook/mental-health/"&gt;Nela&lt;/a&gt; má výhodu, že umí i programovat.
    Její klienti mají radost, že chápe věci, které je frustrují (firemní kultura, meetingy, SCRUMy, rušení projektů, reorganizace, akvizice…) a dokáže se do nich dobře vcítit.
    Chtělo by to více takových.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Služba na mentoring v Česku a na Slovensku.
    Nějaké věci už &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/handbook/practice/#najdi-si-mentora"&gt;existují&lt;/a&gt;.
    Většina využívá mentory dobrovolníky.
    Některá tržiště mají i české placené mentory, ale nejsou v češtině a nikdo je tu nezná.
    Lidi 1:1 mentory stále hledají a mnoho by jich za to i platilo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Audit juniorních projektů.
    Začátečníci se učí a vyrobí při tom projekt.
    Je potom potřeba, aby se na něj někdo podíval a vychytal jim základní problémy.
    Commitnutý secret token, git ignore, .pyc soubory…
    Aspoň základní věci, které se stále opakují.
    Něco takového by možná zvládli v &lt;a href="https://www.codeac.io/"&gt;Codeac&lt;/a&gt; a bavíme se o tom, že to zkusíme.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Audit CVček.
    &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/handbook/cv/"&gt;Návod&lt;/a&gt; nestačí.
    Ani šablona, kdybych ji udělal, stačit nebude.
    Lidi chtějí osobní zpětnou vazbu na právě to jejich CV z kreativní šablony nalezené na internetu.
    Podle mě by za to i platili.
    Totéž cílené rady ohledně LinkedIn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Audit pracovních nabídek.
    Napsat správně inzerát je trochu věda.
    Mnoho firem, ale ani profesionálních náborářů, a dokonce ani personálek, to know-how prostě nemá.
    Výslekem jsou tragické texty plné odrážek a nesmyslů jako „&lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/mlady-kolektiv/"&gt;mladý dynamický kolektiv&lt;/a&gt;“.
    Věřím, že u mnoha lidí to není záměr.
    Snaží se, ale tápou.
    Co tak umožnit masám psát dobře napsané inzeráty?
    Kdyby svou sepsanou nabídku mohli za pár kaček nahrát do nějakého stroje a dostat audit, jaká slova nemají používat, jak to mají strukturovat, jak nemají mít osmnáct odrážek v požadavcích apod., tak by to něco vydělat mohlo.
    Pokud to dokáže hlídat nelegální věci, jako např. sexistický jazyk, dovedu si představit i korporátní tarif pro firmy, kde svým recruiterům plošně přikážou to používat.
    A věřím, že taková věc by mohla mít šanci inzeárty na trhu trochu kultivovat, což je hezká mise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O všechny ty věci se nějak svým byznysem otírám.
To ale neznamená, že pokud něco z toho začnete dělat, tak budeme konkurenti.
Věci z tohoto seznamu bych spíš rád outsourcoval.
Kdyby existovala super služba na CVčka, rád to přestanu řešit a budu vám tam (třeba se slevou) posílat lidi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="honzo-neblbni"&gt;Honzo, neblbni&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#honzo-neblbni" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ke každé oblasti jsem si určil zhruba tři věci, kterým se budu věnovat.
Ono to vypadá jako hodně, ale vy vůbec netušíte, co všechno jsem nechal v Trellu jako věci, které v roce 2023 neudělám!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dobrá, přiznávám, pořád je to hodně.
Takhle by to nešlo.
Takže tady jsou moje tři fakt nejvíc nejdůležitější priority na rok 2023:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li value="0"&gt;Do konce roku 2022 připravím zdražení pro členy klubu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rozjedu newslettery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Udělám MVP katalogu vzdělávacích agentur. Bude to evoluce toho, co už mám, ne revoluce. Bude tam naprosté minimum nejnutnějšího.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vytvořím pro junior.guru novou úvodní stránku.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A minimálně dvakrát do roka si dám dovolenou, která bude aspoň týden v kuse.
Ty ostatní věci když se nestanou, tak se svět nezboří.
Když zvládnu tohle, tak budu za rok při bilancování spokojený.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A to je vše! Kdo to dočetl až sem, tak jste fakt dobří. Zasloužíte si aspoň slevový kód ZVEDAVOST, který dává 5% slevičku předplatného v klubu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category><category term="junior.guru"></category></entry><entry><title>Týdenní poznámky: Vymýšlení strategií</title><link href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/tydenni-poznamky-vymysleni-strategii/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-12-16T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2022-12-16T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Honza Javorek</name></author><id>tag:honzajavorek.cz,2022-12-16:/blog/tydenni-poznamky-vymysleni-strategii/</id><summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utekl zas nějaký ten týden (9. 12. až 16. 12.) a tak &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/tydenni-poznamky-mentalni-a-digitalni-uklid/"&gt;stejně jako minule&lt;/a&gt; sepisuji, co jsem dělal a co jsem se naučil.

&lt;p&gt;Měl jsem v plánu vymyslet a sepsat strategii na sociální sítě a celkovou strategii na rok 2023.
Tu marketingovou jsem vymyslel a sepsal: &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/moje-nova-strategie-na-socialni-site/"&gt;Moje nová strategie na sociální sítě&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mohl jsem to vydat jen jako seznam chystaných změn, ale cílem bylo uveřejnit i „proč“.
No a když sepisuji své hluboké myšlenky, tak je z toho vždy dlouhý článek, který píšu několik dní.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Článek s marketingovou strategií a i tyto poznámky zkouším psát novou metodou.
Zkouším &lt;a href="https://sive.rs/1s"&gt;Writing one sentence per line&lt;/a&gt;, tedy psaní každé věty na nový řádek.
Ve zdrojovém Markdownu, výsledný publikovaný článek má věty normálně.
Opravdu to vede k úplně jinému psaní a přemýšlení nad textem.
Jestli je výsledek čtivější, to ale neposoudím.
Rozhodně to nevypadá, že by mě to nutilo psát texty kratší.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tu celkovou strategii jsem zatím jen vymýšlel.
Taky jsem chtěl shánět vánoční dárky.
To se mi spíš nedařilo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plánoval jsem číst Four Thousand Weeks, ale nečetl jsem to.
Místo toho jsem se totiž ponořil do &lt;a href="https://www.svympanem.cz/"&gt;SvýmPánem.cz&lt;/a&gt;.
Četl jsem to ve volných chvílích v průběhu celého týdne a až včera jsem to dorazil.
Přišlo mi to dost užitečné a chtěl jsem si to projít, než začnu sepisovat ty strategie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="podcasty"&gt;Podcasty&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#podcasty" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vyšel se mnou &lt;a href="https://restarty.dev/epizody/2022/honza-javorek-kazdy-moze-programovat/"&gt;rozhovor na (re)štarty v IT&lt;/a&gt;.
A lidem se to líbí!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure figure-blockquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naprosto skvělej rozhovor 🙂 vlastně jsem nikdy snad neslyšel od nikoho v podcastu celý jeho IT příběh a myšlenky a dost mě to bavilo 😄 Tak třeba mě v důchodu taky někdo pozve a budu moci vyprávět, jak jsem se k IT dostal 😄 😄&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption class="blockquote-footer"&gt; Vojta Mádr&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nebo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure figure-blockquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libový rozhovor. Honza mi vždycky připadal jako zajímavý člověk a víc jsem se o něm dozvěděl a ve spoustě věcech se potkal. Nevím, jestli bych měl stejný dojem u jiných lidí, ale tady jsem byl fakt rád, že dostal tolik (neomezeně) prostoru, prakticky všechno mi přišlo zajímavé a celkově super zážitek!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption class="blockquote-footer"&gt; Matěj, vlastními slovy: 33letý týpek prvním rokem na pozici juniorního Java vývojáře&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taky tento týden vyšla nová epizoda našeho podcastu: &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/podcast/"&gt;Lukáš Konarovský (Fakturoid) o podnikání, třeba i v IT&lt;/a&gt;
Ještě si ho musím pustit, ale už teď se na něj těším.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Snímek obrazovky, nová epizoda Junior Guru podcastu" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid figure-img rounded" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2022-12-16-at-15-53-11.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zdrazeni-klubu"&gt;Zdražení klubu&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#zdrazeni-klubu" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Držel jsem to, jak nejdéle to šlo, ale přišla chvíle, kdy zdražím klub.
Firmám jsem zdražil už v září, pro členy klubu nastavím novou cenu od 1. ledna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Náklady se mi zvyšují a zároveň mám pocit, že klub se pomalu stává nejlevnější věcí na zeměkouli.
Aktuálně stojí měsíčně jako dvě kostky másla, ačkoliv poskytuje ohromnou hodnotu a je tady nespočet „funkcí“, které by jinde stály tisíce (kariérové poradenství, CVčka, 1:1 mentoring, apod.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novou cenu ještě nemám vymyšlenou.
Stále je cílem poskytnout něco dostupného.
Stipendium je funkční a kdo na to mít nebude, může si o něj na webu zažádat a bude mít klub na rok zdarma.
O to je pro mě rozhodování jednodušší.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otevřel jsem v klubu diskuzi o ceně.
Spotify (písničky) je &lt;a href="https://www.spotify.com/cz/premium/"&gt;za 145 Kč&lt;/a&gt;, Zelenka (novinář) stojí &lt;a href="https://mimo-agendu.ghost.io/"&gt;119 Kč měsíčně&lt;/a&gt;, Zelení (členství ve straně) &lt;a href="https://pridejtese.zeleni.cz/"&gt;125 Kč měsíčně&lt;/a&gt;.
Klub (kompletní support při změně kariéry) je za 109 Kč.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Aktuální ceny členství v klubu" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2022-12-16-at-15-55-51.png" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zatím se shodujeme, že do 200 Kč měsíčně by to bylo pro lidi v pohodě.
Tak nějak jsem nad tím uvažoval i já.
Lidi to spíš podporují, než že by protestovali.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Někdo navrhoval, že by mohly být v klubu různě drahé tarify, s nimiž by šlo využívat různé části Discordu, nebo některé jen číst.
To je díky Memberful překvapivě jednoduché zrealizovat, ale já jsem zatím dost pevně přesvědčený, že je to pandořina skříňka, kterou nechci otevírat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Také jsem uvažoval, jestli nezrušit roční předplatné.
Cílem by bylo především zjednodušit ceník.
Promyšlené to ale zatím moc nemám.
Také by se dalo zavést měsíční předplatné za dobrovolnou cenu pro ty, kdo by mě chtěli extra podpořit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stávající členové to ví první a mají možnost o tom jednak diskutovat, jednak si do konce roku nakoupit členství na rok dopředu za stávající cenu.
Jestli jim aktuální cenu podržím o něco déle, záleží dost na tom, jak složité by to bylo v Memberful udělat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cenu doladím nějak přes Vánoce.
Chci se ještě přesně podívat, kolik mě stojí každá platba na poplatcích.
Taky si chceme s investorkou během svátků spočítat rodinné finance.
Samotná změna bude pak dost rychlý proces.
Nemyslím si, že je potřeba ji nějak speciálně oznamovat veřejnosti, důležité bylo oznámit to členům.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi"&gt;Další&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nainstaloval jsem si novou &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=circleci.circleci"&gt;CircleCI extension do VS Code&lt;/a&gt;.
    A je celkem užitečná!
    Napovídá při psaní konfigurace, hlídá verze orbů, dává mi postranní panel s přehledem buildů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Řešil jsem, že odkaz na článek se sice pošle na Telegram, ale pak se nepovede uložit zpětný odkaz zpět na blog.
    To znamená, že se nezobrazí komentáře, dokud to ručně neopravím.
    Je to &lt;a href="https://github.com/EndBug/add-and-commit#the-commit-from-the-action-is-not-triggering-ci"&gt;tímhle&lt;/a&gt;, ale řešení, které je tam popsáno, mi zatím nefunguje.
    Používám PAT, nicméně &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/honzajavorek.cz/commit/742f969f9a34d8838a0e82d2ab8e48bcd9eb5c12"&gt;commit pro komentáře k článku o marketingu&lt;/a&gt; stejně CI nespustil a nevyvolal nové zbuildění blogu.
    Mentální poznámku, že to mám dořešit, mám &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/honzajavorek.cz/issues/219"&gt;zde&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Byl jsem na historicky prvním koncertu dua MAD, jehož polovinu tvoří můj dobrý kamarád Míla.
    Moc pěkný zážitek!
    Silný.
    Téměř dvoudenní.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investorka mi řekla, že jsem možná neměl rušit sociální sítě, dokud nemám rozjetý funkční newsletter, kam by se lidi přesunuli.
    Jsem si toho vědom, ale už jsem to prostě fakt chtěl mít vyřešené a uzavřené.
    Chtěl jsem to už pustit z hlavy.
    Na posílání e-mailem pracuju.
    Čest všem, kdo si to tady najdou i bez toho!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volal jsem si s Marianem z Engeta a připravovali jsme jeden společný projekt.
    Bylo to milé a produktivní.
    O tomto projektu už jsem informoval členy klubu a ti do něj přispěli svými nápady.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Řešil jsem s daňařem paušály, identifikovanou osobu a &lt;a href="https://www.mpsv.cz/-/prispevek-na-bydleni"&gt;příspěvek na bydlení&lt;/a&gt;.
    Aby si mohla o příspěvek zažádat OSVČ, potřebuje asi 200 papírů a potvrzení.
    V rámci terapie jsem si přečetl &lt;a href="https://seznam-zpravy.u.mailkit.eu/mc/VVCVVPEP/ABODXQDXAGSNVGLJUP/CVLCWVLULEP"&gt;Pod čarou o nesrozumitelné byrokratické komunikaci&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opravil jsem blog tak, abych mohl používat drafty (rozepsané články) a schované články.
    Pelican &lt;a href="https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/content.html#publishing-drafts"&gt;takové věci umí&lt;/a&gt;, ale můj vlastní kód a moje pluginy s tím nepočítaly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psal jsem si s podporou na MailChimpu a zjistil jsem, že RSS-to-email mají, ale pro nové uživatele to mají schované.
    Zapli mi to prý.
    Neměl jsem čas to zatím dál zkoumat.
    Ptal jsem se, jestli to teda plánují do budoucna nějak podporovat, ale na to odpověděli neurčitě.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V rámci úklidu ve svém digitálním životě jsem &lt;a href="https://github.com/Frozen-Flask/Frozen-Flask/pull/128"&gt;odstoupil&lt;/a&gt; jako open source maintainer projektu Frozen-Flask.
    Procházel jsem issues i na svém blogu a mnoho jsem jich &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/honzajavorek.cz/issues/8#issuecomment-1344789047"&gt;pozavíral&lt;/a&gt; s tím, že je nikdy neudělám.
    Archivoval jsem na GitHubu hned dva své projekty: &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/tipi"&gt;tipi&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/pocket-recommendations"&gt;pocket-recommendations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vyzdobili jsme byt větvemi a baňkami.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Složil jsem IKEA skříňku na hračky a protřídili jsme hračky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odpovídání v klubu, e-maily, &lt;a href="https://docs.pyvec.org/operations/support.html#sit-kontaktu"&gt;Pyvec Slack&lt;/a&gt;, atd.
    Upgradování závislostí na vlastních i Pyvec projektech (zpracovávání Pull Requestů, které průběžně posílá Dependabot).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 8 dní od 9. 12. do 16. 12. jsem naběhal 9 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 1 hodinu a zdolal při tom 9 kilometrů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finanční výsledky, návštěvnost a další čísla k JG &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;mám přímo na webu&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vydám na blogu strategii na rok 2023.
    Nebude to nic světoborného, prostě se jen zamyslím a sepíšu si, na co se chci v různých oblastech soustředit.
    Možná bych si mohl dát i nějaké cíle!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uklidím si pracovní Trello a stanovím si tři nejdůležitější věci, které bych měl na JG vyřešit do konce roku.
    V novém roce už pojedu podle strategie z předchozího bodu.
    Půjde především o opravy a zvýšení ceny za klub.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přípravy na Vánoce.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Když na něco narazím a líbí se mi to, sdílím to &lt;a href="https://t.me/honzajavorekcz"&gt;na Telegramu&lt;/a&gt;.
Od posledních poznámek jsem sdílel toto:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.svympanem.cz/"&gt;Příručka pro podnikatele - SvýmPánem.cz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Přečetl jsem to celé. Hodně zajímavý zdroj informací pro začínající podnikatele. Takové „podnikání guru“ 😀&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/moje-nova-strategie-na-socialni-site/"&gt;Moje nová strategie na sociální sítě — Javorové lístky&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moje nová strategie na sociální sítě&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://restarty.dev/epizody/2022/honza-javorek-kazdy-moze-programovat/"&gt;Honza Javorek: Každý môže programovať&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Asi nejosobnější rozhovor, který se mnou někdo udělal 🙂 Bavíme se tam o tom, s čím jsem si hrál jako děcko a o celé mojí kariérní cestě. Řešíme startup, korporát, vysokou školu. Bavíme se o hloupých otázkách, strategii učení, pohovorech, vysokých školách, zaučování juniorů. Nabušená hodina dvacet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mujrozhlas.cz/rapi/view/episode/be370e0c-762a-375e-9fa5-a78987c3907b"&gt;Všímáte si toho hezkého v životě nebo jen plníte úkoly? Radost je dovednost, kterou se lze učit — Balanc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zmínili hodně zajímavých věcí. Například se snížením očekávání a neplánováním mám hodně dobrou zkušenost, protože to je způsob, jakým sbíráme emoce a zážitky. Když jde všechno podle tudůlistu, tak je to nuda. Samozřejmě se mi to nedaří vždy, většinou jedu spíš podle těch tudůlistů. Ale třeba dovolené jsou lepší spontánní.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Dec/5/rust-chatgpt-copilot/?utm_source=hackernewsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=code"&gt;AI assisted learning: Learning Rust with ChatGPT, Copilot and Advent of Code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Simon zkusil využít AI jako pomocníka při tom, jak se učil nový programovací jazyk. Dokázalo mu to skvěle vysvětlovat kód, učit ho, jak a co má dělat. Ale taky si to vymýšlelo úplné hovadiny. „I've started thinking of them as an excellent teacher for some topics who is also a conspiracy theorist around others: you can have a great conversation with them, but you need to take everything they say with a very generous grain of salt.“&lt;/li&gt;

Ze zábavy se stala nepříjemná režie, se kterou jsem nevěděl, jak naložit.
Jak to celé dopadlo?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sociální sítě" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/dole777-EQSPI11rf68-unsplash.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figure-caption"&gt;
Fotka od &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/@dole777"&gt;dole777&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na můj „inzerát“ se ozvali dva, tři lidi.
Než jsem ale přistoupil k nějakému výběrovému řízení, uvědomil jsem si, že vůbec nevím, co těm lidem nabízím.
Kolik jim mohu dát peněz?
Kolik mi takový marketing vlastně vydělá?
Může si to můj byznys dovolit?
Má ten člověk vymýšlet, jak to má celé fungovat, nebo hledám opravdu jen pomocníka, který dostane jednoduché úkoly a ty udělá?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jak-jsem-sel-na-konzultaci"&gt;Jak jsem šel na konzultaci&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#jak-jsem-sel-na-konzultaci" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zasekl jsem se.
Lidem, kteří se mi ozvali, jsem se omluvil, že si to celé musím nejdřív promyslet.
Pak mi poslalo WebExpo e-mail o tom, že publikovali záznamy přednášek.
Zahlédl jsem mezi nimi &lt;a href="https://slideslive.com/38984420/outsourcing-your-marketing-do-your-homework-first"&gt;Outsourcing Your Marketing? Do Your Homework First&lt;/a&gt; a skončilo to tím, že jsem se &lt;a href="https://www.janadolejsova.cz/"&gt;Janě Dolejšové&lt;/a&gt; ozval s poptávkou.
Domluvil jsem si jednorázovou konzultaci, která by mi ukázala nějaký směr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Jana Dolejšová na WebExpo 2022" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2022-12-15-at-23-44-42-outsourcing-your-marketing-do-your-homework-first.png" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jana mi nejdřív poslala dotazník, který jsem asi půl dne vyplňoval a už to bylo velice užitečné.
V mnoha ohledech mi už tohle dost pomohlo uspořádat si myšlenky.
Následně jsme si zavolali a hodinu se bavili o tom, co bych mohl dělat a jak bych mohl k marketingu přistupovat.
Odcházel jsem s hromadou poznámek a pocitem, že mi někdo za hodinu ušetřil zhruba tři roky nějakých pokusů a omylů, kdybych se na totéž snažil přijít sám.
Navíc nešlo o obecné rady, ale opravdu věci, které byly na míru pro můj byznys:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Měl bych se ptát lidí, kde junior.guru našli.
    Provozuji komunitu, takže to mám jednodušší, než kdokoliv jiný.
    Pomůže mi to zjistit, které marketingové kanály dávají smysl.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Věřit intuici, ale zaznamenávat si data strukturovaně a nenechávat je pouze v hlavě.
    Hlava má velké kognitivní zkreslení.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Měl bych si jasně určit, které věci dělat nebudu a proč.
    To mi rozváže ruce pořádně dělat věci, které smysl dávají.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pokud dělám byznys v jednom člověku, je legitimní vykašlat se na nějaký kanál, pokud je to pro mě opruz.
    I kdyby byl nejvýkonnější.
    Musím najít věci, které budou mít „dostatečnou“ výkonnost a zároveň mě budou bavit.
    Hledám kompromis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na sociálních sítích funguje nejlépe zajímavý, bohatý, hluboký obsah, tvořený přímo pro ně.
    To, co tam dávám já, jsou spíš „novinky“ a odkazy ze sociálních sítí jinam.
    Je otázka, jak velkou mají hodnotu pro sledující.
    Pokud to chci dělat, takové novinky pro mě dokáže psát každý marketingový junior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dělat sociální sítě přes osobní profily má možná větší &lt;em&gt;organický reach&lt;/em&gt; (dosah k lidem i bez toho, abych za něj platil), ale je nemožné na ně něco posílat automaticky nebo to delegovat na další lidi.
    Přitom má smysl firemní profily mít a aspoň trochu je udržovat, protože lidi tam chodí pro potvrzení, že věc žije a existuje.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mohu členy poprosit, aby nějaké věci sdíleli na svých sociálních sítích.
    Tím mohu &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt; delegovat svou vlastní činnost na sítích.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Značka junior.guru je &lt;em&gt;lovebrand&lt;/em&gt; a má komunitu.
    Já ji přitom nevyužívám.
    Mohu najít někoho, kdo bude spravovat např. Instagram pro junior.guru rád úplně sám od sebe, např. výměnou za členství zdarma.
    Mohu lidi prosit, aby psali na junior.guru recenze, hodnotili podcast, apod.
    Mohu zkusit aktivizovat členy, aby mi napsali doporučení, nebo dělali rozhovory s jinými členy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Když dám lidem příležitost, aby mi pomohli, a vysvětlím jim, že jim to pomůže v kariéře, tak se rádi přidají.
    Bude pro ně benefit pracovat pro něco, co už má nějaké jméno, jako má junior.guru.
    Mohu pomocníky motivovat k tomu, aby si budovali vlastní &lt;em&gt;brand&lt;/em&gt; a promovat je: „Pepa je borec, dělá rozhovory pro junior.guru“&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jak-jsem-nic-nezrealizoval"&gt;Jak jsem nic nezrealizoval&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#jak-jsem-nic-nezrealizoval" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rozhodl jsem se, že nebudu hned nikoho najímat.
Sociální sítě jsem zatím nechal na volnoběh, než si ve všem udělám pořádek.
Když jsem potřeboval něco důležitého oznámit, udělal jsem to.
Jinak jsem ale na profily nic navíc netlačil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Přemýšlel jsem nad tím, jaké provedu změny.
Nechal jsem se přesvědčit, že přesunout propagaci junior.guru na osobní profily má pro mě spíš nevýhody a že ji přesunu zpět na ty „firemní“. Hned to ale neudělám, aby to nevypadalo zmatečně. Spojím to s ostatními změnami.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co dál?
Jaké sociální sítě bych mohl s junior.guru opustit?
Které sítě mě baví a bude mi dělat radost pro ně tvořit obsah?
Nejdříve mi přišlo nemožné své aktivity v tomto směru nějak omezit.
Každá síť má něco.
Postupně jsem si však na tu myšlenku zvykal.
A začal jsem přemýšlet i nad tím, co vlastně z jaké sociální sítě dostávám já osobně.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A odkud přicházejí lidi?
Byl jsem uprostřed programování tzv. &lt;em&gt;onboardingu&lt;/em&gt;, tedy funkce, která členům mojí komunity posílá po registraci sadu tipů, jak mají s klubem pracovat a jak se v něm orientovat.
Nenapadlo mě nic lepšího, než to s tím spojit.
Prostě jedním z „tipů“ bude zpráva, kde se lidí zeptám, odkud přišli, ne?
Stačí, když si pospíším s programováním a brzy budu mít automat, který pomůže členům i mému marketingovému rozhodování.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No a víte co? Programuju to doteď.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jak-me-prestaly-bavit-site"&gt;Jak mě přestaly bavit sítě&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#jak-me-prestaly-bavit-site" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk koupil Twitter.
Nešlo ani o to, že bych s tím měl zásadní problém, ani že by mi chyběli lidé, kteří utekli na Mastodon.
Stalo se to, že jsem se poprvé od založení Twitter profilu &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1591801045264760832"&gt;zamyslel&lt;/a&gt; nad tím, co mi ta síť dává.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jsem s ní spokojený?
Vůbec.
Dřív jsem tam měl spoustu zajímavých informací z oboru a bylo to spíš pro geeky.
Teď je to plné politiky, novinářů a agresivních debat.
Retweety jsou v rukou uživatelů, ale algoritmus si našel cestu přes srdíčka.
Vypnout algoritmus lze, sledovat jen vybrané lidi lze, ale původního zážitku se mi v poslední době dosánout nepovedlo.
Četl jsem k tomu hromadu článků, které jsem pak i sdílel pod týdenními poznámkami tady na blogu.
Asi nejlépe to &lt;a href="https://nazory.aktualne.cz/komentare/drzme-muskovi-palce-at-twitter-znici-co-nejrychleji/r~8f7199bc6a7211edba5b0cc47ab5f122/"&gt;vystihl David Klimeš&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure figure-blockquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dávno pryč jsou časy, kdy Twitter využívali k přijatelné výměně názorů nejprve internetoví „geekové“, pak technologicky gramotní politici, novináři a osobnosti veřejného života. Nyní už je - jako jakákoliv jiná velká sociální síť - obětí svého vlastního polarizujícího algoritmu. Ať tam tedy kdokoli začne debatu o čemkoli, dočká se po chvíli osočování, výsměchu, šikany - až nakonec dojde i na Hitlera se Stalinem. Mnozí však i tohle rádi snášejí, protože bez twitterové popularity a srdíček svých fanoušků už se nedokáží obejít.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A totéž Facebook.
Tam už jsem to cítil dlouho.
Kdysi síť, kde jsem se dověděl o tom, co dělají kamarádi.
Dnes už mi algoritmus kamarády vůbec nezobrazuje.
Nebo tam raději už ani nic nepíšou.
Procházím desítky notifikací, z nichž zhruba dvě denně vedou na něco, co mě alespoň trochu zajímá.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Každý den se přichytím, jak na Facebook píšu propracovaný komentář.
Co komentář, přímo názor!
Na obrubníky a pouliční lampy, nebo na psí hovna.
V sousedské skupině vedu debaty, které jsou na život a na smrt.
Pokud mi tyto vznešené názory nikdo nelajkne, nebo na ně nikdo neodpoví, nebudu už za 15 minut vědět, že jsem je vůbec psal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Produkuji písmenka do komentářového políčka, přitom je to celé úplně jedno.
Efekt, jaký to má, vzhledem k vynaložené energii a času, je nulový.
Akorát živím modrou mašinu na reklamy a trávím tím čas.
Svůj omezený čas na tomto světě.&lt;/p&gt;

Ne úplně, protože se může hodit mít tam přístup.
Mohu Facebook třikát prohlásit za mrtvý, ale fotka dnešního obědového menu blízké restaurace tam prostě je a já chci být schopen ji vidět.
Nehodlám tam ale pravidelně chodit.
Totéž Twitter.
Aplikace v mobilu jsem neměl už dlouho, teď jsem se všude odhlásil i na webu.
Přestal jsem tam dávat odkazy na svoje články z blogu a přemýšlím, jak jinak lidi informovat o nových článcích.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Podobně jsem odešel i z Instagramu, ale s ním mám dlouhodobě složitý vztah, tak to asi není taková změna.
Nikdy to nebyla síť, ke které bych měl speciální osobní pouto.
Historicky jsem tam ve vlnách buď zuřivě přispíval, nebo dlouhodobě nedával vůbec nic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jak-jsem-objevil-e-maily"&gt;Jak jsem objevil e-maily&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#jak-jsem-objevil-e-maily" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když jsem lidem oznámil, že o nových článcích na mém osobním blogu se už nedoví na Twitteru nebo Facebooku, byli trochu smutní.
Blog sice má RSS, ale mnoho lidí dnes už neví co to je, nebo to prostě nepoužívá.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když má člověk silný obsah, lidi si jej najdou tam, kde publikuje.
Já si ale nemyslím, že jsem zase taková celebrita, abych si mohl úplně dělat co chci.
Musím jít lidem trochu naproti, aby si články četli.
I ti, kdo je čtou rádi, potřebují vědět, že vyšly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vzpomněl jsem si, že například &lt;a href="https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/tag/pod-carou-61945"&gt;Pod čarou&lt;/a&gt; odebírám jako newsletter.
Rád bych to měl v RSS čtečce, ale RSS jsem k tomu prostě nenašel, tak to trpím mezi e-maily.
A shodou okolností jsem si pustil &lt;a href="https://mimo-agendu.ghost.io/v-zahranici-jsou-newslettery-fenomen-ceka-nas-boom-jako-u-podcastu-veri-kavka/"&gt;epizodu podcastu Jakuba Zelenky&lt;/a&gt;, kde zrovna zpovídal autora &lt;a href="https://newslettery.cz/"&gt;newslettery.cz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heuréka!
Prostě oživím svůj zaprášený účet na MailChimpu a budu lidem novinky posílat postaru e-mailem.
Nebudu závislý na žádné platformě.
Mohu e-maily snadno automatizovat, tedy naprogramovat skládání části nebo celého jejich obsahu.
Tentýž obsah mohu přitom snadno mít i na webu, na vlastní doméně.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kompletní kontrola.
Musk zničí Twitter.
Meta začne ovládat svět a já třeba nebudu chtít mít nic společného s Facebookem nebo Instagramem.
YouTube mi někdo zabanuje.
Pracně nasbírané publikum mi najednou může být k ničemu.
Oproti tomu seznam e-mailů, ten mi nevezme ani ďábelské GDPR.
E-mail je prostě nezávislá, distribuovaná platforma.
A jediný algoritmus, který se musím naučit přečůrat, je spam filtr.
Když si sdělení otevře polovina příjemců, stále to bude mít větší efekt, než nepřítomně scrollující lidé na sítích.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na junior.guru kdysi newsletter byl.
Tvořil jsem ho ručně a pak jsem v tom už neviděl smysl, tak jsem ho přestal posílat.
Seznam kontaktů však stále mám, takže bych měl na co navázat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technicky to zatím nemám dořešené a ani tento blog, ani nic na junior.guru zatím e-mailem odebírat nelze.
Pracuji však na tom, aby to časem šlo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jak-jsem-si-vymyslel-data"&gt;Jak jsem si vymyslel data&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#jak-jsem-si-vymyslel-data" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pořád nevím, odkud mi přicházejí lidi.
Vařím z vody.
Respektive z dojmů, které si ukládám v hlavě.
A vím, že tyhle dojmy mají velké kognitivní zkreslení, ale prostě to zatím risknu.
Někdy je lepší udělat NĚCO a zkoušet, než stát na místě.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myslím si, že na sociálních sítích mám hlavně fanoušky a kamarády, které zajímá, co je na junior.guru nového.
Nemám pocit, že by z mých aktivit na Facebooku, Twitteru, nebo Instagramu přicházeli noví lidé.
Jednotky možná.
Například z Facebooku, když mám zrovna nějaké příspěvky ve skupinách jiných komunit.
Celkově ale spíš bída.
Na Instagramu mi přibývají sledující, ale podle mě to jsou spíš lidi, kteří původně junior.guru našli jinde.
Když jsem se svou aktivitou na sítích polevil, na počtu nově příchozích do klubu se to ani po měsících neprojevilo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jak mě tedy lidé objevují?
Nějaké signály tu jsou i bez čísel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mnoho nových členů v klubu zmiňuje podcast, když se ostatním představuje.
    A při srovnání s podobnými podcasty nemá &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/podcast/"&gt;Junior Guru podcast&lt;/a&gt; vůbec špatná čísla poslechovosti.
    Zrovna nedávno mi přišel e-mail, že jsme na Apple Podcasts v kategorii Technologie na 5. místě českého žebříčku a na 9. místě slovenského.
    Zajímavé je, že v podcastu není na samotné junior.guru, natož klub, jediná reklama, ale přesto si to lidé najdou.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Členové také dost zmiňují, že hledali recenze na kurzy a našli klub díky tomu.
    Všechny tyhle stránky, zvláště ta o &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/topics/greenfox/"&gt;Green Fox Academy&lt;/a&gt;, mají vysokou hledanost (to mi říká Google Search Console) a návštěvnost (to mi říkají &lt;a href="https://referral.simpleanalytics.com/honza-javorek"&gt;Simple Analytics&lt;/a&gt;).
    Je dost možné, že čím víc reklam a PR si vzdělávací agentury zaplatí, tím víc lidí organicky skončí na těchto mých stránkách.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lidi z firem mě celkem běžně zdraví stylem „já už vás delší dobu sleduji na LinkedIn“.
    Před pár týdny jsem si pro účely psaní tohoto článku poznačil, že mám na LinkedIn 2.140 sledujících.
    Než jsem to tu začal psát, mám jich 2.191.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takže přes podcast!
A hledáním na Google.
Tak mě najdou junioři, moje primární cílovka.
Spolupráce s firmami řeším prakticky výhradně skrze osobní kontakty.
Ty mě zase sledují na LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jak-jsem-si-vymyslel-strategii"&gt;Jak jsem si vymyslel strategii&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#jak-jsem-si-vymyslel-strategii" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co z toho všeho vyplývá?
Jak to tedy celé plánuji do budoucna?
Zatím je to, Honzo, hluboký a velice lidský příběh, ale kde je ta strategie slibovaná v titulku?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Rybičky z filmu Hledá se Nemo, které plavou v moři uvnitř plastových sáčků a nevědí co dál" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/ew-ofkowaaacf5z.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="zacnu-sbirat-zpetnou-vazbu"&gt;Začnu sbírat zpětnou vazbu&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#zacnu-sbirat-zpetnou-vazbu" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tak především, začnu se ptát lidí, odkud přišli.
Vymyslím ten nejjednodušší způsob, jak se jich hromadně ptát, a ten co nejdříve zrealizuji.
Žádné další výmluvy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když mi zbude energie, zkusím se jich ptát i na další věci.
Jak se vám líbila přednáška?
Které funkce klubu máte nejraději?
A tak dále.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="vylepsim-web"&gt;Vylepším web&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#vylepsim-web" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud junioři chodí z vyhledávače, tak bych se měl věnovat SEO a té části webu junior.guru, která se zabývá kurzy.
SEO škáluje.
Jedno odpoledne práce vydá na několik měsíců velké parády.
Sociální sítě jsou příliš pracné na to, aby plnily pouze roli novinek.
A web je navíc můj!
Tvořím tam svůj produkt na svojí doméně uprostřed svobodného internetu, nejsem produktem někoho jiného na cizí uzavřené platformě.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V první řadě chci vylepšit stránky o kurzech.
Mám nápad, jak by měly vypadat.
Vymyslím způsob, jak realizovat nějaké MVP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Další dlouho odkládaná věc je „diskuze“ pod stránkami v příručce.
Když někdo doscrolluje na konec stránky, měl by vidět výzvu, aby šel o tématu diskutovat do klubu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rozjedu-newsletter"&gt;Rozjedu newsletter&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#rozjedu-newsletter" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud chci na sítě dávat jen věci, které ocení hlavně lidi, kteří junior.guru už znají, tak je nejspíš mohu nahradit e-mailem.
Jak jsem psal výše, newsletter dřív na junior.guru byl a stačilo by jej obnovit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opět by šlo o něco, co by žilo na mé doméně, nezávisle na uzavřených platformách a algoritmech.
A mohl bych si pomoci automatizací, která je u sítí složitá.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="vykaslu-se-na-twitter-facebook-a-instagram"&gt;Vykašlu se na Twitter, Facebook a Instagram&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#vykaslu-se-na-twitter-facebook-a-instagram" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na základě dlouhodobé osobní frustrace jsem svůj Facebook, Twitter a Instagram „vyčistil“ a utlumil na minimum.
Kromě IG, kde jsem si profil prostě jen zamknul, jsem oznámil svým sledujícím, že tam už moc nebudu.
V současné chvíli je pro mě představitelnější, že si založím TikTok, než že se vrátím na Facebook.
Napsal jsem si to i na osobní web:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Moje další profily, jak jak je mám na osobním webu" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid figure-img rounded" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2022-12-01-at-20.49.57.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Můj blog mohou lidé odebírat přes RSS, případně mohou sledovat můj &lt;a href="https://t.me/honzajavorekcz"&gt;kanál na Telegramu&lt;/a&gt;. A budu pracovat na tom, aby do budoucna mohli nové články dostávat i e-mailem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pro junior.guru mám na Facebooku a Instagramu i firemní profily.
Ty časem přebuduji tak, aby na nich byl jen statický obsah, který bude lidi motivovat, aby odebírali junior.guru newsletter.
Až nebudu vědět co s penězi, možná si najmu někoho, kdo bude novinky z e-mailů kreativně přepisovat na sítě.
Spíš si ale myslím, že to prostě nebudu vůbec potřebovat.
Pokud budu mít něco velkého, nebo zajímavého i pro jiné komunity, klidně Facebook využiju a osobně s tím ospamuju skupiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kde budu sledovat novinky a zajímavosti já?
Možná zkusím víc číst knihy.
Nebo blogy, kde musel autor víc přemýšlet nad tím, co napíše.
Našel jsem si &lt;a href="https://netnewswire.com/"&gt;hezkou RSS čtečku&lt;/a&gt; a sleduji přes ni i pár Twitter účtů.
Nemožnost na tweety reagovat, nebo číst diskuzi pod nimi, je přímo osvobozující.
Pokud by mi to nestačilo, zkusím newslettery a Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="budu-mnohem-vic-vyuzivat-linkedin"&gt;Budu mnohem víc využívat LinkedIn&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#budu-mnohem-vic-vyuzivat-linkedin" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Svému LinkedIn profilu se hodlám aktivně věnovat.
Tedy tomu osobnímu.
Firemní profil tam dopadne nejspíš stejně, jako ten na Facebooku a Instagramu.
U toho osobního chci ještě promyslet, jak to pojmu.
Nechci ho plnit novinkami, ale něčím kvalitním a unikátním, co by tam mohlo lidi zajímat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nainstaloval jsem si LinkedIn aplikaci na mobil a poslechl jsem si &lt;a href="https://jaknasite.simplecast.com/episodes/jana-bartikova-tipy-a-triky-pro-linkedin-eeBSI5Wr"&gt;Tipy a triky pro LinkedIn od Jany Bártíkové&lt;/a&gt;.
Jana v podcastu zmiňuje, že nejvíc z této sítě těží lidé, kteří mají více jak 1.000 sledujících, což splňuji.
Mluví o článcích a newsletterech, takže možná bych mohl na profil nějak dostat i ty novinky.
Zaujala mě taky možnost dělat živé streamy nebo LinkedIn audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proč streamy?
Protože v klubu dělám přednášky a možná by je šlo do budoucna využít jako video obsah.
Třeba jen malé kousky, aby z toho byly upoutávky.
Už mám pomocníka na tvorbu záznamů přednášek.
Mohl by mi pomoci i s dalšími věcmi, které souvisí s videem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Náhled na můj LinkedIn profil" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid figure-img rounded" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2022-12-15-at-23-38-26.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="usporadam-qa"&gt;Uspořádám Q&amp;amp;A&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#usporadam-qa" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vlastně ale s těmi streamy a audiem nejde ani o ty přednášky, to by byl spíš bonus.
Už skoro rok slibuji &lt;a href="https://pyladies.cz/"&gt;PyLadies&lt;/a&gt;, že pro ně udělám online Q&amp;amp;A.
Videohovor, kde mi budou moci účastnice kurzů pokládat jakékoliv otázky.
Ačkoliv to nevyžaduje prakticky žádnou přípravu, nenašel jsem si na to čas.
Když jsem byl nedávno na kafi s &lt;a href="https://lucie.vaclavkova.com/"&gt;Lucií Václavkovou&lt;/a&gt; a vyprávěla mi, jak dělá svá Q&amp;amp;A, tak mi to najednou celé docvaklo.
Ten formát je úplně skvělý!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jedná se o mluvení.
    To mi jde a baví mě to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nevyžaduje to z mé strany žádnou speciální přípravu.
    Stačí najít vhodný termín.
    Dá se to dělat i pravidelně.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Člověk je v kontaktu s reálnými problémy a dotazy lidí.
    To mám sice díky klubu, ale není od věci rozšířit si obzory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kdybych Q&amp;amp;A dělal veřejně na YouTube nebo LinkedIn, doví se o mě velice relevantní cestou mnoho nových lidí.
    Přitom mě to skoro nic nestojí.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Když Q&amp;amp;A udělám pro PyLadies nebo Czechitas a další komunity, doví se o mě lidé z těchto skupin.
    Jsou to moje velké cílovky.
    Oslovím je nenásilnou cestou, při které z toho mají užitek obě strany.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Může to být stream, nebo z toho může být záznam.
    Objeví se ve výsledcích vyhledávání na YouTube a nasbírá časem &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail"&gt;long tail&lt;/a&gt;, podobně jako to umí podcasty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="budu-si-vybirat-aktivity-podle-efektivity"&gt;Budu si vybírat aktivity podle efektivity&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#budu-si-vybirat-aktivity-podle-efektivity" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celkově bych chtěl silně omezit věci, které vyžadují mnoho přípravy, mají malý efekt, nebo trpí dokonce obojím.
Před rokem jsem &lt;a href="https://www.heroine.cz/clanky/autor/70000223-honza-javorek"&gt;publikoval pro Heroine.cz&lt;/a&gt; a nelituji toho, ale stálo mě to hodně úsilí, které jsem nemohl věnovat junior.guru samotnému.
Přestal jsem takové věci dělat.
Stejně tak přednášky na srazech a konferencích.
Občas mě někdo ukecá, ale v zásadě mi to smysl moc nedává.
Mám byznys v jednom člověku a musím hledat největší efektivitu.
Tu mají věci jako podcasty a Q&amp;amp;A.
Tyto své preference jsem si už také dal na osobní web:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Možnosti spolupráce, jak jak je mám na osobním webu" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid figure-img rounded" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2022-12-01-at-21-03-20.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nemyslím si, že to někoho odradí.
Napsal jsem to tam hlavně pro sebe, abych to rozhodnutí někam vytesal a připomínalo se mi.
Možná by to mohlo někoho naopak motivovat, aby mě pozval na rozhovor, pokud si čte mou osobní stránku a váhá, zda mě oslovit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="dam-vic-lasky-podcastu"&gt;Dám víc lásky podcastu&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dam-vic-lasky-podcastu" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Další oblastí, kterou bych měl nějak podpořit, je &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/podcast/"&gt;Pavlínin podcast&lt;/a&gt;.
Měl bych se s ní sejít, nebo si s ní zavolat, abychom probrali, co pro ni můžu udělat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mohl bych se s ní dělit o nějaký zisk, aby měla finance na rozvoj a zlepšování svého vybavení.
Určitě by šlo podcast podpořit i lepší webovkou a profesionálnějšími promo obrázky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technické zázemí není žádná sláva a &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/liborvanekcz/"&gt;Libor Vaněk&lt;/a&gt; mi zajistil účet na &lt;a href="https://www.cdn77.com/"&gt;CDN77.com&lt;/a&gt;, tak bych měl podcast přesunout tam.
Nová infrastruktura bude nejen spolehlivější, ale umožní mi přímo u zdroje počítat, kolik lidí si kterou epizodu stáhlo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Webovka Junior Guru podcastu" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid figure-img rounded" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2022-12-15-at-23-42-03-podcast-pro-juniory-v-it.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="budu-nad-marketingem-dal-premyslet"&gt;Budu nad marketingem dál přemýšlet&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#budu-nad-marketingem-dal-premyslet" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nakonec, rozhodl jsem se, že si budu s &lt;a href="https://www.janadolejsova.cz/"&gt;Janou Dolejšovou&lt;/a&gt; domlouvat alespoň jednou ročně konzultaci.
Taková Stanice technické kontroly, kde probereme, co dělám, jak to dělám, a co bych možná dělat mohl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Někdo by mohl říct, že tohle přece není žádná marketingová strategie.
Kde je diagnóza?
Řídící principy?
Jenže já z toho asi nechci &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mHvqMF8_JcIa13t4NFHbI3d2rSF_PdiY4TyR4qeSTPU/edit#gid=0"&gt;dělat vědu&lt;/a&gt;.
Potřebuji akorát aby lidi chodili na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/club/"&gt;stránku o klubu&lt;/a&gt; a klikali tam na tlačítko.
Už teď tam přijde zhruba 250 až 350 unikátních návštěvníků měsíčně.
60 až 80 jich dojde až na Discord.
Přibližně 20 si začně klub platit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nepotřebuju výkonnou a dobře namazanou marketingovou mašinu.
Cílem této mojí „strategie“ je vlastně především snížit režii.
Změnit mix tak, abych měl víc času na jiné věci.
Nahradit pracné a na čase závislé věci jinými, které lépe škálují.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stále platí, že když vydělám na provoz rodiny, budu spokojený.
Pokud marketingem podpořím příchod členů do klubu tak, že vydělám i víc, budu moci nějaké peníze investovat zpět do junior.guru.
Vznikne víc hezkých věcí pro juniory!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jak-by-to-slo-vylepsovat"&gt;Jak by to šlo vylepšovat&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#jak-by-to-slo-vylepsovat" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To, co jsem tady sepsal, beru především jako úklid, směr, optimalizaci.
Představuji si, že jakmile budu hotov s touto fází, bude spousta věcí fungovat sama a já budu mít energii posouvat se ještě dál.
Přijdou na řadu věci jako aktivizace členů komunity, aby mi pomáhali, junior.guru doporučovali, nebo moje věci sdíleli dál.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Věc, kterou mohu zrealizovat relativně snadno, je výhoda pro členy, kteří klub doporučí dalším lidem.
Používám Memberful a ten &lt;a href="https://memberful.com/referrals/"&gt;na to má přímo funkci&lt;/a&gt;.
Stačí to vymyslet.
Napadá mě třeba, že by bot tento odkaz rozeslal lidem, kteří si klub už půl roku nebo rok platí.
Těm se tam nejspíš líbí.
Kdyby doporučili někoho, kdo si začne klub platit, mohli by dostat slevu, nebo jinou výhodu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pavlína mi před časem psala, že by možná k epizodám podcastu psala i nějaké texty.
Také jsem se domlouval s kamarádem, že pokud bude mít chuť, mohl by začít dělat rozhovory s juniory.
Na junior.guru není zatím žádný blog, ale mohl bych jej rozjet a tyto věci by tam mohly vycházet.
Celé by se to dalo propojit i s tím newsletterem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ne každému však vyhovuje čtení.
Audio mám pokryté podcastem, ale tím to nemusí končit.
Novinář Jakub Zelenka používá na svém projektu &lt;a href="https://mimo-agendu.ghost.io/"&gt;Mimo agendu&lt;/a&gt; službu &lt;a href="https://beyondwords.io/"&gt;BeyondWords&lt;/a&gt;.
Za pár korun to z českého textu vygeneruje poslouchatelnou audio verzi.
Tím se dá ekosystém podcastu, blogu a newsletteru vzájemně propojit.
Audioverzi může dostat i &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/handbook/"&gt;příručka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když už jsem u novinářů, pohrávám si ještě s jedním bláznivým nápadem.
Udělal bych na junior.guru stránku, kde bych shromažďoval &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1588147581544239104"&gt;hurá-do-IT články&lt;/a&gt; a psal k nim komentáře.
Podle mě by to mohlo začít kultivovat, co v novinách na téma juniorů v IT vychází.
Jen bych nerad, aby se mi to nějak vymstilo.
Asi bych tam neměl ty novináře úplně hejtit.
Spíš bych chtěl, aby mě začali vnímat jako rozumnou, nezávislou mluvící hlavu, která se ráda k tématu vyjádří.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jak-byste-to-delali-vy"&gt;Jak byste to dělali vy?&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#jak-byste-to-delali-vy" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tak, a jsme na konci.
Myslíte si, že jsem to promyslel dobře?

&lt;p&gt;Skoro měsíc bez týdenních poznámek! Ale jsem zpět. Dával jsem si akorát pauzu, a to v mnoha ohledech. Celé to začalo opakovaným &lt;em&gt;failem&lt;/em&gt; při nahrávání přednášek. Předělával jsem potom, jak celý blog funguje, a nechtěl jsem si práci komplikovat tím, že budu během toho vydávat poznámky. Místo jednoho týdne to trvalo snad tři. No a teď už jsem teda snad zpět a vrátím se k týdennímu rytmu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zaznamy-prednasek"&gt;Záznamy přednášek&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#zaznamy-prednasek" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Měli jsme v klubu představení mentorů z firmy Mews. Byla to náročná akce na provedení, protože jsem tam měl uvádět, sám vystupovat a sdílet obrazovku, ale přitom to celé i nahrát. Předtím se mi to však už jednou povedlo s představením mentorů z firmy Pure Storage, takže jsem si věřil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Jan z Mews na videu" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2022-12-09-at-18-05-24-jak-funguje-mentoring-a-uvitani-mentoru-z-mews.png" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hodně se mi líbilo, co jsme si tam říkali. Po akci jsem z toho celého měl fakt velkou radost, dopadlo to skvěle. O to větší bylo překvapení, když jsem zjistil, že ze záznamu je použitelný leda tak zvuk. Obraz se trhal zhruba jeden snímek za 5 minut. A to jak záznam na disk, tak stream na YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nejsem si vědom ničeho, co bych ten večer udělal špatně. Mám &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/event/"&gt;dlouhý seznam úkonů&lt;/a&gt;, podle kterého jedu jako astronaut při startu. Je tam velký prostor pro lidskou chybu, ale v tomto případě si jí nejsem vědom. Tím spíš byl výsledek zdrcující.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Byl to druhý záznam po sobě, který se mi nepovedl a propadl jsem velkému splínu. Reálně zas o tolik nešlo, ale prostě na mě dolehl dlouhodobější stres a frustrace ze své neschopnosti vyprodukovat použitelný záznam ani přesto, že se snažím vše vyladit, opravovat chyby, dokumentovat si kroky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nebyl jsem schopen pracovat na zjištění příčiny. Do dnešního dne pouze podezírám, že update macOS na Venturu &lt;a href="https://obsproject.com/forum/threads/ventura.160961/"&gt;mohl ovlivnit chování OBS&lt;/a&gt;. Ve skutečnosti jsem po akci nebyl schopen pracovat vůbec na ničem. Zmohl jsem se jen na výzvu v klubu, že bych uvítal pomoc se záznamy přednášek a že za to i zaplatím.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na tuto výzvu se mi (skrze svého bráchu) ozval jeden bývalý člen klubu, Tinuki. Dohodli jsme se a přednášku o Javě od &lt;a href="https://blog.zvestov.cz/"&gt;Luboše Račanského&lt;/a&gt; už nahrával on. To byla nádhera! Vše předem vyzkoušel, vše se povedlo. Já se soustředil „jen“ na to, abych speakera uvedl, moderoval otázky a odpovědi, atd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Luboš Račanský na videu" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2022-12-09-at-18-05-33-lubos-racansky-posudme-javu-podle-obalu.png" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vzápětí byl v klubu záznam, povedený a ve skvělé kvalitě. Takže to má &lt;em&gt;happy end&lt;/em&gt; a já mám prvního placeného spolupracovníka, pokud nepočítám právničku a daňaře. Akorát musím nastudovat, jak přesně funguje &lt;a href="https://www.jakpodnikat.cz/dohoda-provedeni-prace.php"&gt;DPP&lt;/a&gt; nebo &lt;a href="https://www.jakpodnikat.cz/dohoda-pracovni-cinnosti.php"&gt;DPČ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud by se stalo, že záznam někdy nevyjde, výsledek bude stejný, jako kdybych to pokazil já. Prostě se za to omluvím členům klubu. Budu s tím mít ale mnohem méně práce a stresu. Tentokrát jsem ještě stres měl, ale podle mě jen proto, že to bylo poprvé v této sestavě. Cítil jsem se, jako bych opouštěl byt a neměl peněženku, mobil a klíče. Nikde žádné OBS, žádné nastavování audia a videa. Byl to zvláštní pocit, ale vlastně krásný. Těšil jsem se, že přesně takto by to mohlo probíhat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tímhle způsobem jsem schopen přednášky jako moderátor „obsloužit“ pomalu i jen z Discord aplikace na mobilu a se sluchátky, téměř z jakkoliv nekvalitního internetu. Moje nezávislost a duševní pohoda se tímto krokem výrazně zlepší, aniž bych musel přednášky v klubu rušit (což je alternativní řešení).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pauza-uklid-a-jomo"&gt;Pauza, úklid a JOMO&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#pauza-uklid-a-jomo" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krize, která na mě dolehla se zkaženým záznamem akce s Mews, se mi spojila s mnoha dalšími pocity. Čtení mírně nihilistické knihy &lt;a href="https://www.oliverburkeman.com/books"&gt;Four Thousand Weeks&lt;/a&gt;. Nedostatek dovolené. Podezření na ADHD. Neschopnost programovat tak, abych efektivně doručoval změny na JG. Dlouhodobá deziluze ze sociálních sítí.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V rámci „terapie“, nebo možná prostě jen eskapismu, jsem se pustil hned druhý den po akci v klubu do přebudovávání svého blogu. Mimo nejnutnější věci jsem po několik týdnů nedělal nic, co by souviselo s JG. I tak toho tedy bylo dost. Zbytek času jsem kompletně věnoval přebudovávání osobní webovky, ať už co se týče designu nebo obsahu. Více jsem o tom &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/zmeny-na-blogu/"&gt;napsal v samostatném článku&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nakonec jsem jel s dobrým kamarádem na víkend do Krkonoš, kde jsme si téměř kontinuálně povídali o životě a omylem u toho vylezli na Sněžku, &lt;a href="https://www.novinky.cz/clanek/pocasi-vrchol-snezky-zasahl-orkan-40416399"&gt;jen pár hodin před orkánem&lt;/a&gt;. Cestu tam a zpět jsem strávil čtením Four Thousand Weeks a čištěním hlavy. Různé chvilky jsem věnoval tomu, abych si přesunul osobní úkoly z Trella do Apple Notes, zrušil Pocket nebo výrazně utlumil svůj Facebook, Twitter a Instagram. Digitální úklid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Výhled ze Sněžky na peřinu mračen" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/img-0754.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Věci, které chci sledovat, jsem si dal do &lt;a href="https://netnewswire.com/"&gt;RSS čtečky&lt;/a&gt;, která umí sledovat i Twitter účty. Pár jsem si jich nechal, např. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/"&gt;Levelse&lt;/a&gt; nebo účet &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TomBorovsk1"&gt;Tomáše Borovského&lt;/a&gt;, můj oblíbený středověký kousek internetu. Je osvobozující číst jen tweety a nevidět diskuzi pod nimi. Nemít možnost na nic klikat, odpovědět, lajkovat. Jak to popsal Oliver Burkeman v tom Four Thousand Weeks, místo FOMO (&lt;em&gt;fear of missing out&lt;/em&gt;) si užívat &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1600421050138775552"&gt;JOMO&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;joy of missing out&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Účty na sociálních sítích jsem záměrně nezrušil, protože tam hodlám čas od času jít. Nemá to být &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Pilgrim#%22Disappearance%22_from_the_Internet"&gt;&lt;em&gt;infosuicide&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, jen úklid, vyjádření preference a přesměrování své energie jinam. Z oněch třech sítí jsem se však na všech zařízeních odhlásil. Připadá vám to jako popis nějaké odvykačky? Možná to tak je :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jak teď budu řešit propagaci byznysu? Rozvedu to v samostatném článku tady na blogu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="prilis-mnoho-psani-do-klubu"&gt;Příliš mnoho psaní do klubu&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#prilis-mnoho-psani-do-klubu" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan, můj klubový parťák a moderátor, se snadno nechá strhnout k pomáhání úplně každému, na koho narazí. Řešili jsme spolu, že je možná až moc aktivní, což nemusí být nutně dobře ani pro klub, ani pro něj.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Já sám jsem záměrně trochu polevil na své aktivitě, protože chci vytvořit víc prostoru pro ostatní. Chci, aby se bavili mezi sebou a pomáhali si, ne aby jen čekali na to, co napíšu já. Občas se to daří. Hledám hranice, kdy je užitečné reagovat, a kdy počkat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myslím, že u Dana je to složitější, protože je diskutujícím „řadovým členem“ se zájmem o frontend, pozorným moderátorem a navíc má &lt;a href="https://coreskill.tech/"&gt;CoreSkill&lt;/a&gt;, byznys přímo související s tím, co se v klubu probírá. Zajímá jej vlastně vše a dokáže se vyjádřit ke všemu a (dobře) poradit se vším. Ale potom je ho všude plno, což nemusí vyhovovat každému a nevytváří to prostor pro vzájemné interakce. Také tím tráví čas, který by měl trávit svým podnikáním nebo relaxací.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probírali jsme to interně ze všech stran a dlouhodobě udržitelné řešení zatím spíš hledáme. Pár nápadů máme a minimálně je už teď hodnotná i ta zpětná vazba a uvědomění si, že se to děje.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když mají lidi prostor, je fajn sledovat, jak dokážou fungovat i samostatně a vzájemně si pomáhat. Ať už je to Advent of Code, nebo komentování sdílených projektů a nahraných CVček.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="channels-roles"&gt;Channels &amp;amp; Roles&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#channels-roles" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jednoho dne jsem se probudil a Discord přidal novou funkci, které já říkám &lt;em&gt;Channels &amp;amp; Roles&lt;/em&gt; a oni jí nejspíš říkají &lt;em&gt;Onboarding&lt;/em&gt;. Nevěřil jsem vlastním očím. Vánoce!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Onboarding" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2022-12-09-at-17-33-45.png" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figure-caption"&gt;

Nastavení otázek, které mohu pokládat členům klubu, a podle nichž jim mohu zobrazovat kanály nebo přidělovat role&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delší dobu jsem se zvětšující se komunitou pozoroval, jak určité věci na Discordu neškálují. A to mám prosím 400 lidí, ne 40.000, jako jiné Discord servery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Například zmatek v kanálech, nemožnost aby se lidi snadno sami přidali do zájmových skupin, apod. Dlouhodobě jsem uvažoval, že tohle bude něco, co budu muset naprogramovat do svého bota, ale jednak jsem za tím viděl mnoho práce, jednak jsem si nebyl jistý tím, jak přesně by to mělo produktově fungovat, a dokonce jsem viděl i technické překážky kvůli limitům Discordu, a nevěděl jsem, jak je ideálně překonat. To celé udržovalo řešení v kategorii „možná, někdy“. Problémy však pokračovaly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Channels &amp;amp; Roles" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2022-12-09-at-17-34-52.png" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figure-caption"&gt;
Takhle to pak vypadá z pohledu uživatele. Prostě si nakliká, kde chce být a co ho zajímá&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No a oni to prostě jednoho dne udělali. Oni vytvořili přesně tu věc, co jsem potřeboval! Líp bych to ani nevymyslel. Mohl jsem si okamžitě škrtnout tak 20 až 30 Trello kartiček. Sice jsem pak půl dne strávil tím, abych to nastavil, ale to už byla vyloženě radost. Přeskupil jsem kanály, přidal nějaké nové, zkusil v něčem i trochu experimentovat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Počkám, až si to trochu sedne a až si lidi naklikají témata, která je zajímají. Umím si pak představit, že když někdo založí téma např. na Python a nebude na něj tři dny žádná odpověď, bot tam automaticky označí nadšence do Pythonu, aby si toho všimli. Stejně tak posouzení CVček apod. Už se těším, co za parádu mi tohle umožní dělat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V tomhle je Discord skvělý. Stále více vyniká, jak se orientuje na komunity a jsou pro něj prioritou zcela jiné funkce, než např. pro Slack, který řeší spíš komunikaci „akčních týmů“, ať už jde o firmu nebo neziskovku. Jsem rád, že jsem s JG na začátku dobře přečetl situaci a vybral správně.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teď dokonce &lt;a href="https://discord.com/blog/server-and-creator-subscriptions"&gt;zavádějí placené Discord servery&lt;/a&gt;, pro začátek jen pro USA. Nemám v úmyslu opouštět &lt;a href="https://memberful.com/"&gt;Memberful&lt;/a&gt;, protože má pro mě důležité funkce, ale pro nějaké jednodušší případy to může být úžasný způsob, jak si lusknutím prstu založit komunitu podporovatelů.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Účastnil jsem se živého natáčení podcastu &lt;a href="https://www.programhrovani.cz/1843229/11814222-o-skalovani-tymu-v-engineeringu-s-dagim"&gt;ProgramHRování&lt;/a&gt; s Dagim jako hostem, které se konalo v Ataccamě. Potkal jsem tam k mému překvapení dost lidí, které jsem znal a byla to sranda. Na pivu po akci jsme probírali hlavně podcasty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Byl jsem na kafi s &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukaskonarovsky/"&gt;Lukášem&lt;/a&gt; z Fakturoidu a řešili jsme byznys, růst, spolupracovníky, marketing, no prostě všechno možné.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Viděl jsem se krátce se &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/msvetlana/"&gt;Svetlanou&lt;/a&gt; a půjčil jsem jí knížku.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Byl jsem na pivu s autory &lt;a href="https://zorin.com/"&gt;Zorin OS&lt;/a&gt; a řešili jsme život a české vánoční zvyky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Byl jsem na pivu s &lt;a href="https://tomasvotruba.com/"&gt;Tomášem&lt;/a&gt; a řešili jsme byznys a život.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volal jsem si s &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/martin-durina/"&gt;Martinem&lt;/a&gt;, komunitním manažerem &lt;a href="https://ajtyvit.sk/"&gt;Aj ty v IT&lt;/a&gt;, a sdíleli jsme zkušenosti z vedení komunit na Discordu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Byl jsem na obědě s &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/juhamattisantala/"&gt;Juhou&lt;/a&gt; z Mozilly a řešili jsme spolu, jak mají dobrosrdeční geekové vydělávat peníze, i když je jim to proti srsti. I já s tím stále bojuji.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volal jsem si se zbytkem výboru &lt;a href="https://pyvec.org/"&gt;Pyvce&lt;/a&gt;. Schválili jsme jeden malý grant a diskutovali jsme, jak budeme v budoucnu řešit volby, aby se neopakovaly chyby z minula.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volal jsem si s &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marianhurta/"&gt;Marianem&lt;/a&gt; z ENGETO Academy. Ukazoval mi novinku, kterou budou brzo spouštět.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volal jsem si s &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-rajnoha-a62453168/"&gt;Davidem Rajnohou&lt;/a&gt; z &lt;a href="https://tourdeapp.cz/"&gt;Tour de App&lt;/a&gt; a řešili jsme, jak jim mohu pomoci.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi"&gt;Další&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Autorizoval jsem svůj rozhovor pro &lt;a href="https://restarty.dev/"&gt;(re)štarty v IT&lt;/a&gt;. Brzo by to mělo vyjít. Je to snad nejosobnější rozhovor, který jsem kdy s kým natočil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sbíral jsem zpětnou vazbu na pohovory nanečisto s Ataccamou, dvoudenní akci (online i prezenční), kterou jsme pro juniory uspořádali spolu s &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/%C5%A1%C3%A1rka-kousalov%C3%A1/"&gt;Šárkou Kousalovou&lt;/a&gt; a jejím týmem. Lidi si to fakt hodně pochvalovali a mnohým to zvedlo sebevědomí!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zjišťoval jsem, jak by mohli lidé odebírat tento blog e-mailem. Hledal jsem nějakou RSS-to-email službu, ale k mému překvapení jsem nic jednoduchého nenašel. Hrál jsem si chvíli s Ghostem, Substackem, MailChimpem, nebo Zapierem, ale nic z toho nedělalo to, co chci, nebo jsem na to nepřišel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přemýšlel jsem, jak můžu vylepšit formát těchto poznámek, případně je zkrátit. Rád bych, aby byly poznámky údernější a abych nosnější témata z poznámek vydával jako separátní články. V poznámkách totiž zaniknou a prodlužují je. Tentokrát se mi to ale asi nepodaří, když popisuju skoro měsíc událostí. Zatím jsem akorát přestal poznámky číslovat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poprvé jsem přispěl do pycordu i jinak než jen založením issue. Mergnuli mi &lt;a href="https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord/pull/1782"&gt;tento Pull Request&lt;/a&gt;! Mažu v něm tři slova, všiml jsem si neaktualizované dokumentace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ceremoniálně jsem v klubu spustil &lt;a href="https://adventofcode.com/"&gt;Advent of Code&lt;/a&gt;. Máme na to speciální kanál a roli s vánočními stromečky. Já nemám čas se účastnit, ale členové v klubu jedou jak draci, diskutují řešení, chlubí se, radí si. Je radost to sledovat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Programoval jsem nějaké věci, které asi nemá smysl tady rozepisovat. Mělo to něco společného s &lt;a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/"&gt;click&lt;/a&gt;em, &lt;a href="https://github.com/pallets/click/issues/1124#issuecomment-653238970"&gt;konfigurací subcommandů&lt;/a&gt; a nejrůznějšími opravami podivných chyb.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Byl jsem na čtvrté dávce očkování proti covidu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slíbil jsem, že pěti týmům z &lt;a href="https://tourdeapp.cz/"&gt;Tour de App&lt;/a&gt; daruji do soutěže roční vstupné do klubu. Několika lidem jsem poslal osobní zprávu, zda nemají chuť &lt;a href="https://tourdeapp.cz/mentoring"&gt;mentorovat pro Tour de App&lt;/a&gt; a nasdílel jsem to na několik míst.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přidával jsem mentory do klubového mentoringového programu. Pokud se lidi představili na nějaké klubové akci, dal jsem k nim odkaz na konkrétní minutu záznamu na YouTube, kde se představují.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Udělal jsem v klubu soutěž o tři lístky na &lt;a href="https://prague-2022.devrelcon.dev/"&gt;DevRelCon&lt;/a&gt;, který mi darovalo Kiwi.com. Už mi jeden z výherců psal, že si konferenci náramně užil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zadal jsem kamarádovi, aby zkusil začít dělat rozhovory s úspěšnými juniory z klubu. Dal jsem mu tipy na pár z nich a zatím čekám, jestli z něj něco vypadne. Pokud by to bylo použitelné, platil bych za to. Součástí dohody jsou nulová očekávání z obou stran, takže třeba z něj ani nic nevypadne.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zjišťoval jsem u daňaře, jak je to s výdajovými paušály a co by to znamenalo stát se identifikovanou osobou (tzn. řešit DPH pro zahraničí a být schopen nakupovat služby atd. z EU, ale zůstat neplátce DPH pro ČR). Nakonec by to možná nemuselo být tak hrozné, zvlášť s &lt;a href="https://www.fakturoid.cz/"&gt;Fakturoidem&lt;/a&gt;. Proč to řeším? Docela dobře to popsali &lt;a href="https://saneto.cz/proc-byt-identifikovanou-osobou/"&gt;tady&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vyčistil jsem si &lt;a href="https://www.revolut.com/"&gt;Revolut&lt;/a&gt;. Nevím, jestli ho chci dál používat. Používal jsem ho na rychlé platby přátelům, ale to už dnes jde jednodušeji a rychleji přes QR kódy a „Pay me“ odkazy. A pak také při cestování, ale teď nikam necestuji. Kdysi jsem něco potřeboval vyřešit na podpoře a jejich chatbot mě „přesvědčil“, že na Revolutu nechci raději nikdy mít obnos, na kterém mi záleží. Takže co se týče emocí, jsem nakloněn Revolut nepoužívat, pokud pro to nemám dobrý důvod. Aktualizoval jsem si účet u &lt;a href="https://wise.com/"&gt;Wise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Koukal jsem na chybu, která způsobuje, že se inzerentům neposílá pravidelný e-mail se statistikami. Zatím jsem to nevyřešil. Nikdo si zatím nestěžoval.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odpovídání v klubu, koukání na CVčka, e-maily, &lt;a href="https://docs.pyvec.org/operations/support.html#sit-kontaktu"&gt;Pyvec Slack&lt;/a&gt;, atd. Upgradování závislostí na vlastních i Pyvec projektech (zpracovávání Pull Requestů, které průběžně posílá Dependabot). Propagoval jsem na sociálních sítích přednášku v klubu a &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/podcast/"&gt;novou epizodu našeho podcastu&lt;/a&gt;. Řešil jsem stipendia. Řešil jsem u několika lidí problémy s přístupem do klubu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aktualizoval jsem všechny screenshoty, které se používají jako náhledy v rozcestnících na webu JG. Mám na to vyladěný skript a bylo skvělé jednou spustit věc, kterou jsem dřív naprogramoval, a zjistit, že fakt funguje.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 29 dní od 11. 11. do 9. 12. jsem naběhal 8 km, při procházkách nachodil 4 km, na túrách nachodil 32 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 11 hodin a zdolal při tom 44 kilometrů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finanční výsledky, návštěvnost a další čísla k JG &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;mám přímo na webu&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Zatáhl jsem za ruční brzdu a teď se potřebuji rozjet. Nebudu pokračovat v rozdělaných věcech, ale v úklidu:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Napíšu na blog, jak to do budoucna vidím se svým přístupem k sociálním sítím a marketingu na nich.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vydám na blogu strategii na rok 2023. Nebude to nic světoborného, prostě se jen zamyslím a sepíšu si, na co se chci v různých oblastech soustředit. Možná bych si mohl dát i nějaké cíle!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vymyslím a seženu vánoční dárky.&lt;/li&gt;

A dokonce navazuje na Zelenku: „Ačkoli si toho drtivá většina lidí není vědoma, stal se v Česku Twitter snad nejtoxičtější sociální sítí. Z prostého důvodu. Má zde přes milion aktivních uživatelů, z nichž drtivá většina žije v Praze a několika málo dalších velkých městech. Tak koncentrovaná skupina je vysněným terčem politických marketérů.”&lt;/li&gt;

A nejsou spíš jen vybíravé?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Skvěle napsaný a velmi přínosný článek demýtizující tzv. confidence gap: Že mužům stačí splnit 60 % požadavků v pracovním inzerátu a už se hlásí, zatímco ženy se nepřihlásí, dokud nemají 100 %. Text poskytuje zdroj statistiky, podrobnější rozbor problému, návrhy toho, co mohou firmy dělat. Ženy „…jsou trochu soudnější a zdrženlivější než muži. Nechtějí trávit čas a energii někde, kde nevěří, že můžou uspět.” Budu muset opravit příručku! Mnoho z věcí zmíněných v článku navíc platí i pro juniory v IT. Například popsat jasně a jednoznačně věci, které firma vyžaduje, a které jsou bonus, to je problém většiny juniorních nabídek.&lt;/li&gt;

Detailně popsané procesy jsou kamarád, včetně checklistů pro opuštění bytu. Kalendář je kamarád. Tabulky jsou kamarád. Rituály jsou kamarád.

Ke konci píše, že Twitter by měl být spíš centralizovaný než decentralizovaný, ale jako Wikipedia, jako nějaká „foundation“. Tentýž nápad jsem už zaznamenal dřív u Davida Antoše. Škoda, že se to asi nikdy nestane.&lt;/li&gt;

Raději knihu? Zároveň ale na sociálních sítích do jisté míry potřebuji být, abych propagoval svoje podnikání - byť ne tolik jako novináři.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kdybych se snažil prorazit na celosvětovém trhu, asi by mělo smysl blog postupně posouvat blíž a blíž k angličtině jako k hlavnímu jazyku. Moje podnikání je ale pouze pro ty, kdo rozumí česky, a tak sem každý týden píšu v češtině týdenní poznámky, které nyní tvoří většinu obsahu zde vydaného.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celkem je tady přes 500 článků a anglicky je jich 16. I většina všeho ostatního, co kde dělám, je v češtině, např. vystupování v podcastech nebo publikování v médiích. Moje publikum je prostě české, případně slovenské.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Velkou změnou na blogu je tedy rezignace na angličtinu jako výchozí jazyk. Neříkám, že občas nenapíšu anglický článek, ale výchozím jazykem bude čeština. Moje osobní stránka bude česky a úvodní stránka blogu taky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minule jsem psal o tom, že tradiční název blogu, &lt;strong&gt;Javorové lístky&lt;/strong&gt;, zahazuji, a bude to prostě &lt;strong&gt;HJ's blog&lt;/strong&gt;. Tak teď se vracím k tradici! Javorové lístky jsou zpět :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uspechy-a-nejvetsi-pecky"&gt;Úspěchy a největší pecky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#uspechy-a-nejvetsi-pecky" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na své osobní stránce i na hlavní stránce blogu jsem vypíchl nějaké hlavní věci, o které by se lidi měli zajímat, když sem přijdou. Na mé osobní stránce je takhle několik mých kariérních milníků a úspěchů.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Moje úspěchy" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid figure-img rounded" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2022-12-01-at-20.42.16.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Je tady archiv všech článků, ale tím se asi nikdo probírat nebude. Označil jsem si tedy interně některé články jako „největší pecky“, jejichž seznam je hned nahoře.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Největší pecky" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid figure-img rounded" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2022-12-01-at-20.41.17.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Na úvodní stránce webu jsem dal v záhlaví odkazy na pár míst, kde mě lidi mohou najít, ale dost jsem to osekal. Mám v plánu se totiž trochu stáhnout z některých sociálních sítí. Profily si nebudu rušit, protože se mi mohou občas hodit, ať už pro přístup k informacím, nebo pro občasnou propagaci svého podnikání.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O tom, kde hodlám být aktivní, a kde ne, jsem se pak rozepsal ve speciálním odstavci. Jestli to tak budu opravdu dodržovat, to je samozřejmě zatím ve hvězdách :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Moje další profily" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid figure-img rounded" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2022-12-01-at-20.49.57.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Napadlo mě, že bych mohl mít na webu přímo sekci, která vysvětluje můj aktuální přístup k nejrůznějším aktivitám, se kterými mě lidi sem tam oslovují. Cílem je, aby to některé odradilo a některé třeba zase povzbudilo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Možnosti spolupráce" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid figure-img rounded" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2022-12-01-at-21-03-20.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Úvodní stránka blogu nyní začíná dlouhým textem, který popisuje jeho historii. U nikoho jiného jsem nic takového neviděl. Původně jsem chtěl napsat dvě věty, ale nějak mi to přerostlo v delší text. Nakonec se mi to ale zalíbilo. Blog s patnáctiletou historií si pěkný úvod prostě zaslouží. Zkracovat to nebudu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lidi se většinou přes sdílené odkazy dostanou na konkrétní články. Na hlavní stránku blogu podle mě moc nechodí. Když už tam zabloudí, nejspíš je zajímá, kde se ocitli, a budou mít možná chuť si o tom trochu přečíst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Úvodní stránka blogu" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid figure-img rounded" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2022-12-01-at-21-04-10.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V minulém designu blogu byl odkaz na hlavní stránku blogu hodně potlačen. Teď jsem jej dal viditelně doprava nahoru, tak třeba tam zabloudí lidí víc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Odkaz na blog" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid figure-img rounded" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2022-12-01-at-21-05-09.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cas-cteni"&gt;Čas čtení&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#cas-cteni" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stává se mi, že napíšu článek a je strašně dlouhý. Někdy to za to stojí, někdy ne. Například nemá smysl, aby čtení mých týdenních poznámek někomu zabralo 20 minut. Nehledě na to, že jejich psaní mi pak zabere půl dne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abych měl trochu představu, zda jsem to s psaním nepřehnal, obohatil jsem svůj &lt;a href="https://getpelican.com/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; o plugin, který pro každý článek vypočítá čas čtení. Ten se pak zobrazuje v záhlaví každého článku.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;WORDS_PER_MINUTE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;words_count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;re&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sa"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'\s+'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;article_text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;readtime&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ceil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;words_count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;WORDS_PER_MINUTE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pomohl mi &lt;a href="https://www.craigabbott.co.uk/blog/how-to-calculate-reading-time-like-medium"&gt;tento článek&lt;/a&gt;. Testoval jsem to a přijde mi, že minimálně mojí rychlosti čtení to zhruba odpovídá.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="navstevnost"&gt;Návštěvnost&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#navstevnost" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do záhlaví každého článku jsem přidal také odkaz na grafy s návštěvností, které mám už nějakou dobu veřejně na &lt;a href="https://referral.simpleanalytics.com/honza-javorek"&gt;Simple Analytics&lt;/a&gt;. Odkaz se generuje tak, aby zobrazil návštěvnost pro tu konkrétní stránku na mém blogu, od data vydání článku.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Návštěvnost článku Volím marketing" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2022-12-01-at-21-13-53-simple-analytics-the-privacy-first-google-analytics-alternative.png" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Návštěvnost moc nesleduju, ale někdy mě zajímá u konkrétních článků. Vyfiltrovat si je rucně v Simple Analytics byla trochu pruda. Tak třeba když teď budu mít odkaz, tak se na to budu dívat častěji.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="telegram-misto-pocketu-a-socialnich-siti"&gt;Telegram místo Pocketu a sociálních sítí&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#telegram-misto-pocketu-a-socialnich-siti" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jsem aktuálně uprostřed něčeho jako digitálního úklidu. Zamýšlím se nad tím, které sociální sítě už mi přijdou tak toxické a neužitečné, že je opustím. Vyčistil jsem si seznam podcastů nebo subredditů, které chci sledovat. Čtu &lt;a href="https://www.oliverburkeman.com/books"&gt;Four Thousand Weeks&lt;/a&gt; a přemýšlím, jak moc věcí v mém životě jsou nekonečné seznamy „úkolů“ a zda s tím mohu něco udělat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jedna z prvních věcí, kterou jsem se rozhodl „zabít“, je &lt;a href="https://getpocket.com/"&gt;Pocket&lt;/a&gt;. Nainstaloval jsem si místo toho &lt;a href="https://netnewswire.com/"&gt;RSS čtečku&lt;/a&gt;, kam jsem si dal některé oblíbené zdroje. Když narazím na náhodné články, které mi přijdou zajímavé, čtu si je jednoduše v prohlížeči. Využívám při tom &lt;em&gt;Reader View&lt;/em&gt; ve Firefoxu nebo v Safari, které mi čtení zpříjemňuje. A když si článek přečíst nezvládnu, zapadne prostě v mých tabech v prohlížeči a možná ho pak jen zavřu. A bude mi to jedno. Aspoň tak si myslím, že by to teď mohlo fungovat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenže co s funkcí sdílení zajímavých článků? Upřímně, některé věci jsem stejně do Pocketu posílal jen uměle, abych je pak mohl vysdílet a objevily se v poznámkách. Například podcasty. Stačilo by mi něco, kam prostě hodím odkaz, když mě zaujme, a potom ty odkazy nějak automaticky sesbírám při psaní týdenních poznámek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sledoval jsem chvíli na Telegramu kanál &lt;a href="https://t.me/FilipHorky"&gt;Filipa Horkého&lt;/a&gt; (na který jsem narazil na Discordu projektu &lt;a href="https://mimo-agendu.ghost.io/"&gt;Mimo agendu&lt;/a&gt;) a přišlo mi, že by to mohlo být celkem zajímavé řešení. Založil jsem si tedy &lt;a href="https://t.me/honzajavorekcz"&gt;Honza Javorek sdílí&lt;/a&gt; a zatím se mi to líbí. Pro mě je to takhle navíc pohodlné, protože Telegram používám denně. Mám tam nejvíc kontaktů mezi přáteli i rodinou.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Kanál na Telegramu" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2022-12-01-at-22-24-53.png" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Napsal jsem si skript, který nové články na blogu přes GitHub Actions automaticky hodí do toho mého kanálu. Toto třeba s osobním Facebookovým profilem vůbec nejde a musel jsem tam odkazy dávat vždy ručně.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nakonec jsem obohatil skript, který mi připravuje šablonu článku pro týdenní poznámky, aby se na ten kanál podíval, co jsem od minule sdílel, a vložil odkazy do patičky poznámek. Stejně, jako to dřív bylo s Pocketem. Hotovo :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pocket má mimochodem vtipný &lt;a href="https://getpocket.com/export"&gt;export dat&lt;/a&gt;. Vyjede prostě jeden dlouhý HTML soubor s odkazy na věci, které jste si uložili.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="komentare"&gt;Komentáře&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#komentare" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lidi si občas stěžovali, že nemám na blogu komentáře. Myslel jsem, že budu prostě dostávat reakce na sociálních sítích a přímo tady nic být nemusí. Ale jak se chci ze sítí stáhnout a být na nich méně závislý, hledal jsem, zda by nemohlo existovat nějaké jiné řešení. Třeba aspoň něco, co by využívalo věci, které používat chci. Telegram, Discord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A zjistil jsem, že Telegramové kanály umožňují mít pod každou zprávou i komentáře. Tak jsem to zapnul. A pak přišel velký objev. Tyhle komentáře jde i přímo vložit na web! Propojil jsem to tedy s blogem úplně a pod článkem teď bude mít každý článek brzy po svém publikování tlačítko, které Telegramové komentáře načte. Kdo má účet na Telegramu, může je tam dokonce rovnou i psát. Kdo nechce psát, může dávat aspoň palce nahoru a jiné reakce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Komentáře na Telegramu" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2022-12-01-at-22-31-15.png" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nechtěl jsem, aby se komentáře načítaly automaticky, protože je to externí služba (pomalu se to načítá, nezapadá to do designu webu, může to sledovat uživatele), takže je to na tlačítko. Vyžádalo si to zhruba 12 řádků JavaScriptu a je to jediný JavaScript, který na tomto webu teď mám.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Komentáře na webu" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid figure-img rounded" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2022-12-01-at-22-32-16.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-clanky"&gt;Další články&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-clanky" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sice jsem přidal odkaz na úvodní stránku blogu do hlavičky každého článku, ale přišlo mi to nějak málo. Pod každý článek jsem tedy dal sekci s odkazy na další moje články. Je to opět můj vlastní plugin do Pelicanu. Články se vybírají podle magického algoritmu, jehož recepturu nikdy nikde neodhalím!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Upoutávka na další články" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2022-12-01-at-22-34-22.png" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="reklama-na-juniorguru"&gt;Reklama na junior.guru&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#reklama-na-juniorguru" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeden z důvodů, proč jsem si chtěl předělat web, bylo odstranění odkazů na GitHub Sponsors nebo Patreon z patičky článků a aktualizace prezentace mojí osoby. Moje podnikání, &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/"&gt;junior.guru&lt;/a&gt;, se za tři roky existence posunulo a myslím si, že už by mělo být schopné normálně vydělávat. Pokud nevydělá, měl bych to řešit jako podnikatel. Lidi o dobrovolné příspěvky žádat už nechci, byť mi v rozjezdu hodně pomohly a vážím si jich. Pod články jsem nově dal zcela přímočarou reklamu na junior.guru, která by mohla mít ten správný efekt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Upoutávka na junior.guru" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/screenshot-2022-12-01-at-22-43-45.png" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zjednodusene-vkladani-obrazku"&gt;Zjednodušené vkládání obrázků&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#zjednodusene-vkladani-obrazku" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K mnoha změnám na blogu mě inspiroval &lt;a href="https://www.lukasaugusta.cz/tydenni-zurnal"&gt;Lukáš Augusta&lt;/a&gt;. A dokonce se shodou náhod taky rozhodl předělávat si vlastní web:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure figure-blockquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na můj osobní web chodí dost lidí a je škoda, že tam o Landing page odshora až dolů™ není ani zmínka. Proto jsem se rozhodnul vytvořit nový web a souběžně s tím aktualizovat, čemu se věnuji a třeba doplnit portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption class="blockquote-footer"&gt; Lukáš Augusta, &lt;a href="https://www.lukasaugusta.cz/tydenni-zurnal/13-prvni-premysleni-nad-propagaci-rozboru-webu"&gt;#13: První přemýšlení nad propagací rozborů webů&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jedna z věcí, které se mi u něj líbily, bylo časté využívání obrázků v článcích. Lukáš je designer, tak má přirozeně blíž k tomu, aby místo tisíce slov použil jeden obrázek. Mě by to taky neuškodilo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proč vlastně obrázky běžně do článků nedávám? Protože je to pruda. Abych nacpal obrázek do staticky generovaného blogu běžícího na Markdownu a Pelicanu, je to strašně moc kroků. Stáhnout. Dát na správné místo. Zmenšit. Odkázat správně z Makrownu. Uf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Řekl jsem si, že udělám vše proto, aby bylo vložení obrázků co nejjednodušší. Co třeba &lt;em&gt;Drag &amp;amp; Drop&lt;/em&gt;? Šlo by to nějak? Šlo. Stačilo trochu hledat a zjistil jsem, že &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYoZ9QHM-uU"&gt;VS Code přímo podporuje přetažení obrázku do Markdownu&lt;/a&gt;, jen je potřeba při tom podržet &lt;kbd&gt;Shift&lt;/kbd&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vloží se ale s cestami, které povedou buď někam na internet, nebo někam jinam na můj disk. Vytvořil jsem tedy ještě skript, který projde soubory a hledá v nich takto vložené obrázky. Když na nějaký narazí, „vcucne“ ho do blogu. Nakopíruje na správné místo, zmenší, opraví cestu ve zdrojovém souboru.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Povedlo se mi zjednodušit bariéru pro nahrávání obrázků do článků? Posuďte sami :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tydenni-poznamky"&gt;Týdenní poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#tydenni-poznamky" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zvažuji, že přestanu týdenní poznámky číslovat, ale zatím jsem to nezrušil. Už nevím, proč jsem je číslovat začal a nepřijde mi, že je to vlastně k něčemu dobré. Přestat s číslováním 11.11., kdy vyšly 111. poznámky, by navíc bylo celkem vtipné.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jak jsem už psal, můj skript pro vytvoření šablony článku s týdenními poznámkami jsem změnil tak, aby hledal mnou sdílené věci na Telegramu místo na Pocketu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Podíval jsem se ještě, jestli by nešlo nějak elegantněji řešit napojení na Stravu, kde skript vždy zjišťuje, jak moc jsem daný týden sportoval, nebo jak jsem se flákal. Našel jsem skvělý projekt &lt;a href="https://github.com/liskin/strava-offline/"&gt;strava-offline&lt;/a&gt;, který je dokonce od autora, kterého znám :) Našel jsem hned jeden &lt;a href="https://github.com/liskin/strava-offline/issues/8"&gt;malý bug&lt;/a&gt;, ale Tomáš jej okamžitě opravil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nástroj umožňuje stáhnout si data ze Stravy do lokální SQLite a pak je třeba i inkrementálně aktualizovat. Řeší veškeré ofuky s přihlašováním do API, tokeny, apod. Skvělé! Mohl jsem smazat spoustu vlastního kódu. Navíc mám teď na disku data ze Stravy hezky v SQLite souboru a ten jsem si přidal do seznamu věcí, které se mi budou zálohovat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="novy-design-a-bootstrap"&gt;Nový design a Bootstrap&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#novy-design-a-bootstrap" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S designem jsem strávil nejspíš nejvíc času. Chtěl jsem k tomu opět přistoupit minimalisticky, ale rozhodl jsem se nahradit vlastní CSS frameworkem &lt;a href="https://getbootstrap.com/"&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;, přes který jen přeplácnu pár vlastních barev a komponent. Na junior.guru používám Bootstrap a &lt;a href="https://icons.getbootstrap.com/"&gt;Bootstrap Icons&lt;/a&gt; taky a chtěl jsem k sobě tyto mé dva hlavní projekty přiblížit, ať moje hlava nemusí moc přepínat (i když teda na junior.guru to mám v SCSS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poprvé jsem se odvážil více využít v designu &lt;em&gt;utility&lt;/em&gt; třídy místo samostatných komponent. Bohužel se to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCnKiGfxSHI"&gt;stalo nějak samo&lt;/a&gt; uprostřed stylování webu, takže půlka toho CSS je zbytečně „překomponentovaná” a druhá je spíš „tailwindovsky naprasená“ přímo přes třídy v HTML. Rád bych se k tomu někdy vrátil a některé komponenty zrušil na úkor pár ad-hoc tříd v HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experimentoval jsem s tím, že z úvodních obrázků článků vytáhnu dominantní barvu a ta někde bude, ale nakonec jsem to nevyužil. Překvapilo mě však, &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/61730849/325365"&gt;jak jednoduše to jde v Pythonu udělat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poprvé jsem použil &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;meta name="theme-color" content="#457E31"&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, což umí obarvit vršek prohlížeče v Safari na iOS. Možná i jinde.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Theme Color v Safari" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid figure-img rounded" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/img-022c48d5f8e7-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Výsledný design rozhodně není a nemá být revoluce. Některé prvky jsou dokonce návrat k nápadům, které už jsem na blogu dřív měl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zmeny-v-kodu"&gt;Změny v kódu&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#zmeny-v-kodu" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abych neměl v kódu už moc velký nepořádek, začal jsem tam používat &lt;a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/"&gt;click&lt;/a&gt; a všechno uklidil do balíčku. Super je, že strava-offline taky používá click, takže jsem mohl commandy sloučit a teď mohu napsat &lt;code&gt;blog strava&lt;/code&gt; a ovládat přes to vše, co mi strava-offline nabízí.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ blog strava
Usage: blog strava [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Projekt jsem převedl z &lt;code&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/code&gt; na &lt;a href="https://python-poetry.org/"&gt;Poetry&lt;/a&gt;. Zajímalo mě, zda jde Python knihovnu označit tak, aby nešla publikovat na PyPI. Matně si pamatuji, že u npm balíčků to nějak udělat šlo. Zjistil jsem, že PyPI na to &lt;a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#classifiers"&gt;má speciální klasifikátor&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;code&gt;Private :: Do Not Upload&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="proc"&gt;Proč?&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#proc" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Svou osobní stránku a blog jsem předělal ze dvou důvodů. Předně, už delší dobu mě štvalo, že web nemám v mnoha ohledech obsahově aktuální a že nepomáhá dostatečně mé osobní značce, ani mému podnikání, ačkoliv by mohl a měl. Za ty dva roky se dost věcí změnilo a chtěl jsem víc propagovat junior.guru přímo pod každým článkem. Také už se vidím víc jako podnikatel a &lt;a href="https://cestina20.cz/slovnik/mluvici-hlava/"&gt;mluvící hlava&lt;/a&gt; než programátor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zároveň jsem se v posledních týdnech z různých důvodů pustil do toho digitálního úklidu a tohle s tím oklikou souvislo. Potřeboval jsem si taky odpočinout od práce a předělávání vlastních webovek mi poskytlo hezkou náhradní činnost, do které jsem se mohl na dva týdny ponořit a prostě si chvíli jenom hrát. Celé to teď o víkendu završím výletem do hor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Budu rád, když mi dáte vědět, jak se vám nová podoba blogu líbí a co je tady na prd. Třeba to opravím. Napište do komentářů, nebo &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/honzajavorek.cz/issues"&gt;založte issue&lt;/a&gt; :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category></entry><entry><title>Týdenní poznámky #111: Kamarádi z Afriky</title><link href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/tydenni-poznamky-111-kamaradi-z-afriky/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-11-11T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2022-11-11T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Honza Javorek</name></author><id>tag:honzajavorek.cz,2022-11-11:/blog/tydenni-poznamky-111-kamaradi-z-afriky/</id><summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utekl zase nějaký ten týden (5.11. — 11.11.) a tak &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/tydenni-poznamky-110-zapaseni-s-ci-prednaska-zlin/"&gt;stejně jako minule&lt;/a&gt; sepisuji, co jsem dělal a co zajímavého jsem se naučil.

&lt;p&gt;Drtivou většinu týdne jsem trávil tím, že jsem se věnoval &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/jessica-upani-about-python-events-in-namibia-you-have-to-be-pure-in-terms-of-your-why/"&gt;kamarádům z Afriky&lt;/a&gt;, kteří do Prahy přijeli na &lt;a href="https://events.canonical.com/event/2/"&gt;Ubuntu Summit&lt;/a&gt;. Jeden večer jsme zařídili večeři, další večer jsme jim udělali zážitkovou prohlídku noční Prahy. Spousta organizačních věcí, někdo si zapomněl doma nabíječku a kupoval jsem rychle nějakou v Alze, někdo potřeboval invalidní vozík, spousta přesunů, apod., takže velká divočina. Měl jsem mít přes týden i nějaké schůzky, ale (aby organizace všeho výše nebyla moc jednoduchá), různě se přesouvaly nebo rušily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Kámoši z Afriky" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/afrika-kamosi.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/muheuenga"&gt;Muheue&lt;/a&gt; zůstal ještě o den déle, tak jsme mu udělali i denní prohlídku Prahy a protože vyšlo krásně počasí, bylo to fakt super. Můj kamarád, který prohlídky dělal, to měl dost vymakané a já sám jsem někdy čuměl, co pěkného v tom Starém Městě nebo na Malé Straně vlastně je a co vůbec neznám. Můj osobní &lt;em&gt;highlight&lt;/em&gt; byli Maltézští rytíři a jejich areál. Máme spoustu nádherných zážitků a fotek a dojemných, dobrodružných i vtipných situací. Já osobně z toho mám i velký spánkový deficit. Ale myslím, že se to celé moc pěkně vydařilo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Na Vítkově" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/afrika-vitkov.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="spojovani-databazi"&gt;Spojování databází&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#spojovani-databazi" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chtěl jsem vytvořit nějaký mechanismus, který mě upozorní, kdybych náhodou přepisoval data ve stejném sloupci ve stejné tabulce. Dovedu si představit, že jak vytvářím paralelní SQLite databáze a pak je po paralelizaci spojuji, tak by mohla vzniknout nepříjemná chyba z nepozornosti, kterou bych pak hledal hodně dlouho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nakonec jsem se rozhodl vůbec nepoužít &lt;code&gt;.insert_all()&lt;/code&gt; nebo &lt;code&gt;.upsert_all()&lt;/code&gt; z &lt;a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/"&gt;sqlite-utils&lt;/a&gt;, ani nepsat nějaké šílené SQL, se kterým bych zápasil celý den. Prostě jsem to napsal v Pythonu. Řádek po řádku kontroluje, co se přesně děje a řádky sloučí, nebo vyhodí chybu, pokud nastane situace, kdy bych měl přijít o nějaká data. Výkonnostně to, zdá se, nepředstavuje žádný problém a navíc mohu všechny situace transparentně logovat i testovat a nemusím se spoléhat na to, že jsem správně pochopil nějaký složitý SQL konstrukt, a to ještě v SQLite dialektu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hned mi to našlo chybu. Zapisoval jsem do tabulky s lidmi, kdy se registrovali na Discord. Potom jsem tam ale zapisoval znova, pokud jejich registrace na Memberful byla dřív. Spíš než že by mě to omezovalo, přišlo mi, že to nemám vlastně dělat. Že motám dvě věci dohromady a je to spíš &lt;em&gt;code smell&lt;/em&gt;. Přepracoval jsem tedy tuto část kódu a v tabulce jsou nyní dva různé sloupce s různou sémantikou a používají se v různých případech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slučování databází teď podle mě funguje dobře a bezpečně. Jediné, co neumím, je smazat věc. Kdyby jeden skript nastavil nějakou hodnotu v záznamu v tabulce, tak další skript ji nemůže přepsat &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; hodnotou. Slučování totiž nedokáže rozeznat, zda je tento &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; záměrný, nebo je to důsledek toho, že se prostě slučuje databáze, ve které nejel skript, který by danou hodnotu naplnil. Snad to nebude ničemu vadit, aktuálně to nikde nepotřebuji.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="posilani-mailu"&gt;Posílání mailů&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#posilani-mailu" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zjistil jsem, že maily se neposílají správně, protože se informace o jejich poslání ukládá do souboru a slučování souborů po paralelizaci funguje tak, že soubory stejného jména se nepřepisují, nikdy se soubor neaktualizuje a neuloží se nová informace co CircleCI keše, což by mělo zajistit perzistenci.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Přepracoval jsem, jak se slučují soubory. Porovnávají se a když jsou stejné, tak se tiše nic nestane, ale když jsou jiné, tak to selže s chybou. Zjistil jsem, že porovnávání souborů je přímo v Pythonu: &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/filecmp.html"&gt;filecmp&lt;/a&gt;. Počkám, až bude pondělí, jestli to selže, a dodělám potom nějaký seznam souborů, u kterých očekávám, že se budou přepisovat. To by mělo být dost funkční i defenzivní (mělo by mě to chránit před tichým přepisováním souborů, které přepisuji nechtěně).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="preskakovani-dlouhych-skriptu"&gt;Přeskakování dlouhých skriptů&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#preskakovani-dlouhych-skriptu" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Někdy programuji skript, který ale závisí na datech z nějakého velice dlouho trvajícího skriptu. Potřebuji to spouštět a ladit několikrát za sebou, ale nechci, aby se mi při tom lokálně stahovala stále tatáž data z toho dlouho trvajícího skriptu, která budou třeba jen o pět minut aktuálnější.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vytvořil jsem tedy potvrzení. Pokud je nastavena určitá environment variable, dlouhý skript se mě interaktivně zeptá, jestli má spláchnout svou tabulku a stahovat, nebo to přeskočit a nechat data jak už je mám. Díky &lt;code&gt;envvar&lt;/code&gt; a &lt;code&gt;confirm&lt;/code&gt; v &lt;a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/"&gt;clicku&lt;/a&gt; to bylo hotové raz dva. Přesně takhle jsem si to představoval, když jsem chtěl mít ty věci založené na clicku. Každý skript teď může mít snadno nějaké svoje parametry, je to flexibilní a je v tom pořádek. Environment variable si lokálně nastavuji přes &lt;a href="https://direnv.net/"&gt;direnv&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="drobna-vylepseni-klubu-bota-a-webu"&gt;Drobná vylepšení klubu, bota a webu&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#drobna-vylepseni-klubu-bota-a-webu" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smazal jsem v klubu roli, která umožňovala organizovat Discord akce. Dal jsem toto oprávnění všem, aby si každý mohl konat co chce a kdy chce a mohl na to efektivně upozornit ostatní. Nevím, proč jsem to neudělal už dávno, asi mě to prostě nenapadlo. Teď mě to napadlo, protože Dan si chtěl naplánovat několik událostí, na kterých dělá něco jako „open office hours“ pro zájemce o &lt;a href="https://coreskill.tech/"&gt;CoreSkill&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upravoval jsem textace některých automatických zpráv v klubu, aby je lidi lépe pochopili a bylo jasnější, co se děje a proč. Je zajímavé, jak lidi mohou dost zápasit s Discordem i s mými vlastními tipy a mým botem. Ale nedovím se to. Třeba prostě akorát na nic nekliknou. A když se Dan asertivně zeptal, proč někdo neklikl, odpověď byla „zaškrtala jsem několikrát, ale nevím, co to má dělat“. Asi bych se měl lidí víc ptát. Jenže mě to moc nejde, no.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opravil jsem několik drobných chyb v kódu, které asi nestojí za větší rozbor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do grafu s typy členství jsem přidal &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/#typy-clenstvi"&gt;speciální barvičku pro lidi se stipendiem&lt;/a&gt;. Když už jsem si s tím hrál, poladil jsem barvičky i v jiných grafech. Chtěl jsem začít programovat měření toho, jak lidi čtou onboarding tipy, abych měl data a mohl se nějak rozhodovat, co s tím dál. Ale zasekl jsem se na tom, že nevím, co chci vlastně měřit. Kolik lidí má rozečtených kolik tipů? Jak dlouhý je interval mezi tipy? Na kolikátém tipu je kolik lidí? Jak má vypadat ten graf, co chci vlastně vytvořit? Nevymyslel jsem to zatím.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Akce s Ataccamou má ještě volná místa, takže kdo chcete zkusit na pohovor nanečisto, &lt;a href="https://bit.ly/3e8lGdm"&gt;zaregistrujte se&lt;/a&gt;! Online nebo osobně v Praze v jejich kancelářích. Nemusíte být ani junioři.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přečetl jsem důkladně a následně &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1589624519311835136"&gt;pochválil na Twitteru&lt;/a&gt; článek Deníku N o lidech, kteří se rekvalifikují do IT. Je to celé vlákno s recenzí.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dokončili jsme &lt;a href="https://github.com/pyvec/docs.pyvec.org/pull/301"&gt;příspěvek jedné juniorky do open source Pyvce&lt;/a&gt;! Super!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odpovídání v klubu, maily, a tak dále. Povedlo se mi na chvíli dokonce dosáhnout inbox zero :) Většinu CVček jsem nedokázal projít, ale naštěstí se tam rozpovídali jiní lidi. Jedno CV zapadlo a nedostalo žádné komentáře a já stále odsunuji, že se na něj kouknu, tak jsem zkusil jen napsat do kanálu, zda by na něj někdo nemrknul. Uvidím, jaký to bude mít efekt :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domlouval jsem další přednášky do klubu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Připomenul jsem se advokátce s jednou věcí, co potřebujeme řešit pro Pyvec.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na GitHub Sponsors mě začal sponzorovat &lt;a href="https://github.com/indeedeng"&gt;Indeed Engineering&lt;/a&gt;! Velké překvapení. Předpokládám, že to je nějaká akce v rámci &lt;a href="https://opensource.indeedeng.io/Investing-in-Open-Source/"&gt;tohoto fondu&lt;/a&gt;. Fakt by mě zajímalo, jak se to stalo a co vlastně z mojich věcí, co mám na GitHubu, považují za přínosné :) Indeed je docela známý agregátor pracovních nabídek, takže je i trochu v mojem segmentu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přemýšlel jsem, jestli už úplně nezrušit Patreon a nepřesměrovat 3 lidi, kteří mi tam přispívají, na jiný způsob (třeba přímé posílání na účet, na které dost lidí přešlo), ale nakonec jsem se rozhodl, že je s tím nebudu otravovat a nechám to být.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Díky projektu Jakuba Zelenky &lt;a href="https://mimo-agendu.ghost.io/"&gt;Mimo agendu&lt;/a&gt; jsem objevil &lt;a href="https://beyondwords.io/"&gt;BeyondWords&lt;/a&gt;, věc, která má nějak pěkně zabalené strojové čtení od Microsoftu. Je to asi nejlepší čtení, které pro češtinu existuje a není to tady ani nijak pekelně drahé. Uvažoval jsem, že by se tím daly nechat načíst kapitoly v příručce. Dalo by se to i publikovat jako podcast, nebo tak něco.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Se ženou jsme spolu 12 let. Nebyl zatím čas to oslavit. Nejlepší by bylo, kdybychom mohli třeba den v kuse spát :D&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hrál jsem si s Duplo traktorem a Duplo ovcemi. Dítě už dokáže samo sjet menší skluzavku.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dostal jsem účet zdarma u &lt;a href="https://www.cdn77.com/"&gt;CDN77.com&lt;/a&gt; (děkuji!) a mám tedy docela cool CDNku! Teď jen vymyslet, co s ní udělám :D Už ale v mailu vidím super rozbor od &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/liborvanekcz/"&gt;Libora&lt;/a&gt; s radami, který je přímo na míru na moje &lt;em&gt;use cases&lt;/em&gt;, tak se těším, až se na to podívám.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 7 dní od 5.11. do 11.11. jsem nenaměřil žádnou sportovní aktivitu. Mohl bych napsat, že jsem se celkem hýbal 0 hodin a zdolal při tom 0 kilometrů, ale to je blbost, protože jsem toho nachodil a na sdílených kolech najezdil fakt dost. Ta sdílená kola začínám používat čím dál víc, jsou fakt super. Když na Žižkově teda jsou, protože v některé časy tady na kopci není ani jedno.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aktuální finanční výsledky, návštěvnost a další čísla k JG &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;mám přímo na webu&lt;/a&gt;. Nabídky práce pro juniory teď inzerují: &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/dbbb7bf406b3c33aeba36cae817919d44bfb368a08fb1b4899dba130/"&gt;Processand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/34fa3ec07892dd3ff64458e2ccbf12578e00860483427e9e7c4847bc/"&gt;Red Hat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dvě věci, které bych chtěl zvládnout udělat příště:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zvládnout uvítání mentorů v Mews (večerní akce v klubu, kde budu mluvit a prezentovat i já).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vyřešit poslední nefunkčnosti týkající se CI buildu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pokud byste čistě náhodou měli dojem, že jste oproti mě za uplynulý týden vůbec nic nestihli, tak mám pro vás skvělou zprávu! V klidu se na ten dojem &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/neni-to-zavod/"&gt;můžete vykašlat&lt;/a&gt;. Není zač!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minulý týden jsem nezvládl napsat poznámky. Bylo toho nějak moc. Taky jsme byli ve Zlíně u babičky a rozhodl jsem se, že si tam i trochu odpočinu, že to potřebuju, takže jsem třeba jeden celý den dělal něco na zahradě a nepracoval jsem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nejlepší bylo, že jsem klikl na upgrade macOS Ventura a ten se nějak pokazil. Nikdy se mi to nestalo a proto jsem na to klikl i přesto, že jsem potřeboval pracovat a odjet druhý den vlakem na opačný konec republiky. Nejdřív se to stahovalo snad 10 hodin, potom se to sice nainstalovalo, ale blbě, padalo to do recovery módu a tam byl progress bar na dalších 10 nebo kolik hodin. Během toho jsem jel tím vlakem, ještě o 20 minut zpožděným už na příjezdu, a jen doufal, že se mi to povede ve Zlíně nějak rozjet. Nakonec se to fakt spravilo samo a dokonce i za méně hodin, než bylo na progress baru, ale byl jsem ve stresu a po několika dnech beznadějného programování (viz dále) to dost ovlivnilo můj psychický stav. Naštěstí jsem se mohl vypovídat investorce a odpočinout si pak o víkendu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taky jsem se u babičky snad poprvé od narození dcery vyspal jednou do 11 hodin, což bylo osvěžující :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zapaseni-s-ci"&gt;Zápasení s CI&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#zapaseni-s-ci" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prakticky celý předchozí týden jsem vymýšlel a pokus-omyl prozkoumával, jak by mohly po novém fungovat CI buildy na JG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jen připomenu, že CI build je pro JG produkce. Celý projekt funguje tak, že se jednou nebo víckrát denně spustí CI, tam se vše stáhne, vyhodnotí, synchronizuje, udělají se změny na Discordu, pošlou maily, vygeneruje se statická stránka a deployne, a hotovo. JG záměrně nemá žádný jiný runtime. A ano, znamená to, že bot na Discordu reaguje třeba i s denním zpožděním, nebo že nemůžu mít na webu žádný formulář. Výhoda je, že nepotřebuju řešit servery, databáze, uptime, produkční chyby, nic mi v noci nespadne a nezačne mi to pípat na mobilu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Povedlo se mi několikrát za sebou omylem poslat tytéž maily, protože kontrolní mechanismus jsem změnami rozbil. Řešil jsem, jak paralelizovat celý build na CircleCI &lt;a href="https://circleci.com/blog/how-to-boost-build-time-with-test-parallelism/"&gt;pomocí funkcí, které nabízí&lt;/a&gt;. Šlo hlavně o to, jak mohu sloučit soubory a SQLite databázi po tom, co se běh rozdělí do několika paralelních. Rozbil jsem při tom i kumulativní keš dat kolem nabídek práce a budu je muset obnovit ze zálohy. Příruční &lt;a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/"&gt;Datasette&lt;/a&gt; mi pomohlo zjistit, proč je moje databáze je najednou menší o 100 MB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slučování dat jsem nakonec vyřešil tak, že mám skript, který projede vše, co je ve složce s JG a zapamatuje si časy poslední změny k jednotlivým souborům. Udělá tedy něco jako &lt;em&gt;snapshot&lt;/em&gt;. Potom se spustí synchronizace a pak se zase spustí skript, který udělá nový &lt;em&gt;snapshot&lt;/em&gt;, porovná je, a změněné soubory si odloží bokem tak, aby je šlo později přenést do další fáze buildu a sloučit. Slučovací skript se umí poprat s databází.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nejdřív jsem naivně exportoval SQL dump, upravil jej, aby byl idempotentní (CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS, INSERT OR REPLACE INTO, CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS), a pak načetl všechny dumpy přes sebe, ale to byla blbost. Zjistil jsem totiž (opět díky zkoumání výsledku pomocí příruční Datasette), že některé synchronizační skripty zapisují do stejné tabulky. Takže jsem to udělal normálně tak, že se databáze otevře, čte se z jedné a záznamy se kopírují do druhé formou nějakých UPSERTů, kdy neexistující záznamy se převedou jak jsou a existujícím se updatují pouze NULL sloupce, pokud je pro ně v přenášeném záznamu nějaká hodnota. Dalo mi dost práce to udělat správně, protože &lt;a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/issues/66"&gt;UPSERTy jsou v SQLite trochu zamotané&lt;/a&gt;. Tohle mi funguje a hezky to merguje paralelně vytvořené databáze přesně tak, jak potřebuju.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celkem mi při tom pomáhá i &lt;a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/"&gt;sqlite-utils&lt;/a&gt;, ale asi by to všechno šlo snadno udělat i &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html"&gt;přímo z Pythonu&lt;/a&gt; a v některých verzích kódu jsem to tak měl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taky pomáhá, že před manipulací s databází vypínám WAL mód, aby fungovala víc jako jeden soubor, což jsem dřív nedělal a možná proto jsem občas dostával chyby související s poškozením databáze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nakonec jsem si hrál s rozdělením různých fází buildu. Jeden skript, na kterém záviselo spousta jiných, jsem vyčlenil před hlavní build a díky tomu jsem mohl mnohem lépe paralelizovat zbytek. Pak mi došlo, že bych mohl vedle něj pustit i všechny další skripty, které na ničem nezávisí a tak mám vlastně dvoufázový build, kdy se v první řadě paralelizuje tohle a pak se paralelizuje zbytek. Rozdělení do fází jsem si naprogramoval a počet paralelních kontejnerů, nebo co to je, se kontroluje a záměrně to spadne, pokud ideální počet nesedí s tím, co je nastaveno v YAML konfiguraci buildů. Při ladění mi pomohlo implementovat si &lt;code&gt;--dry-run&lt;/code&gt; option, která jen vytiskne do terminálu názvy skriptů, místo aby se spustily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ovšem způsobilo, že druhá fáze buildu začala spouštět znova věci z té první, protože nevěděla, že už vlastně běžely. Potřeboval jsem, aby si synchronizace uměla evidovat co běželo, a to napříč procesy a dokonce napříč několika fázemi buildu. Dal jsem to tedy do databáze. S každým spuštěním synchronizace se uloží pod nějakým ID a k tomu se eviduje, co už běželo. Nic se nepouští dvakrát. Jako ID se při vývoji automaticky vezme nějaký timestamp spuštění, aby se to vždy spláchlo, ale na CI se vezme ID workflow (měl jsem tam ID jobu a to byla blbost, nefungovalo to správně, DoS-ovalo to Discord API a opravoval jsem to potom), takže se to v průběhu nespláchne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nejvíc jsem se ale natrápil se strukturou kódu, který mi organizuje jednotlivé commandy v &lt;a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/"&gt;clicku&lt;/a&gt;. Vždy jsem něco předpokládal a pak jsem zjistil, že jsem to předpokládal špatně. Chtěl jsem to mít udělané nějak pohodlně a zároveň vyvážit co je explicitní a co je magické a co se děje během importu a co až když se něco spustí, totálně jsem se do toho zamotal a v podstatě několik dní v kuse jsem přepisoval dokola stále tytéž soubory a narážel na tytéž opakující se chyby. Co mít jako command group? Jak rozšířit třídy? Jak bude vypadat command? Odkud co se bude importovat, aby se neimportovalo cyklicky? Jak udělat správně dekorátory a dělat vlastně vůbec nějaké? Spousta commitů, refactoringu, přemýšlení, revertů. Dohnalo mě to k velké frustraci a povedlo se mi to vyřešit až v pondělí den před přednáškou, kdy jsem u toho, byť odpočatý po víkendu, seděl až do pozdního večera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Postupně jsem čas buildu dostal z 40min na 36min a potom dokonce až na 24min. Chtěl jsem spočítat, kolik to je ušetřeného času, ale pak jsem si všiml, že to píše přímo CircleCI ve svém UI, takže rovnou vidím, že je to celé zhruba o 35 % rychlejší.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teď můžu případně optimalizovat některé skripty, aby byly rychlejší, ale vlastně to ani nemá moc smysl dělat u všech. Jen u těch, které jsou nejdelší a zdržují celý paralelně běžící balík.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Některé věci se mi ještě nepovedlo dořešit. Nefunguje správně posílání mailů a musel jsem ho na chvíli vypnout, aby se v pondělí neposlalo nějak moc mailů. Taky jsem ztratil historii nabídek práce a musím je nějak obnovit a možná celé vymyslet jinak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="prednaska-v-klubu"&gt;Přednáška v klubu&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#prednaska-v-klubu" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protože je u babičky špatný internet, jel jsem na přednášku v klubu ke švagrovi s tím, že tam pak i přespím, večer pokecáme a uděláme na zahradě druhý den nějakou práci. Bohužel jsem na místě zjistil, že má úplně stejně špatný internet, 10/1. S tímhle se fakt nedá streamovat na YouTube a vlastně je skoro i problém mít vůbec stabilní videohovor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Měl jsem fakt za to, že tam je internet rychlejší, ale jak se říká, myslet je hovno vědět. Nebo jak říkal jeden lektor v Londýně, slovo assumptions začíná slovem ass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Přednášku jsem tentokrát připravil skvěle a všechny úkony udělal správně, okna měl správně, tlačítka zmáčknul správně, ale co mi to pomohlo, když mi vypadával internet a speakera jsem ani neslyšel. Úplný fail. Odpojil jsem z wifi i svůj mobil, vypnul všechny ostatní programy, ale stejně, nepomohlo to. Stream rozhodně ne, ale ani záznam neměl moc smysl a po čase jsem to vypnul, protože by na záznamu bylo jen chrčení.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michala, přednášejícího, jsem na to před přednáškou upozornil a omluvil jsem se. Nabídl se, že může udělat záložní nahrávku u sebe, ale po přednášce jsme zjistili, že se mu nepovedlo nahrát zvuk :D Mám teď jeho soubor s nahrávkou a nějaké svoje, ale neměl jsem zatím čas to nějak poslepovat nebo analyzovat, zda má smysl z toho něco vůbec dělat. Jen jsem se omluvil lidem v klubu, že záznam nejspíš ani nebude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Měl jsem pak dost blbou náladu, ale nějak se spravila soutěží o knihu (viz dál) a večerním pokecem u vína. U švagra byl na přednášku aspoň v oddělené místnosti klid, protože u babičky není moc kam se takhle schovat. Ale pro příště vím, že buď si v našem Zlínském „letovisku“ zařídím lepší internet, nebo že odtamtud prostě přednášky dělat nemůžu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ale investorku napadla ještě jedna věc, která možná není vůbec blbost: Měl bych najít někoho, kdo ty přednášky bude řídit za mě a bude to jeho jediná práce! Tím by se mi dost podstatně uvolnil i kalendář. Stejně jen klikám na tlačítka, uvádím speakera, atd. Je to perfektně delegovatelné.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="soutez-o-knihu"&gt;Soutěž o knihu&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#soutez-o-knihu" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vzhurudolu.cz/"&gt;Martin Michálek&lt;/a&gt; dal klubu pět svých knih &lt;a href="https://www.vzhurudolu.cz/css-layout/"&gt;CSS: moderní layout&lt;/a&gt;, abych je rozdal členům. Jeden kus mám doma s věnováním a mohu říct, že je to moc pěkná a užitečná kniha. Muselo to dát strašné práce! 440 stran, 904 gramů.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dlouho jsem přemýšlel, jak knihy rozdat. Nechtěl jsem dělat jen nějaké hlasování a losování. Trvalo mi měsíce něco vymyslet, ale s výsledkem jsem velmi spokojený. Lidi měli napsat, která oblast CSS jim dala nebo dává nejvíc zabrat - museli se ji složitě učit, nešla moc dobře pochopit, atd. Připojili větu o tom, proč to nešlo, co si myslí, že na tom bylo nejsložitější, nebo hodili odkaz na nějaký návod, díky kterému se to konečně naučili. Příklad ze života (mého):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure figure-blockquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CSS flexbox&lt;/strong&gt; - měl jsem zmatek ve všech těch vlastnostech a nepamatoval jsem si je. Procvičoval jsem je přes https://flexboxfroggy.com/, ale stejně mi to nepomáhalo. Nakonec mě vyučila až praxe, prostě jsem se to snažil použít. Nejvíc jsem čerpal z https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/ a dodnes to mám v záložkách a pravidelně to při psaní CSS otevírám, nedám bez toho ani ránu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Z lidí, kteří takto odpoví, jsem losoval pět výherců, náhodně. Následně jsem je kontaktoval, dali mi korespondenční adresu a Martin jim knížku pošle. Nezáleželo na tom, jakou práci si s příspěvkem dali, ale věřil jsem, že se posnaží a pokusí se fakt rozepsat a přidat odkazy, abychom se všichni něco díky této soutěži naučili. A fakt se všichni snažili!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vzniklo nádherné vlákno, užitečné všem. Jak samotným soutěžícím, tak i Martinovi, který si z toho udělal poznámky na svoje další výukové činnosti a materiály. Soutěž jsem nechal běžet skoro měsíc a vyhodnocoval jsem ji 1.11. večer po přednášce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Udělal jsem to trochu napínavé a že byli zrovna lidi online, tak se v den losování spustila lavina memů a gifů a mělo to perfektní atmosféru. &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/If8fVpUrzCM"&gt;Natočil jsem video z losování&lt;/a&gt;, schválně jako screencast toho, jak to losování programuju, aby to bylo poučné, a nahrával jsem ho pak na YouTube, ale jak jsem byl na strašně pomalém internetu, tak to trvalo věčnost a lidi byli o to víc napjatí. Chtěl jsem tam dát mp3 s „to sou nervy“ z &lt;a href="http://milujipraci.cz/"&gt;opravy traktoru&lt;/a&gt;, ale zjistil jsem, že je za tím ještě „ty pi*o“ :D tak jsem to ještě ořízl v Audacity a dal to do klubu bez toho, což sklidilo velký ohlas :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Některé to tak nabudilo, že i když knihu nevyhráli, šli si ji koupit :D Takže se to fakt celé moc hezky povedlo a měl jsem z toho pak dost dobrou náladu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="adhd"&gt;ADHD&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#adhd" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kdysi jsem četl &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/commentisfree/2020/jan/15/a-new-life-being-diagnosed-with-adhd-in-my-40s-has-given-me-something-quite-magical"&gt;článek&lt;/a&gt;, který mě trochu nalomil, ale pak jsem nad tím mávl rukou, že diagnostikovat se z internetu na takové věci je asi jako číst si horoskopy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No ale teď přišlo ještě &lt;a href="https://www.mujrozhlas.cz/vinohradska-12/dospeli-adhd-nemate-ho-taky-snaz-se-pozna-lide-jsou-ochotnejsi-problemy-resit"&gt;tohle&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://denikn.cz/1000209/studio-n-jak-se-zije-s-adhd/"&gt;tohle&lt;/a&gt; a dostala se ke mě &lt;a href="http://nepozornidospeli.cz/images/ADHD_prowebFIN.pdf"&gt;tahle příručka&lt;/a&gt;. Jak jsme byli u babičky, měl jsem konečně čas se tím trochu probrat a začínám mít fakt velmi vážné podezření, že je to přesně o mně! Jako by to vysvětlovalo celý můj život :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nad tímhle rukou mávnout už nemůžu. Bylo by to nějak moc náhod najednou. Jsem vlastně už docela přesvědčený, že to mám, ale určitě zkusím vyhledat někoho, kdo by mi mohl udělat diagnózu. Nevím, kdy na to zase budu mít čas, ale zkusím svoje pátrání po kouskách posouvat dál.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Napsal jsem na Twitter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1588147581544239104"&gt;kritiku článku, který vyšel na Seznam Zprávách&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Řešil jsem, proč se moje loggery na JG jmenují každý jinak. Některé mají celou cestu k modulu, s tečkama, jiné mají jen název modulu. Pak jsem zjistil, že &lt;code&gt;__name__&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html#name-main"&gt;funguje jinak pro balíčky a jinak pro moduly&lt;/a&gt; :-o Nikdy jsem si toho nevšiml. Takže jsem všude změnil, jak se loggery pojmenovávají a dělám to parsováním &lt;code&gt;__file__&lt;/code&gt;, ať to mám všude stejně a tak, jak mi to vyhovuje.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odpovídání v klubu, maily, a tak dále. V klubu se roztrhl pytel s CVčky a i když jsem jich postupně prošel snad 10, tak tam na mě dalších 10 čeká.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Koukal jsem na &lt;a href="https://grantjenks.com/docs/diskcache/tutorial.html"&gt;diskcache&lt;/a&gt;, jestli by mi nemohla pomoci s urychlením některých skriptů, ale přišlo mi to nějaké moc složité pro můj případ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Koupil jsem si &lt;a href="https://www.oliverburkeman.com/books"&gt;Four Thousand Weeks&lt;/a&gt;, ale nedočetl jsem zatím ani úvod, vždycky jsem usnul.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;S Matějem Kotrbou v návaznosti na přednášku v klubu připravujeme něco o věcech, které by firmy fakt neměly říkat lidem na pohovoru.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do svého osobního kalendáře přednášek jsem přidal automatický event týden před přednáškou, který mi připomene, že mám přednášku propagovat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Měl jsem mít schůzku s někým, kdo chce založit vzdělávací byznys, ale nakonec to nevyšlo. Třeba příští týden.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zjistil jsem, že existuje &lt;a href="https://www.switchup.org/"&gt;SwitchUp&lt;/a&gt;, neznal jsem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Viděl jsem &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTisy5gmP7I"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;, ze kterého je vystřižený dramatic look chipmunk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Komunikoval jsem s klientem a při tom jsem mu chtěl poslat nějaká čísla k našemu podcastu. Tak jsem se přihlásil do všech služeb a zjistil je. YouTube 147 subscribers, 969 views. Google Podcasts 97 subscribers, 463 meaningful plays. Spotify 484 followers, 979 listeners (= unikátní lidi, kteří si pustili epizody), 4357 streams (= přehrání delší než minutu). Apple Podcasts 172 followers, 195 engaged listeners, 3000 plays. Plus 3100 unikátních návštěv, 4800 zobrazení &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/podcast/"&gt;webové stránky podcastu&lt;/a&gt;, kde se dá epizody pustit nebo stahovat přes RSS, ale kde neměříme stáhnutí samotných souborů s mp3. Čísla jsou za poslední rok, tedy za celou dobu existence podcastu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poslouchal jsem prima epizodu &lt;a href="https://www.programhrovani.cz/1843229/11599562-o-organizovani-meetupu-s-lumirem-balharem"&gt;ProgramHRování s Lumírem&lt;/a&gt;, který rozjel Python komunitu v Ostravě.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prošel jsem si konečně &lt;a href="https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNwruVI0RmvsKp3S34P8_OM_mAQJNaPoovZ5OraGDD-ncSDpEU6jIf_4ENItxoyXg?key=QllETmJUcm9sdExBWERfeWcxbWozZ01sRU5yUjB3"&gt;fotky z CBW 2022&lt;/a&gt; a zjistil jsem, že tam mám spoustu pěkných fotek!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Měli jsme schůzi výboru Pyvce. Řešily se hlavně účty na Google a jejich organizace. Pokusil jsem se zase o kousek posunout &lt;a href="https://github.com/pyvec/docs.pyvec.org/pull/292"&gt;práci na opravě chyby&lt;/a&gt; v jednom Pyvec repozitáři a mám se ještě ozvat advokátce a něco jí připomenout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;S &lt;a href="https://www.designui.cz/landing-page-odshora-az-dolu?referral_code=31kql18"&gt;Lukášem Augustou&lt;/a&gt; jsme si psali, že by bylo fajn, kdyby &lt;a href="https://memberful.com/"&gt;Memberful&lt;/a&gt; zavedl češtinu. Ze sportu jsem napsal do Memberful na support, jestli to stále ještě neplánují (už kdysi jsem to po nich chtěl a Lukáš prý taky, ale bez velkého efektu). Nejdřív odepsali zase něco neurčitého, ale pak napsali, že češtinu zavedou! Wow! To jsme fakt nečekali :D Takže z JG už konečně nebudou chodit maily, které jsou napůl anglicky a napůl česky. A registrace a administrace budou taky česky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;YouTube zavádí podporu pro handly, tak jsem si pro &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp-dlEJLFPaNExzYX079gCA"&gt;kanál JG&lt;/a&gt; zaregistroval handle &lt;code&gt;@juniordotguru&lt;/code&gt;, podobně jako na dalších sociálních sítích, kde nebylo volné přímo juniorguru.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prošel jsem si sloupec v Trellu, který mám na administrativní úkoly a který už přetékal všelijakým bincem. Spoustu úkolů jsem smazal, seřadil jsem to podle priorit, roztřídil co patřilo jinam.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Koordinoval jsem návštěvu kamarádů z Namibie a Zimbabwe v Praze příští týden. Přijedou na The Ubuntu Summit a nejspíš se poprvé po více jak 2 letech od mé návštěvy &lt;a href="https://na.pycon.org/"&gt;PyCon NA&lt;/a&gt; uvidíme!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zpracoval jsem dvě žádosti o stipendium. Změnil jsem texty a otázky ve &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeJ_Bmq__X8AA-XbKqU-Vr1N6fdGHSBQ-IuneO5zhBcGCOgjQ/viewform?usp=sf_link"&gt;formuláři na stipendium&lt;/a&gt;. Hlásili se mi lidi, kteří za klub akorát nechtěli platit, ne že na to neměli. Hlásili se mi lidi, kteří klub ani nevyzkoušeli, i když je tam napsané, že to vyzkoušet mají. Některé otázky byly pro odpovídající špatně rozlišitelné a psali do nich skoro totožné texty. Tak jsem to udělal trochu jinak a součástí formuláře je nyní bohužel i dotaz „Proč je pro tebe 109 Kč měsíčně za podpůrnou skupinu příliš drahé?“&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nainstaloval jsem si &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome%3A_Total_War"&gt;Rome: Total War&lt;/a&gt; a prošel tutoriál. Na víc jsem se nezmohl a když jsem měl chvilku, zahrál jsem si zase &lt;a href="https://play0ad.com/"&gt;0 AD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Viděl jsem &lt;a href="https://www.formula1.com/en/racing/2022/Mexico.html"&gt;GP Mexika&lt;/a&gt; a byla to mega nuda.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na uvítací zprávu od bota, kde lidi prosí, aby napsali v &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/handbook/"&gt;jaké juniorní fázi podle příručky&lt;/a&gt; jsou, nikdo moc neodpovídá. Tak jsem to zkusil předělat tak, že bot rovnou pod svou zprávou udělá reakce s čísly, na které stačí kliknout. Při tom se mi povedlo udělat chybu a bot očísloval spoustu jiných zpráv, nebo čísla dával v náhodném pořadí, ale asi jsem to už opravil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Propagoval jsem &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/podcast/"&gt;novou epizodu podcastu&lt;/a&gt; s Markétou Lourenco o cestě od lingvistiky k datové analýze. Propagoval jsem přednášku v klubu s Michalem z Codeac.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 14 dní od 22.10. do 4.11. jsem naběhal 19 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 2 hodin a zdolal při tom 19 kilometrů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aktuální finanční výsledky, návštěvnost a další čísla k JG &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;mám přímo na webu&lt;/a&gt;. Nabídky práce pro juniory teď inzerují: &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/dbbb7bf406b3c33aeba36cae817919d44bfb368a08fb1b4899dba130/"&gt;Processand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/215426887eaaad9105ecf647d0ff24cf94de7c9eb47cc6f2c55e6921/"&gt;Red Hat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="co-planuji"&gt;Co plánuji&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#co-planuji" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tři věci, které bych chtěl zvládnout udělat příště:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Věnovat se kamarádům z Namibie a Zimbabwe, kteří přijedou do Prahy na konferenci.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Změřit, jak moc a jestli vůbec lidi čtou tipy v onboardingu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vyřešit poslední nefunkčnosti týkající se CI buildu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus:&lt;/strong&gt; Zadat práci kamarádovi, který se tváří, že by mohl dělat rozhovory s juniorama, které bychom pak publikovali na JG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-co-vy"&gt;A co vy?&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#a-co-vy" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud byste čistě náhodou měli dojem, že jste oproti mě za uplynulý týden vůbec nic nestihli, tak mám pro vás skvělou zprávu! V klidu se na ten dojem &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/neni-to-zavod/"&gt;můžete vykašlat&lt;/a&gt;. Není zač!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="co-me-zaujalo"&gt;Co mě zaujalo&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#co-me-zaujalo" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když si něco přečtu nebo poslechnu a líbí se mi to, &lt;a href="https://getpocket.com/@honzajavorek"&gt;sdílím to na Pocketu&lt;/a&gt;. Od posledních poznámek jsem sdílel toto:&lt;/p&gt;

Spása spočívá v myšlence, že má naše místo na planetě jakýsi smysl. Náboženství vám tento důvod dává. Pokud ale věřící nejste, můžete nabýt pocitu, že své existenci dáte význam, když toho budete dělat dostatečně mnoho.“&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id="prednaska-s-matejem-kotrbou"&gt;Přednáška s Matějem Kotrbou&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#prednaska-s-matejem-kotrbou" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mat%C4%9Bjkotrba/"&gt;Matěj Kotrba&lt;/a&gt; měl v klubu přednášku a na rozdíl od minulého týdne se na akci přihlásilo skoro 50 lidí a přišlo 22. Asi téma „jak se připravit na pohovor“ holt táhlo víc. Slabá návštěva minulé přednášky mě stále mrzí, ale na YouTube už má přes 30 shlédnutí, tak asi nakonec dobrý a jsem rád, že se lidi mezitím trochu rozhýbali a na Matěje dorazili, a to dokonce i přesto, že veřejně jsem jeho přednášku propagoval až den předem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hrozilo, že se dostaneme přes limit Discordu na účastníky video hovoru a že se použije online stream, který dělám na YouTube, ale nakonec jsme se vešli do 25 lidí a nepoužilo se to. Matěj měl velký prostor pro dotazy a ty pršely, takže to celé mělo skoro dvě hodiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na začátku přednášky jsem zazmatkoval a přepl špatně okno při výběru toho, co chci natáčet v OBS. Jenže pak to nešlo naklikat zpět, nešlo vybrat to okno, které jsem potřeboval. Klikal jsem tak dlouho, až jsem to vzdal a začal prostě nahrávat celý svůj Discord, ne pouze pop-up s videohovorem, nedalo se nic dělat. Druhý den jsem to nějak spravil, aby to bylo pro příště zase nastaveno správně.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Před přednáškou a i po ní jsem si aktualizoval &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/event/"&gt;seznam úkonů&lt;/a&gt;, které potřebuji v souvislosti s akcí v klubu udělat. Dal jsem si ho nově ne do GitHub Gistu, ale na samostatnou „tajnou“ stránku přímo na webu. Přijde mi, že je těch úkonů strašně moc a že je čistě statisticky vyloučeno, abych při každé přednášce neudělal nějakou chybu z nepozornosti. Budu muset něco z toho automatizovat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Při té příležitosti jsem přidal na web podporu pro to, že mohu u libovolné stránky v Markdownu snadno nastavit, aby nebyla indexována vyhledávači. To jsem u této nové stránky rovnou využil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zpetna-vazba"&gt;Zpětná vazba&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#zpetna-vazba" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na základně „zpětnovazebního“ tipu, který teď chodí lidem, mi někteří začali psát zpětnou vazbu na klub. Někteří to jen odklikli a nic nenapsali :(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Každopádně jsem si uvědomil, že tahle zpětná vazba bude spíš kvalitativní než kvantitativní, nebo minimálně něco mezi. Vede spíš ke konverzaci nebo k promyšleným odpovědím, které neumím zpracovat nějak hromadně, ale jsou velmi zajímavé. Uvědomil jsem si, že jsem chtěl zpětnou vazbu, ale teď úplně nevím, co s ní. Pozitivní bych si měl někam zapisovat a z negativní bych měl možná dělat Trello kartičky s úkoly. Každopádně něco si zapíšu sem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure figure-blockquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Příjemně mě překvapila aktivita lidí. Tady se furt něco děje, ve středu bude přednáška, v prosinci Advent of Code. Člověk se tu prostě necítí sám. Jo a taky se mi líbí výrobky. Tam ze zvědavosti hodně ráda koukám.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Připojit se do klubu mě přesvědčily až Honzovi týdenní zápisky 😃&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O junior.guru mám povědomí už od začátku léta. Vím, že jsem na něj narážela, když jsem si mapovala juniorní pozice. A taky už nějakou dobu poslouchám podcast. A právě si nejsem jistá, co z toho bylo dřív.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hodně oceňuju možnost si nějaký příspěvek označit špendlíkem. To je fakt dobrá vychytávka!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vím, že jsem četl příručku a začal jsem tě sledovat na různých sociálních sítích a tam jsem narazil po nějáké době na výzvu ohledně Discordu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A na kvantitativní zpětnou vazbu pak musím asi zavést jen nějaké rychlé a jednoduché hlasování přes emoji. Jinak se asi nedovím, co mi do klubu přivádí lidi a co můžu zrušit - jestli je to Google, podcast, osobní doporučení, nebo moje statusy na Instagramu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="prekopavani-kodu-z-invoke-na-click"&gt;Překopávání kódu z invoke na click&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#prekopavani-kodu-z-invoke-na-click" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Z minulého týdne jsem se těšil, že převedu na &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/click/"&gt;click&lt;/a&gt; celou „synchronizaci“ JG, což je soustava skriptů, které se každý den spouští na CI a stahují a posílají data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musím říct, že mě click nadchnul. Myslel jsem, že je to overkill, ale je jednoduchý a zároveň dává člověku si cokoliv udělat podle sebe. Mohu tam udělat vše jako v &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/invoke/"&gt;invoke&lt;/a&gt;, ale vlastně o mnoho víc a transparentněji a méně magicky. Základní kód jsem měl celkem rychle, ale je to trochu naprasené, tak to ještě budu refaktorovat. Knihovnu invoke jsem následně definitivně odstranil z kódu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koukal jsem pak na &lt;a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/shell-completion/"&gt;Shell completion&lt;/a&gt;. Říkal jsem si, že by bylo super, kdyby mi to při vývoji napovídalo názvy skriptů a nemusel bych je stále vypisovat. Ale i když se mi to po různých peripetiích povedlo nějak rozchodit, bylo to nějaké strašně pomalé a vzdal jsem to. Taky jsem kvůli tomu musel &lt;a href="https://dev.to/bphogan/use-modern-bash-shell-on-macos-22a6"&gt;nainstalovat novější Bash&lt;/a&gt;, protože ten výchozí v macOS je údajně nějaký prehistorický (ne že by mě to doteď omezovalo).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rozhodl jsem se, že dělení synchronizace na „hlavní“ skripty a pak část, kde se stahují pracovní nabídky, a pak nějakou část, která vše spojuje dohromady, opustím. Že to stejně neodpovídá časově, protože pracovní nabídky jsou teď moc rychlé a ta hlavní část je moc pomalá a chtělo by to paralelizovat jinak. Takže by se to, když už do toho rýpu, hodilo udělat obecněji a využít i &lt;a href="https://circleci.com/blog/how-to-boost-build-time-with-test-parallelism/"&gt;paralelizaci, kterou má v sobě přímo CircleCI&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když jsem měl systém příkazů, které reprezentují jednotlivé skripty a u každého jsem měl vydefinované závislosti, tak už zbývalo jen naprogramovat funkci, která mi z toho „vypočítá“, které skripty mohou jet paralelně, protože na sobě nezávisí. Tuto funkci jsem psal „pouze“ půl dne a stal jsem se při tom mistrem práce s množinami v Pythonu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na základě výsledku téhle funkce jsem udělal příkaz, který tyto &lt;em&gt;chains&lt;/em&gt;, jak jsem to pojmenoval, vypíše každý na nový řádek. To předhodím CircleCI a opravdu to funguje, &lt;a href="https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/honzajavorek/junior.guru/6156/workflows/cf6ebfa0-ddc9-47dd-9981-c7bac33b6cd6/jobs/32349/parallel-runs/1?filterBy=ALL"&gt;pouští se to paralelně&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Škoda, že to také vytvoří tři nebo čtyři paralelní databáze, složky s obrázky, nebo cache pro Scrapy… takže jsem začal řešit, co s tím, jak to sesbírat, jak to přesunout do další fáze buildu, a jak to v ní sloučit do jednoho výsledku. Naprasil jsem nějaké dva příkazy &lt;code&gt;jg data node&lt;/code&gt; a &lt;code&gt;jg data merge&lt;/code&gt;, které hlavně kopírují soubory z místa na místo. Skoro to vypadá, že to funguje, ale můj primitivní přístup ke sloučení paralelně vytvořených databází je asi moc primitivní a další fáze buildu si stěžují, že jim chybí tabulky. Dál jsem se zatím nedostal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taky je trochu problém, že prakticky všechno z různých důvodů závisí na jednom skriptu, který zjišťuje informace o obsahu Discordu. Nemá moc smysl to pak paralelizovat. Tento skript bude potřeba vytáhnout před všechny ostatní a pak se to dá paralelizovat krásně, skoro do deseti „uzlů“, jak jim říká CircleCI. Jenže jak si zase předat tu databázi a jak ji pak sloučit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Je to zapeklité. Nemyslím si, že bych měl opustit SQLite jako místo, kde se ukládají data a kde si je skripty čtou. Na druhou stranu, sdílet SQLite mezi různými mašinami a nějak ji rozdělovat a slepovat, to se zdá nebude zrovna jednoduchý úkol. Pár nápadů mám, ale žádný mi nepřijde úplně úžasný. Mám víc šermovat s &lt;a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/"&gt;sqlite-utils&lt;/a&gt; a ukládat věci jako JSON soubory a slepovat je a rozdělovat je? Mám pro přenos tabulek použít SQL dump?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A protože dělám &lt;em&gt;continuous delivery&lt;/em&gt;, tak mi teď nefunguje CI a padá to a bude to padat do pondělí, nebo do dne, kdy budu mít čas s tím nějak pohnout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do skriptu, který vyhodnocuje palečky a srdíčka pod příspěvky, jsem přidal podporu pro emoji s různou barvou kůže, tedy aby se růžové palce započítaly stejně jako žluté, nebo tmavě hnědé. Musím říct, že když jsem do toho začal vrtat, tak mi &lt;a href="https://github.com/carpedm20/emoji/issues/204"&gt;vybuchla hlava z toho, co všechno tenhle problém zahrnuje&lt;/a&gt;, ale naštěstí mě zajímá jen zlomek té věci a nějak jsem to nakonec díky knihovně &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/emoji/"&gt;emoji&lt;/a&gt; vymyslel. Nejdřív emoji převedu na text a pokud v sobě má „skin tone”, tak to ořežu a z textu vytvořím zpět emoji. Tím získám z barevných palečků žluté a počítám žluté.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uvažoval jsem, že mi už nevyhovuje nastavení administrativních dní na maily apod. a dní na hlubokou práci, tedy programování a psaní. Jako admin dny mám pondělky a středy, ale přednášky jsou většinou v úterý a zabijou většinou celý den. Ve čtvrtky chodím do kavárny a buď se tam nedokážu soustředit na hlubokou práci, protože na mě mluví kamarádi, nebo to dokážu, ale kamarádi vypadají zklamaní, že si s nimi nepovídám. Takže s tím asi nějak zamíchám.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Po přednášce s Matějem mi neplánovaně napsal kamarád, že potřebuje emoční podporu a šli jsme na pivo, ačkoliv jsem byl už dost zničený. S pivem jsem to pak přehnal a během středy jsem měl trochu kocovinu a trochu dost deficit spánku. Neměl jsem následně vůbec chuť přijít na &lt;a href="https://pyvo.cz/praha-pyvo/"&gt;pražské Pyvo&lt;/a&gt; v ten den večer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volal jsem si s jednou firmou. Aktuálně nebudou prodlužovat spolupráci, protože nemají kam dát juniory, dáme si vědět na začátku 2023. S jinou firmou zase jednáme po mailech o nejvyšším tarifu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jedna juniorka, kterou jsme spolu s Mews podpořili stipendiem, si našla práci.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jeden kluk, kterého jsme spolu s Mews podpořili stipendiem, to vzdal a nic z toho nebude. Takový je život.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Můj oblíbený Aerovod se sloučil s &lt;a href="https://kviff.tv/"&gt;KVIFF.TV&lt;/a&gt;, což nevím, jestli je dobře nebo špatně, ale věnoval jsem 30 minut tomu, abych podle toho upravil svou aplikaci na evidenci filmů v Trellu, &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/film2trello"&gt;film2trello&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Po přidání diagnostických příkazů do buildu na CircleCI se toto pondělí neopakovala chyba s porušenou databází. Ale pak jsem kód buildu stejně zase rozvrtal a databázi budu řešit všelijak jinak, takže je to už asi stejně bezpředmětné.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odpovídání v klubu, maily, a tak dále. Tohle mi zabralo snad dva celé dny z tohoto týdne. V klubu se toho dělo nějak hodně.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Úspěšně jsem si většinu týdne blokoval sociální sítě a čas jsem na nich trávil zcela minimálně.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 7 dní od 15.10. do 21.10. jsem při procházkách nachodil 4 km, na túrách nachodil 17 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 7 hodin a zdolal při tom 21 kilometrů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aktuální finanční výsledky, návštěvnost a další čísla k JG &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;mám přímo na webu&lt;/a&gt;. Nabídky práce pro juniory teď inzerují: &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/2b1ab731247b03b291bd7c4a0177e052df5ae4a5937144b4f2ce9d11/"&gt;Monitora media, s.r.o.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/dbbb7bf406b3c33aeba36cae817919d44bfb368a08fb1b4899dba130/"&gt;Processand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/215426887eaaad9105ecf647d0ff24cf94de7c9eb47cc6f2c55e6921/"&gt;Red Hat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tři věci, které bych chtěl zvládnout udělat příště:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dokončit rozvrtané spouštění skriptů, opravit build, předsunout jeden ze skriptů a rozchodit paralelizaci.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Propagovat novou epizodu podcastu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Napsat zase nějaký ten tip pro nováčky v klubu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-co-vy"&gt;A co vy?&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#a-co-vy" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud byste čistě náhodou měli dojem, že jste oproti mě za uplynulý týden vůbec nic nestihli, tak mám pro vás skvělou zprávu! V klidu se na ten dojem &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/neni-to-zavod/"&gt;můžete vykašlat&lt;/a&gt;. Není zač!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Když si něco přečtu nebo poslechnu a líbí se mi to, &lt;a href="https://getpocket.com/@honzajavorek"&gt;sdílím to na Pocketu&lt;/a&gt;. Od posledních poznámek jsem sdílel toto:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="prednaska-v-klubu-pavel-sabatka"&gt;Přednáška v klubu: Pavel Šabatka&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#prednaska-v-klubu-pavel-sabatka" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ve středu byla po dlouhé době přednáška v klubu. Pavel Šabatka z &lt;a href="https://www.houseofrezac.com/"&gt;House of Řezáč&lt;/a&gt; mluvil o tom, kdo je webový analytik a jak se jím stát. V průběhu odpoledne jsem zjistil, že moje checklisty toho, co a jak dělám, jsou neaktuální a nezahrnují poslední změny, které jsem dělal ohledně streamování na YouTube apod. Kvůli tomu jsem ztratil nějaký čas a byl jsem pak i nervózní, co ještě jsem kde zapomněl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když se Pavel připojil, řekl mi, že pozval kolegyni, aby se připojila taky, pod jeho účtem. Řekl jsem, že každý má 2 týdny zdarma, tak ať se klidně registruje za sebe, ale ze zvědavosti jsem šel na mobil a zkusil ze svého účtu jít do Discord callu, zatímco jsem na něm byl z počítače. Tím jsem rozstřelil nějaké nastavení a následujících 10 minut jsme řešili, že mě Pavel neslyší.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když jsme to vyřešili, zmáčkl jsem omylem ve stresu nahrávání místo streamování. Měl jsem tedy záznam, ale kdyby se připojilo více jak 25 lidí, bohužel by přednášku vidět nemohli. Také jsem tím spláchl asi půl hodiny příprav a přidělal si další půlhodinu nahrávání a upravování záznamu na YouTube po skončení přednášky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;25 lidí nehrozilo, dorazilo jen pár lidí, což mě trochu mrzelo. Uvidím, jak se povede návštěvnost přednášek rozdmýchat v dalších týdnech. Vím, že si to hodně lidí pouští ze záznamu, ale i tak. Pavel si s tím dal práci, přednáška byla dobrá, jeho kolegyně Katka tam říkala hodně dobré věci, celé to bylo fajn, čekali na dotazy. Bohužel tohle prostě neovlivním, lidi na přednášky upozorňuji, řekl bych, až skoro nadměrně.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="prace-na-tipech-pro-nove-cleny"&gt;Práce na tipech pro nové členy&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#prace-na-tipech-pro-nove-cleny" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mám pocit, že tipy a celý onboarding dělám už celou věčnost. Kvůli tomu mě to už trochu přestává bavit. Nevím, jestli tomu mám rychle najít nějaký konec a dodělat to jen v rámci určitého &lt;em&gt;scope&lt;/em&gt;, nebo prostě zatnout zuby a pokračovat spolu s tím, že pro rozptýlení se občas podívám na jiné, méně důležité úkoly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Napsal jsem dva tipy, jeden o tom, aby se lidi nebáli ptát na věci ve veřejných kanálech, druhý o tom, že mají preferovat veřejné kanály oproti soukromým zprávám. Ten druhý vyvolal nějaké reakce a zjistil jsem, že může existovat spousta lidí, kteří Discord a celkově chat používají úplně jinak, než já nebo Dan. Vedli jsme ohledně toho dlouhou (ale zcela konstruktivní) debatu, která mě přesvědčila, že soukromé zprávy se nemám nijak snažit omezovat a že to vlastně ani nejde. Tip jsem stáhl a napíšu ho jinak, víc jako doporučení a nastínění výhod a nevýhod různých přístupů.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jsem teď přesvědčený, že pokud chci, aby lidi víc psali veřejně, musím zapracovat na &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_safety"&gt;psychological safety&lt;/a&gt; v klubu a na institucionalizovaných příležitostech, kde půjde přispět i jednoduše a malinko.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Následně jsem napsal ještě další dva tipy, jeden žádající lidi o feedback a druhý o placení v klubu. V tom prvním se ptám lidí na tři věci:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Díky čemu nebo komu víš, že junior.guru existuje? Google? Doporučení? Sociální síť? Podcasty?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Co se ti tu líbí? Co tě příjemně překvapilo? Co si nejvíc užíváš?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Co ti tu chybí? Co se ti tu nelíbí? Co by šlo vylepšit? Z čeho máš blbý pocit?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tím se konečně dostávám k tomu, abych zjišťoval data, která potřebuji pro překopání svého marketingu. Zatím jich moc neodpovědělo. Mám podezření, že vlastně lidi ty tipy přestali trochu číst. Je to ale pouze pocit, možná kdybych měl nějaká čísla, tak to vidím jinak. Časem se musím zamyslet, jestli neposílat víc kratších tipů než méně delších, nebo jestli lidem tipy nepřipomenout, pokud o ně třeba týden nejeví zájem, protože je mohou ignorovat i omylem, nejen záměrně.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upravil jsem &lt;em&gt;allowed mentions&lt;/em&gt; v tipech tak, aby tam byli všichni, koho tipy označují (abych nějak řešil &lt;a href="https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/issues/2126"&gt;problém popsaný tady&lt;/a&gt;), kromě moderátorů (aby nedostávali zbytečné notifikace). Nevím, jestli to pomohlo a v tipech se budou označení lidi zobrazovat jménem a ne číslem, nicméně víc už pro to udělat nemůžu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pozitivní je, že jsem vlastně tento týden dokázal, i přes veškerou prokrastinaci a další úkoly, sepsat čtyři nové tipy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="stourani-do-infrastruktury"&gt;Šťourání do infrastruktury&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#stourani-do-infrastruktury" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Při pátku už se mi nechtělo psát zase tipy, tak jsem si řekl, že se podívám na chybu SQLite &lt;em&gt;database disk image is malformed&lt;/em&gt;, která mi shazuje build na CI. Děje se to jen občas, ale dost pravidelně. Děje se to zhruba od doby, co jsem nasadil novou verzi robota na pracovní nabídky, tedy po paměti asi od února nebo března. Celou tu dobu se to děje a já to neřeším.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koukáním na buildy jsem zjistil, že se to asi děje každé pondělí. Děje se to v nightly buildu na hlavní Git větvi, ale i pro větve, které vzniknou díky dependabotu. Je to zvláštní. Pondělí se nijak neliší od jiných dní, akorát se posílají maily inzerentům. Že by to nějak ovlivňovaly? Bude to nějaký problém s kešováním nebo ukládáním dat mezi jednotlivými fázemi buildu na CircleCI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/5275022/325365"&gt;Tady na SO&lt;/a&gt; jsem našel tuhle větu, kterou si sem odložím, ale podle mě to není můj případ:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure figure-blockquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should not use traditional backup tools for SQLite (or any other database, for that matter), since they do not take into account the DB state information that is critical to ensure an uncorrupted database. Especially, copying the DB files in the middle of an insert transaction is a recipe for disaster...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Přidal jsem několik debugovacích výpisů a teď asi nezbývá, než čekat na pondělí a celkově to víc pozorovat. Použil jsem &lt;a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/"&gt;sqlite-utils&lt;/a&gt; od svého oblíbence &lt;a href="https://simonwillison.net/"&gt;Simona Willisona&lt;/a&gt;, abych nad databází pustil nějaké příkazy mimo svůj kód a abych ji optimalizoval před tím, než se bude zálohovat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Při koukání na buildy jsem si všiml, že mi samo CircleCI radí, &lt;a href="https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference/#resourceclass"&gt;abych si zvýšil &lt;em&gt;resourceclass&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, což jsem neznal. Zjednodušeně je to způsob, jak CircleCI říct, že má na určitý úkol pustit mašinu těžšího kalibru. Díky silnějšímu CPU a více paměti se pak věc stihne rychleji. Tak jsem to tam do několika míst dal. V souvislosti s tím jsem si všiml, jaké vymakané grafy teďka na CircleCI jsou, fakt dobrý:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="CircleCI Timing" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/circleci-timing.png" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="CircleCI Resources" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/circleci-resources.png" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taky jsem si při tom všiml, že bych měl možná pořídit nějakou tu CDN, protože mi CircleCI lehce naznačuje, že si tam ukládám něco, co bych si měl ukládat spíš jinam, ehm:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="CircleCI Storage" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/circleci-storage.png" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když k tomu připočítám podcast a generované obrázky, které mi zabírají čím dál tím víc místa někde v Git repozitářích, možná by se fakt CDNka hodila. Nejspíš jsem teď ale líný to řešit. Taky je asi možnost nějak se domluvit v &lt;a href="https://www.cdn77.com/"&gt;CDN77.com&lt;/a&gt;, když už JG podporují. Netuším, jaké jsou jejich výhody nebo nevýhody oproti jiným řešením, ale tuším, že pro účely JG to bude fuk. Na obrázky teda už teď používám &lt;a href="https://cloudinary.com/"&gt;Cloudinary&lt;/a&gt;, v rámci jejich tarifu zdarma, ale to je trochu něco jiného.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když už jsem se šťoural v tom CI, napadlo mě, že zbytek pátku využiju na to, abych (opět) překopal způsob, jakým se pouští skripty na JG. Relativně nedávno jsem zaváděl &lt;a href="https://www.pyinvoke.org/"&gt;invoke&lt;/a&gt; místo už-ani-nevím-čeho, ale spokojený jsem s tím nebyl. Zřejmě jsou mé potřeby už dost specifické. A to, co dělá invoke dobře, už by se dal stejně dobře použít i &lt;a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/"&gt;click&lt;/a&gt;, který je podle mě mnohem méně magický.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aktuálně jsem do clicku přepsal vše kromě té největší části, která má na starost spouštění skriptů na CI a stahování a synchronizaci všech dat. Bylo to dost jednoduché a už teď se těším, až přepíšu i tu složitou část. V novějších verzích clicku jsou navíc věci, které se mi budou hodit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/commands/#custom-multi-commands"&gt;Custom Multi Commands&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/commands/#multi-command-chaining"&gt;Multi Command Chaining&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/commands/#group-invocation-without-command"&gt;Group Invocation Without Command&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/advanced/#invoking-other-commands"&gt;Invoking Other Commands&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cílem změn bude, abych mohl:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pustit například &lt;code&gt;jg sync podcast&lt;/code&gt; a ono by mě to upozornilo, že tahle věc závisí na &lt;code&gt;jg sync club-content&lt;/code&gt; a jestli náhodou nechci spustit nejdřív to, nebo ať si &lt;code&gt;podcast&lt;/code&gt; teda na vlastní nebezpečí spustím bez toho, pokud si myslím, že data z &lt;code&gt;club-content&lt;/code&gt; mám dost čerstvá. Toto je něco, co teď JG neumí a při vývoji mi to háže klacky pod nohy doslova každý den.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pustit například &lt;code&gt;jg sync events --flush-images&lt;/code&gt;, aby se přegenerovaly všechny plakátky k akcím v klubu. Tohle teď JG taky neumí a patlám to přes nějaké environment proměnné.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automaticky paralelizovat při výoji i na CI stahování věcí, které na sobě nezávisí, ale zároveň aby se dodržovalo pořadí věcí, které na sobě závisí. To znamená, že možná budu mít i separátní databáze pro každý skript a pak je budu nějak spojovat, ale kdo ví.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Využít nějak &lt;a href="https://circleci.com/blog/a-guide-to-test-splitting/"&gt;vestavěné paralelizace na CircleCI&lt;/a&gt;! Sice nepotřebuji paralelizovat testy, potřebuji to udělat se skripty, ale to by mohlo být celkem jedno, princip je stejný.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Už mě nebaví, jak mi buildy jedou 40 minut. Jasně, něco by šlo optimalizovat a zrychlit, ale něco prostě zrychlit nepůjde, protože se tam stahuje hodně věcí, nebo se dělá hodně věcí přes Discord API. Potřebuji ty skripty pouštět vedle sebe a ne za sebou, jak jen to půjde.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zapojeni-dvou-juniorek-do-open-source"&gt;Zapojení dvou juniorek do open source&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#zapojeni-dvou-juniorek-do-open-source" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Povedlo se mi shodou okolností motivovat hned dvě juniorky do práce na open source. Snažil jsem se dělat review a odpovídat na zprávy, ale stejně mám pocit, že to většinou stálo na mně. Lepší už to nebude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markéta se &lt;a href="https://github.com/pyvec/docs.pyvec.org/pull/292"&gt;pustila do opravy jednoho skriptu&lt;/a&gt;, který nám v Pyvci pomáhá dokumentovat udělené granty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mia přepsala &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/pyvo_bot"&gt;mého Pyvo bota&lt;/a&gt; do Pythonu a vytvořila &lt;a href="https://github.com/pyvec/pyvo-bot/"&gt;pyvec/pyvo-bot&lt;/a&gt;. V průběhu týdne jsme si ověřili, že funguje, zpráva přišla :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="socialni-site-a-mimo-agendu"&gt;Sociální sítě a Mimo agendu&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#socialni-site-a-mimo-agendu" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Přestávají mě bavit sociální sítě. Poslední hřebíček byl &lt;a href="https://mimo-agendu.ghost.io/nasel-jsem-recept-na-twitter/"&gt;článek Jakuba Zelenky&lt;/a&gt;, kvůli kterému jsem si dokonce konečně Mimo agendu předplatil. Při čtení dalších jeho článků jsem si uvědomil, jak mě vlastně nebaví ani zpravodajství. Rezonoval se mnou i &lt;a href="https://www.reflex.cz/clanek/prostor-x/114555/budar-herectvi-mi-prestalo-davat-smysl-ceske-komedie-me-nebavi-ani-jako-divaka-smrt-v-sobe-mame-vsichni.html"&gt;rozhovor na Prostoru X&lt;/a&gt;, kde Budař mluví o tom, jak vůbec nesleduje politiku. Celé to ještě zpracovávám, žádný závěr z toho nemám. Po nocích jsem četl další Jakubovy články, např. o TikToku a mám v hlavě spoustu myšlenek a otázek. Debatoval jsem pak i s Jakubem a dalšími na jeho Discordu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Láká mě výrazně si sociální sítě omezit a z některých třeba úplně odejít. Zároveň to nemůžu udělat, protože sociální sítě jsou pilíř marketingu mého projektu. Junioři mě ještě možná najdou přes Google, ale firmy žhavím podle mě hlavně přes LinkedIn. Možná budu primárně používat ten a řešit tam jen práci?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1579932185750298624"&gt;Napsal jsem o svém zpruzení na sociální síť&lt;/a&gt; a lidé mi odepisovali strategie, ve kterých věnují mnoho energie na to, aby si své sociální sítě nějak čistili a upravovali a odplevelovali. Jednak to taky dělám a zjevně to nepomáhá, jednak je otázka, zda chci něčemu takovému vůbec věnovat čas? Co mi vlastně sociální sítě dávají kromě (v případě neplaceného, stále mizernějšího) dosahu pro moji propagaci JG?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Možná je to jen nějaké pokračování mého vyhoření ze sociálních sítí, když jsem je začal víc používat pro práci. Možná jsou opravdu hodně jiné, než dřív, a možná jsem si toho konečně všiml. Možná jsem zklamaný, že nic, co se na sociálních sítích psalo, se ve výsledku nepromítlo do voleb, a proto mi ve výsledku přijde zbytečné s nimi trávit čas. Reálný svět je totiž nakonec asi opravdu někde jinde, tam venku.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zjistil jsem, že Instagram jde používat z webu na noťasu a konečně lze takto i nahrát obrázek. Dokonce, když jdu do devtools v prohlížeči a přepnu se jakoby na mobilní prohlížeč, tak mohu nahrát i storíčko. Nelze ale např. nasdílet svůj post jako storíčko apod. Bez ohledu na to jsem zajásal a IG si úplně odinstaloval z mobilu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hlavně pro zlepšení produktivity jsem si začal sociální sítě během většiny dne blokovat přes &lt;code&gt;/etc/hosts&lt;/code&gt;. Jsem zvědav, jak dlouho mi tohle vydrží.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aby to bylo kompletní, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1580656545003491328"&gt;objevil se&lt;/a&gt; jeden můj zarytý twitterový fanoušek. Je to myslím jeden ze tří lidí, které si tam blokuju. Pořád mi něco psali, aniž by to dávalo smysl, nebo aniž bych jich prosil o názor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kromě &lt;a href="http://junior.guru/api/events.ics"&gt;veřejného iCalendar exportu přednášek&lt;/a&gt; jsem vytvořil ještě jeden, který je přímo pro mě. Označí mi v kalendáři výrazněji každý den, kdy je přednáška a v ten den mi automaticky na dopoledne přidá několikahodinový blok, kdy se věnuji rodině jako náhradu za večerní absenci.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Třídění akcí &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/events/"&gt;na webu&lt;/a&gt; fungovalo na bázi dní a ne času. Stalo se, že mi běžel build krátce po přednášce a zjistil jsem, že pak rozdělení na plánované a archivované nefunguje dobře a něco i spadne. Opravil jsem to tak, aby se pracovalo s &lt;code&gt;datetime&lt;/code&gt; místo &lt;code&gt;date&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vyladil jsem některá doporučení pro členy v klubu, aby používaly české názvy Discord UI a anglické vždy až v závorce. Díky nedávné anketě v klubu totiž vím, že většina lidí používá Discord s českým UI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opravil jsem nějaké chyby v &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/speaker/"&gt;informacích pro přednášející&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upravil jsem skripty, které do některých kanálů na Discordu posílají pravidelná upozornění, aby při každém novém vždy smazali předchozí upozornění. Díky tomu se nebudou kanály plevelit těmito automatickými zprávami.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Udělil jsem jedno stipendium.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sdílel jsem &lt;a href="https://bit.ly/3e8lGdm"&gt;informace o akci&lt;/a&gt;, kterou pořádáme společně s Ataccama, a to do klubu, na všechny svoje sociální sítě a na všechny možné Facebook skupiny.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psal jsem si s &lt;a href="https://www.lukasaugusta.cz/"&gt;Lukášem Augustou&lt;/a&gt; o jeho nové službě &lt;a href="https://www.designui.cz/landing-page-odshora-az-dolu?referral_code=31kql18"&gt;Landing page odshora až dolů&lt;/a&gt; a dělal jsem jí i trochu promo v klubu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během celého týdne jsem ladil detaily ohledně přednášek, ať už těch naplánovaných, nebo nových. Tisíc drobných editací souboru &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/junior.guru/blob/main/juniorguru/data/events.yml"&gt;events.yml&lt;/a&gt;, maily firmám s prosbou o logo, apod.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odpovídání v klubu, maily, a tak dále. Komunikoval jsem docela s lidmi na LinkedIn, ať už kvůli přednáškám nebo spolupráci. Ozval jsem se několika firmám, kterým brzy vyprší nebo nedávno vypršela spolupráce v klubu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 7 dní od 8.10. do 14.10. jsem při procházkách nachodil 9 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 4 hodiny a zdolal při tom 9 kilometrů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aktuální finanční výsledky, návštěvnost a další čísla k JG &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;mám přímo na webu&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Tři věci, které bych chtěl zvládnout udělat příště:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zvládnout v úterý další přednášku v klubu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dokončit rozvrtané spouštění skriptů a plně přejít z invoke na click.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Napsat zase nějaký ten tip pro nováčky v klubu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-co-vy"&gt;A co vy?&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#a-co-vy" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud byste čistě náhodou měli dojem, že jste oproti mě za uplynulý týden vůbec nic nestihli, tak mám pro vás skvělou zprávu! V klidu se na ten dojem &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/neni-to-zavod/"&gt;můžete vykašlat&lt;/a&gt;. Není zač!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Když si něco přečtu nebo poslechnu a líbí se mi to, &lt;a href="https://getpocket.com/@honzajavorek"&gt;sdílím to na Pocketu&lt;/a&gt;. Od posledních poznámek jsem sdílel toto:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hodně času jsem strávil dolaďováním a plánováním přednášek. Aktuálně jsem ve stavu, že jsem zaplnil kalendář až do Mikuláše. Pak si dám možná už rovnou nějakou vánoční pauzu. Během té bych se měl zamyslet, jak příště na přednášení pozvat víc ženských. Asi prostě budu na leden a dál zvát pro změnu zas jenom ženské, ať se to trochu srovná.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Všechny naplánované přednášky jsou na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/events/"&gt;stránce s akcemi v klubu&lt;/a&gt;. První přednáška bude už ve středu příští týden. Jsem trochu ve stresu, protože po dlouhé pauze už upřímně vůbec netuším, jakým způsobem jsem dělal přednášky v klubu a určitě to nějak pokazím a na něco zapomenu. Mám naštěstí aspoň &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/honzajavorek/b1a77651e566cb6405a131bbf1fb0692"&gt;check list&lt;/a&gt;, ale ten taky není všespásný.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vylepsovani-skriptu-na-oznamovani-prednasek"&gt;Vylepšování skriptu na oznamování přednášek&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#vylepsovani-skriptu-na-oznamovani-prednasek" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Po čase jsem se vrátil k myšlence, že by mohlo jít přes bota nahrávat obrázek k Discord eventu. Předchozí pokusy se mi nějak nedařily, nepřišel jsem na to, jak to udělat a akorát jsem založil &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/72134026/325365"&gt;dotaz na SO&lt;/a&gt;, který nikdo neodpověděl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když jsem se do toho trochu ponořil a četl jsem si kód pycordu, zjistil jsem, že parametr na nahrávání obrázku nepřijímá &lt;code&gt;Asset&lt;/code&gt;, ale normálně bajty s obrázkem. Je to akorát špatně zdokumentováno!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takže jsem poslal &lt;a href="https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord/pull/1667"&gt;opravu&lt;/a&gt; a tím jsem poprvé přispěl do pycordu :) Na svou SO otázku jsem &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/73989454/325365"&gt;napsal vlastní odpověď&lt;/a&gt;. A naimplementoval jsem nahrávání obrázku. Musel jsem vygenerovat obrázek pro Discordí rozměr, aby se nikde neořezával. Tento rozměr není moc vysoký a nešlo tam nacpat vše, co je na aktuálním plakátu, takže jsem pomocí media query v CSS zajistil, že se určité kousky plakátku schovají, když má být výsledek moc nízký na výšku.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Díky tomu, že mají teď Discord eventy obrázky, začal jsem dávat do různých automatických oznámení v klubu odkazy přímo na ně. Touto změnou jsem způsobil několik chyb, které jsem v dalších dnech postupně opravoval. S výsledkem jsem ale spokojen, lidi se teď mohou rovnou z oznámení na eventy přihlašovat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="prosekani-seo-lapacu"&gt;Prosekání „SEO lapačů“&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#prosekani-seo-lapacu" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brutálně jsem prosekal „SEO lapače“, které jsem měl na různá klíčová slova, např. tento na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/topics/adventofcode/"&gt;Advent of Code&lt;/a&gt;. Měl jsem tam snad 40 různých klíčových slov, které se hledaly v klubu a prezentovaly na takovýchto podobných stránkách.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Už dlouhou dobu jsem sledoval, že nejvýkonnější jsou lapače, které jsou o vzdělávacích agenturách, tedy o kurzech. Nejdřív mi o tom chodily maily z Google Console, pak jsem to viděl už i &lt;a href="https://simpleanalytics.com/junior.guru?search=paths%3Atopics&amp;amp;period=year&amp;amp;count=1"&gt;přímo v Simple Analytics&lt;/a&gt;. Do těch jsem se teď podíval a co mělo méně než zhruba 30-40 návštěv za celý rok, to jsem zrušil. Prakticky jsem tedy zrušil veškeré lapače na technologie, asi až na Python a JavaScript, kam lidi opravdu chodí. Git a GitHub jsem přesměroval na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/handbook/git/"&gt;stránku v příručce&lt;/a&gt;, i když není úplně dopsaná. Lapač na Learn2Code jsem přesměroval a upravil, protože se přejmenovali na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/topics/skillmea/"&gt;Skillmea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Užíval jsem si týden, kdy jsem nešel na žádnou akci a ničeho jsem se neúčastnil. Bylo to osvěžující. Několik akcí v budoucnu jsem z různých nesouvisejících důvodů odmítl a nevadí mi to. Jsem zřejmě přesocializovaný a potřebuji dobít baterky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přesměroval jsem všechny historické stránky příručky pod &lt;code&gt;/handbook/&lt;/code&gt;, se všemi přesměrováními a s opravami odkazů napříč celým webem. Na starých stránkách webu, kam jsem se už dlouho nedíval, jsem našel hromadu neaktuálních odkazů, které jsem taky v rámci možností opravoval.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Napsal jsem pár lidem, kteří dostali stipendium a zeptal se jich, jak se jim daří. Jedna členka odepsala, že si našla práci!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přečetl jsem vše v klubu, podíval jsem se tam na několik výrobků a CVček.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opravil jsem skript, který mi na webu kontroluje rozbité odkazy. Neuměl se vypořádat s odkazy na obrázky. Upřímně nerozumím tomu, proč se to projevilo až teď.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Měli jsme schůzi výboru Pyvce. Pořešili jsme pár věcí. Vyčistil jsem náš Trello workspace od starých Trello boardů. Napsal jsem advokátce, aby nám pomohla upravit stanovy. Vzal jsem &lt;a href="https://blog.python.cz/Letni-sprinty-Python-komunity-v-Msenem"&gt;čerstvě vydaný článek na českém Python blogu o letních sprintech&lt;/a&gt; a nasdílel ho aspoň na Facebook a Twitter. Na Facebooku se pod ním tradičně objevily debilní komentáře a já si zase uvědomil, jak na tu sociální síť už fakt nějak nemám nervy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Všiml jsem si, že je asi nějaká chyba ve &lt;a href="https://github.com/pyvec/docs.pyvec.org/blob/master/_scripts/generate_grants.py"&gt;skriptu&lt;/a&gt;, který Pyvci dokumentuje přidělené granty. Informace jsou &lt;a href="https://github.com/pyvec/docs.pyvec.org/pull/292"&gt;tady v komentářích&lt;/a&gt;. Kdo umíte kódit v Pythonu, pomoc vítána.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vylepšil jsem pravidelnou zprávu, kterou bot posílá do kanálu v klubu, kde se řeší CV, GitHub, LinkedIn. Dává lidem tipy na věci, které si mají přečíst, než nás budou žádat o zpětnou vazbu, třeba &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/handbook/cv/"&gt;návod na CV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Propagoval jsem na sociálních sítích &lt;a href="https://streetofcode.sk/podcast/juniorguru"&gt;svou účast v podcastu Street of Code&lt;/a&gt;. Epizodu jsem si pouštěl do vlastních uší a bylo to tak dobré, jak jsem si to pamatoval z nahrávání. Tenhle rozhovor se nám fakt povedl a jsou v něm věci, které jsem jinde neříkal :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Propagoval jsem na sociálních sítích středeční &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/events/"&gt;přednášku v klubu s Pavlem Šabatkou o tom, jak se stát webovým analytikem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vymyslel jsem, jak rozdám &lt;a href="https://www.vzhurudolu.cz/css-layout/"&gt;knihy od Martina Michálka&lt;/a&gt;, kterých mám pět kusů na rozdávání v klubu. Lidi budou psát, s čím v CSS měli největší problém a jak to případně překonali. Z respondentů pak vylosuju pět, kteří knížku dostanou. Soutěž jsem v klubu rovnou dnes zahájil, bude trvat do prvního listopadu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Z &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/handbook/learn/"&gt;této stránky&lt;/a&gt; jsem vyčlenil jednu sekci do &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/handbook/help/"&gt;separátní kapitoly&lt;/a&gt;. Chci ji přepsat, rozšířit, vylepšit. Cílem je, aby mi pak odkaz na tuto stránku pomohl s onboardingem členů do klubu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Začalo mi padat CI a bot kvůli tomu několik dní nejel. Když jsem se konečně dostal k debugování, zjistil jsem, že to dělá nový argument &lt;code&gt;suppress&lt;/code&gt;, který jsem v pycordu začal používat hned po vydání nové verze knihovny. Bohužel zjevně nefunguje moc dobře. Založil jsem &lt;a href="https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord/issues/1674"&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; a opravil jsem kód tak, aby problém obešel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na chvíli jsem se vrátil k programování skriptu na nahrávání souborů na iCloud, který využívá &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/pyicloud/"&gt;pyicloud&lt;/a&gt; a který chci používat k nějakým zálohám, ale moc jsem na tom neudělal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minulý týden jsem se tady chlubil, jak se mi povedlo jednoduchým skriptem udělat podcast z jednoho video pořadu. Tak po pár dnech provozu to spadlo, protože tam vznikaly velké audio soubory a limit na GitHub Pages je 100 MB :D Takže jsem to vypnul. Nemám po ruce žádnou CDN, kam bych to nahrával, a hlavně jsem neměl teď čas si s tím nějak dál hrát.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odpovídání v klubu, maily, a tak dále. Komunikoval jsem s jednou firmou ohledně prodloužení partnerství s klubem. S jinou firmou jsem o tom komunikovat měl, ale nějak jsem to nezvládl.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Velkou část týdne jsem se také snažil být co nejlepším kamarádem dvěma kamarádům, kteří ve svých životech zrovna řeší nějaký shit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 7 dní od 1.10. do 7.10. jsem při procházkách nachodil 13 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 7 hodin a zdolal při tom 13 kilometrů.&lt;/li&gt;

Nemám šéfa, kterému bych reportoval každý svůj krok, ale mám &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/club/"&gt;klub&lt;/a&gt;, a členy by mohlo zajímat, jestli se neflákám. Taky je to způsob, jak se sám doma nezbláznit a nepropadat pocitu, že je zase konec týdne a já jsem přitom nestihl nic udělat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Byl nějaký ten státní svátek, volby a tak různě, takže píšu až po dvou týdnech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="chyba-s-vytvarenim-kategorii-na-discordu"&gt;Chyba s vytvářením kategorií na Discordu&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#chyba-s-vytvarenim-kategorii-na-discordu" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jak jsem psal v některých předchozích poznámkách, jedna kategorie na Discordu může mít maximálně 50 kanálů a tak musím kanály s tipy pro nové členy v klubu rozdělovat do víc kategorií. Způsob rozdělování měl ale chyby a padalo mi to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zkusil jsem to naprogramovat jinak, ale po celém dni předělávání jsem došel opět k řešení, které mělo nějaké vady a nefungovalo dobře. Protože se tipy posílají paralelně a dělá to rovnou změny na Discordu, nedařilo se mi ani najít jednoduchý způsob, jak algoritmus izolovat od I/O, abych ho mohl nějak neprůstřelně otestovat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nakonec jsem do toho prostě bušil tak dlouho, až jsem vynalezl něco, co vypadá, že funguje.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vitani-novych-clenu"&gt;Vítání nových členů&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#vitani-novych-clenu" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uvědomil jsem si, že mě nebaví vítat nové členy, protože je to vysilující. Spolu s Danem jsme hned u každého pod jeho přivítáním rozebrali kariérní možnosti a ptali se na otázky, které měly druhou stranu dovést k nějakému posunu. Jenže to neškáluje a cítil jsem, že já na tom vyhořívám a Dan na tom prokrastinuje, ale asi by časem taky vyhoříval. Navíc se nikdo další velmi nezapojoval, protože si netroufl předvádět tam podobné rozbory jako my s Danem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Přijde mi, že nemůžeme každému příchozímu hned rozebrat kariéru. Není to v našich silách a vlastně mi ani nedává smysl dávat každému, kdo zrovna nakoukne do klubu a má dva týdny zdarma, plný servis kariérového poradenství. Zároveň nechceme, aby vítání ztratilo lidský rozměr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Budeme se tedy s Danem snažit vítat „povrchněji“. Uvidíme, jak nám to půjde, protože nejen Dana, ale i mě, samozřejmě svrbí vždy prsty a hned bychom radili. Budeme prostě hlavně &lt;strong&gt;vítat&lt;/strong&gt; a méně &lt;strong&gt;radit&lt;/strong&gt;, případně lidi směrovat do kanálů, které je mohou zajímat. Toto je navíc činnost, se kterou nám může snadno kdokoliv pomoci.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pohrávám si s myšlenkou, že by bot pro každého nového člena losoval někoho ze stávajících členů - např. těch, kdo jsou v klubu už rok a déle a vědí, jak to tam chodí, a poprosil ho, aby se zapojil a napsal nově příchozímu třeba i jen jednu, klidně krátkou, ale hezkou lidskou větu. Vlastně skoro takový lehký &lt;em&gt;buddy&lt;/em&gt; program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lidé se pak sami mohou na cokoliv zeptat v příslušných kanálech, pokud chtějí. Donutí je to možná zformulovat obecnější dotaz a zároveň kanály čte víc lidí, takže se rozproudí diskuze, kde k tomu může něco říct víc členů.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Píšu to tu jako hotovou věc, ale reálně mi trvalo třeba týden, než jsem si toto řešení v hlavě ujasnil. Probíral jsem to hodně s Danem, probíral jsem to s kamarádem na pivu, myslel jsem na to ve sprše, prostě si to vzalo hodně přemítání a ujasňování. Nakonec jsem to navrhl členům a ti mi stvrdili, že to je dobrý směr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dva-tipy-pro-nove-cleny"&gt;Dva tipy pro nové členy&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dva-tipy-pro-nove-cleny" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Konečně se mi povedlo pohnout i s dalšími tipy pro nové členy a dopsal jsem tip, který vysvětluje Discord role v klubu. Potom jsem začal psát tip, který se zabývá tím, jak mají lidi v klubu komunikovat a kam mají co psát, ale ten mě přivedl na myšlenku, že ještě před ním by měl jít tip o pravidlech chování a respektujícím a podporujícím prostředí v klubu. Takže ten jsem pak psal většinu dneška.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pulmaraton"&gt;Půlmaraton&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#pulmaraton" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Před několika měsíci mě kamarádi vyhecovali, abych se přihlásil na Půlmaraton Moravským krasem, který se běžel 28.9. v Blansku. O víkendu jsem si teda šel zaběhat a natáhl jsem to na 20 km, abych tušil, jestli na půlmaratonu spíš umřu, nebo spíš ne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pak jsem sjel do Blanska, kam jezdí přímý vlak z Prahy, setkal se s kamarády, zaběhli jsme to, večer dali v Brně pivko, přespal jsem u kamaráda a odjel zpátky do Prahy. Autobusem, protože ten je teď bohužel výrazně méně zoufalý, než výlukový vlak přes Vysočinu. Autobusem jsem nejel hodně dlouho, všude jezdím vlakem, takže mě fascinovalo, jak tam sedíme jako sardinky a jak ta věc může jezdit i doleva nebo doprava a předjíždět jiné hýbající se věci.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Závod mi sedl. Cítil jsem se strašně fajn, vtipkoval jsem se spoluběžci i s fanoušky podél trati, celou dobu se mi běželo dobře a cítil jsem se dobře. Bylo to na hranici mých sil, ale strašně jsem si to užil a v závěru jsem si ještě i zasprintoval. Neoficiální čas naměřený Stravou mám 1:49:16, délka byla 20.43 km, tempo 5:21 na km.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="volby"&gt;Volby&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#volby" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proběhly volby. Já sice kandidoval, ale záměrně na nevolitelném místě, pouze jsem chtěl Zelené na Praze 3 svou kandidaturou podpořit. Celkem jsem dostal 1.237 hlasů. Shrnutí voleb za sebe jsem &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/honzajavorek/posts/pfbid02EbxJML2KR964jVYznvFcwdWqp779TsWWkgLozn65pz8Jaudh7FxM6RDLkcUnt13yl"&gt;napsal na Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, zde kopie:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure figure-blockquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tak, a je to. Jsem rád, že mnou podporovaní &lt;a href="https://praha3.zeleni.cz/"&gt;Zelení Praha 3&lt;/a&gt; zůstávají na radnici a snad to dopadne dobře i se skládáním progresivní koalice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vyzkoušel jsem si, jaké to je podpořit veřejně nějakou politickou stranu, jaké to je být na její kandidátce, jaké to je dostat od nich tričko a stát s nimi na ulici a bavit se s voliči.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Překvapilo mě, že dění v městské části sleduji zjevně natolik, že jsem lidem byl schopen v pohodě říct, kde se co plánuje, kde bude jaká stavba, nebo že existuje &lt;a href="https://www.cistatrojka.cz/"&gt;Čistá Trojka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.praha3.cz/projekty/antigraffiti-program"&gt;Antigrafitti program&lt;/a&gt;, apod. Přitom jsem obyčejný občan a jen čtu sociální sítě, kam se tyhle věci dávají. Lidi, zajímejte se o svoje okolí! 🙂 Sledujte aspoň profily své městské části, jako je &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/praha3.cz/"&gt;Praha 3&lt;/a&gt;. Možná se budete méně divit, možná se o spoustě věcí dovíte mnohem dřív, než vám vyrostou za domem, možná k tomu budete moci i něco říct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teď si snad dám od politiky zase chvíli klid. Volby přímo v místě, kde žiju, a které na další 4 roky ovlivňují, jak se nám tu bude bydlet, chodit po ulici, hrát na pískovišti, apod., pro mě byly nakonec hrozné nervy. Možná mi na výsledku záleželo až příliš, ačkoliv mě osobně o nic nešlo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sice budou brzo volby prezidentské, ale ty jsou mi naštěstí dostatečně jedno a tak snad nebude problém si je co nejvíc vyblokovat a věnovat se teď zas víc tomu, co se děje v mojem podnikání, co aktuálně frčí na pískovištích a kdo vítězí na okruzích Formule 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pokud vím, koalice na Praze 3 ani na velké Praze nejsou zatím dojednány, takže výsledky voleb jsou sice známy, ale kdo bude vládnout, to jisté zatím vůbec není. Volby jsem sledoval s velkým napětím a nemohl jsem na to vůbec přestat přemýšlet. Stále jsem něco psal do sousedských aj. skupin na Facebooku, kde to taky různě vřelo, až jsem si v jeden moment musel sociální sítě vyloženě zablokovat, abych vůbec něco udělal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Po volbách jsem měl plnou hlavu myšlenek o tom, co se dalo udělat jinak nebo nad čím se zamyslet, včetně teorií, proč jaká místní strana dostala kolik hlasů. To jsem nakonec všechno napsal do napůl interní skupiny pro příznivce Zelených na Praze 3 a tím jsem téma na chvíli ve své hlavě uzavřel a uložil k ledu, přesně jak jsem napsal do toho statusu na Facebooku. Zkusím si teď dát od politiky trochu detox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="chyby-ktere-neumim-vyresit"&gt;Chyby, které neumím vyřešit&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#chyby-ktere-neumim-vyresit" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Z ničeho nic mi začalo &lt;code&gt;gulp-purgecss&lt;/code&gt; vyhazovat toto:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;[18:26:01] 'minifyCSS' errored after 333 ms

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nepřišel jsem na to, jak to debugovat. Jak mám udělat, aby se vypsala celá stacktrace. Taky se to děje jen když to mám lokálně ve &lt;em&gt;watch&lt;/em&gt; módu a ne při jednorázovém buildu nebo na produkci. Vzdal jsem to a minifikaci CSS jsem z &lt;em&gt;watch&lt;/em&gt; módu zatím vyhodil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Další věc, chodí mi nějaké chyby kvůli emailům. Robot posílá inzerentům každé pondělí informace o inzerátu. Používá k tomu SMTP mého osobního mailu na Gmailu, &lt;code&gt;jan.javorek@gmail.com&lt;/code&gt;. Do kopie dává &lt;code&gt;honza@junior.guru&lt;/code&gt;, což je ale jen &lt;a href="https://improvmx.com/"&gt;ImprovMX&lt;/a&gt; alias pro tentýž Gmail. Aby mi ty maily taky přišly. Inzerentům to přijde, ale mě se to vrací s chybama:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přidal jsem do hlavního menu na JG odkaz na Podcast jako na čtvrtou hlavní věc, kterou JG produkuje (tři další jsou Příručka, Práce, Klub). Dalo trochu práci to odladit v novém i starém designu a na malých obrazovkách.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publikoval jsem stránku &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/handbook/mental-health/"&gt;Psychika na cestě do IT&lt;/a&gt;, na které spolu s &lt;a href="https://www.nelaprovazi.cz/"&gt;Nelou&lt;/a&gt; děláme dlouhé měsíce a teď se nám ji konečně povedlo dodělat a dát ven. Zatím kolem toho nebudu dělat humbuk, takže jen větička tady, promo uděláme později.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upravil jsem skript, který mi generuje šablonu pro týdenní poznámky. Nyní do ní přidává odkazy na aktuální nabídky práce inzerované na junior.guru.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upgradoval jsem MkDocs a zjistil jsem, že věc, na kterou jsem měl plugin, &lt;a href="https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/pull/2978"&gt;dali přímo do jádra projektu&lt;/a&gt;. Super! Plugin &lt;a href="https://github.com/aklajnert/mkdocs-simple-hooks"&gt;mkdocs-simple-hooks&lt;/a&gt; jsem odinstaloval a přešel na nativní řešení.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V autobuse z Brna mě napadlo, že bych si mohl udělat skript, který přes RSS a youtube-dl stáhne díly jednoho video pořadu, kde jsou hlavně rozhovory a obraz tam není podstatný, vyseká jen zvuk a ten naservíruje přes podcastové RSS, které si přidám do &lt;a href="https://overcast.fm/"&gt;Overcastu&lt;/a&gt;. Díky tomu to budu moci poslouchat offline, v aplikaci, která mi vyhovuje a rychlostí, která mi vyhovuje (aktuálně 2,5x). Trvalo mi to trochu déle, než jsem chtěl, ale i tak jsem to měl hotové za pár hodin a sám se divím, ale funguje to. Akorát ty zvukové soubory hostuju na GitHub Pages a to asi není úplně ideální. A nejspíš to celé ani není legální, ale dělám to výhradně pro svou osobní potřebu, takže vám tu ani neřeknu, kde to celé je a co to je za pořad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Předal jsem člence klubu a shodou okolností teď i spoluorganizátorce pražského Pyva projekt Telegram bota, který lidem oznamuje, že bude Pyvo. Měl jsem ho &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/pyvo_bot"&gt;napsaný v Haskellu&lt;/a&gt; (viz &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/courting-haskell/"&gt;článek o Haskellu tady na blogu&lt;/a&gt;), neudržoval jsem ho a nedávno jsem ho dokonce vypnul. &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mia-bajic/"&gt;Mia&lt;/a&gt; ho chce přepsat do Pythonu v rámci &lt;a href="https://hacktoberfest.com/"&gt;Hacktoberfestu&lt;/a&gt;. Udělal jsem jí na to &lt;a href="https://github.com/pyvec/pyvo-bot"&gt;repo na Pyvci&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Byl jsem na &lt;a href="https://deepnote.com/"&gt;Deepnote&lt;/a&gt; párty a potkal jsem tam hodně zajímavých lidí, nových i „starých“. Netlačil jsem na pilu, takže z toho vyloženě nejsou nějaké &lt;em&gt;dealy&lt;/em&gt; s firmama, ale minimálně jsem si udělal některé důležité kontakty. Taky jsme tam nejspíš s kamarádkou upekli jeden z příštích dílů podcastu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dověděl jsem se, že existuje nějaká profesní síť &lt;a href="https://www.polywork.com/"&gt;Polywork&lt;/a&gt;, jakože „LinkedIn, ale lepší“. Zatím jsem neměl čas to vůbec prozkoumat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Napsala mi docentka z Ekonomické univerzity v Bratislavě, že chce používat materiály na junior.guru ve výuce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kamarád &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/muheuenga/"&gt;Muheue&lt;/a&gt;, pythonista z Namibie, pojede do Prahy na Ubuntu Summit a tak jsme řešili, jestli a jak se uvidíme.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vyrazili jsme se ženou na nákupy. Z lovu jsem si přinesl ponožky a bundu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Propagoval jsem nový díl podcastu: &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/podcast/"&gt;#8 Michal Matuška (SUPERKODERS) o leadershipu a juniorech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sháněl jsem přednášející do klubu a domlouval termíny. Rozjel jsem takhle asi pět konverzací. V klubu se začaly šířit memy o tom, jak špatně kdo sedí, tak jsem zkusil najít někoho, kdo rozumí ergonomii. Expert, kterého jsem oslovil, nemá bohužel kapacitu, ale třeba najdu někoho jiného.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uspořádali jsme v &lt;a href="https://www.kafeatrium.cz/"&gt;Atriu&lt;/a&gt; se ženou společnou narozeninovou oslavu pro pár přátel. Myslel jsem, že u lidí, kteří mají děti, se musí počítat s tím, že nepřijdou, protože se z hodiny na hodinu může stát cokoliv. Nakonec, i když to mělo být tak půl na půl, skoro všichni lidi s dětmi dorazili a skoro nikdo bez dětí nedorazil. Takže z toho byla odpolední školka párty, ale užili jsme si to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Namontoval jsem žárovky do koupelny.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Šel jsem na pivo s &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/liborvanekcz/"&gt;Liborem Vaňkem&lt;/a&gt; a kecali jsme o půlmaratonu a o JG.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Povedlo se mi na Facebook Marketu prodat monitor i se stojanem. Hurá! Několik hodin mi zabralo to celé připravit, natočit video že funguje, najít všechny šroubky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Potřebuji teď spát v místnosti, kde je celkem hluk a nemáme tam zatemňovací závěsy. Zjistil jsem, že se mi spí mnohem lépe, když si vezmu takovou tu škrabošku na oči z letadla a špunty do uší.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odpovídání v klubu, maily, a tak dále. Udělal jsem v klubu review jednoho celého juniorního projektu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 11 dní od 20.9. do 30.9. jsem naběhal 41 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 5 hodin a zdolal při tom 41 kilometrů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aktuální finanční výsledky, návštěvnost a další čísla k JG &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;mám přímo na webu&lt;/a&gt;. Nabídky práce pro juniory teď inzerují: &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/356c084cae33eaaffec2ab9c79fb583f7c1271f730acc612fa2dbfb8/"&gt;Credo Ventures&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/2b1ab731247b03b291bd7c4a0177e052df5ae4a5937144b4f2ce9d11/"&gt;Monitora media, s.r.o.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/dbbb7bf406b3c33aeba36cae817919d44bfb368a08fb1b4899dba130/"&gt;Processand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/34fa3ec07892dd3ff64458e2ccbf12578e00860483427e9e7c4847bc/"&gt;Red Hat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="co-planuji"&gt;Co plánuji&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#co-planuji" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tři věci, které bych chtěl zvládnout udělat příště:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Onboarding nových členů: Předělat mazání kanálů, doplnit další tipy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Propagovat &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/handbook/mental-health/"&gt;novou kapitolu v příručce&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://streetofcode.sk/podcast/juniorguru/"&gt;epizodu podcastu Street of Code&lt;/a&gt;, kde vystupuju.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vymyslet klubovou soutěž, ve které rozdám knihu &lt;a href="https://www.vzhurudolu.cz/css-layout/"&gt;CSS: moderní layout&lt;/a&gt; od Martina Michálka.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus:&lt;/strong&gt; Dát si klid od politiky a od akcí. Zavřít se doma v teplákách, pít čaj, programovat. Všeho teď bylo nějak moc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-co-vy"&gt;A co vy?&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#a-co-vy" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud byste čistě náhodou měli dojem, že jste oproti mě za uplynulý týden vůbec nic nestihli, tak mám pro vás skvělou zprávu! V klidu se na ten dojem &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/neni-to-zavod/"&gt;můžete vykašlat&lt;/a&gt;. Není zač!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="co-me-zaujalo"&gt;Co mě zaujalo&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#co-me-zaujalo" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když si něco přečtu nebo poslechnu a líbí se mi to, &lt;a href="https://getpocket.com/@honzajavorek"&gt;sdílím to na Pocketu&lt;/a&gt;. Od posledních poznámek jsem sdílel toto:&lt;/p&gt;

Literární reportáž z cyklu České bolesti&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Je to spíš rant jak z nějakého postu na FB, ale pár vět by se tam dalo tesat: „Snižte svou perspektivu do výše očí dětí a náhle přestanete přes hradby aut vidět. Svět zmizí a veškerý výhled zablokují kapoty. Ze světa se stane obludné místo. Něco jako Brno.“ Nebo: „Jsou to hlavně auta, všechna ta auta, co činí veřejný prostor českých měst a maloměst nepoužitelným. Veřejným se stává jen nárazově či omylem. Když se někde něco takzvaně koná. Pivní slavnosti, jarmark, předvolební či protestní setkání. Mě ale zajímá jiný veřejný prostor. Prostor, ve kterém chcete být, protože je příjemný, přestože se v něm vůbec nic neděje. Třeba chodník před domem.“&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Byli jsme u babičky a pořád pršelo, takže jsem měl spoustu času na práci a všechno, co jsem si minule vytyčil, se mi povedlo. Moc jsem se ani neúčastnil kampaně a pro klid duše moc nečetl ani sociální sítě, pokud šlo o politiku.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I když jsem se neubránil a na FB skupinu obce, kde babička bydlí, jsem vznesl dotaz ohledně křižovatky a přechodů, který v předvolební atmosféře nakonec vyústil v 50 komentářů :D Překvapivé pro mě bylo, že ač má v obci auto každý, většina komentujících chtěla zklidnit dopravu, víc přechodů, nebo dokonce cyklostezku napříč obcí. Reakce vedení byly zase převážně o tom, že rekonstrukce jedné ulice jsou miliony korun a ty obec nemá kde vzít, takže se musí hlásit na dotace a pokud žádné na tento typ investic vypsané nejsou, nebo je obec nedostane, nemohou nic dělat. Jsem laik, ale za mě: Něco dělat mohou (dočasná opatření, která moc nestojí a hotová jsou hned, viz pražské montované obrubníky nebo zelené balisety) a stav, kdy obec nemá na vlastní rozvoj, je tragický a jako hlavní příčinu vidím směšnou daň z nemovitosti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/340873144838343"&gt;Kozojedská desítka&lt;/a&gt; byla fajn a i když jsem měl skoro stejný čas jako před dvěma lety, mnohem lépe jsem si rozložil síly a v závodě jsem neumíral, ale užil jsem si ho. Překvapilo mě, že tempo jsem měl dost pomalé a sotva jsem se držel prošedivělého pana Leoše. Asi nemám naběháno moc kopců, takže mě ničily. To bych měl zlepšit. A taky bylo všude hodně bahna a já byl asi moc opatrný.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="penize"&gt;Peníze!&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#penize" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Všiml jsem si, že jsem dosáhl rodinného cíle a můj čistý měsíční příjem se &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1569640794931306497"&gt;poprvé vyšplhal na závratných 40.000 Kč&lt;/a&gt;. Jupí! Trvalo to jen tři roky od začátku podnikání. Z velké části mohu děkovat novému ceníku.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="adresy-a-presmerovani"&gt;Adresy a přesměrování&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#adresy-a-presmerovani" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ceník je stále v Google dokumentu, ale napadlo mě, že bych si pro něj mohl vytvořit nějakou hezčí adresu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Udělat redirect na webu, který nemá backend, znamená přečíst si &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/301-redirects"&gt;dokumentaci Googlu&lt;/a&gt; a využít starý dobrý meta refresh. Podle dokumentace je okamžitý meta refresh považován za permanentní redirect, ale pokud je tam prodleva, bere se jako dočasný. Já pro ceník vybral adresu &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/pricing"&gt;junior.guru/pricing&lt;/a&gt; a jednou bych tam třeba ceník mít opravdu chtěl, takže jsem tam chtěl dočasné přesměrování.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koukal jsem zase na &lt;a href="https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs-redirects"&gt;mkdocs-redirects&lt;/a&gt;, ale pak jsem si řekl, že přece stačí vytvořit jinou hlavní šablonu, dát do ní potřebné značky a použít ji pak v dokumentu pomocí &lt;code&gt;template&lt;/code&gt;. Tak jsem to i vyřešil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chvíli jsem zápasil s tím, že redirect by měl mít absolutní URL a to jsem v kódu zatím nikde nepotřeboval, ale udělal jsem si na to v jinja2 filtr &lt;code&gt;absolute_url&lt;/code&gt; a vyřešil to celkem rychle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když už jsem se patlal s redirecty, hecnul jsem se a zkusil přesunout jednu z prapůvodních stránek příručky do chlívku „handbook“, ve kterém bych je jednou chtěl všechny mít. Vybral jsem tu, která má nejmenší návštěvnost (a paradoxně největší důležitost pro úspěch juniora, lol), tedy &lt;code&gt;/practice/&lt;/code&gt; a přesunul jsem ji na &lt;code&gt;/handbook/practice/&lt;/code&gt;, opět pomocí redirectu s meta refresh, tentokrát ale permanentního. Uvidím, jakou škodu tím natropím, třeba v SEO, a poté začnu postupně opatrně přesunovat i další původní stránky, jako jsou &lt;code&gt;/motivation/&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/learn/&lt;/code&gt;, nebo &lt;code&gt;/candidate-handbook/&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pravidla-klubu"&gt;Pravidla klubu&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#pravidla-klubu" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chtěl jsem napsat další tip pro onboarding nových členů a vysvětlit v něm systém rolí v klubu. Jenže rolí už máme hodně a vysvětlení bylo strašně dlouhé a nepřehledné. Tak jsem se rozhodl udělat něco, co jsem na později stejně plánoval - překopat to, jak v klubu vypadají tzv. „pravidla“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na Discordu je hned několik míst, kam se dají pravidla dávat. Např. uvítací obrazovka, kterou jsem taky prošel a změnil, ale hlavně kanál, který admin označí, že v něm pravidla jsou a ten pak dostane speciální ikonku. Ve stávajících pravidlech jsem popisoval hodně věcí, které by teď měly vysvětlovat tipy pro nováčky. V plánu jsem tedy měl celý kanál změnit na něco, co bude spíš sloužit jako místo s permanentními infomacemi, které je dobré mít stále po ruce. Přejmenoval jsem ho na #nástěnka a místo ručně psané zprávy jsem nechal celý obsah kanálu spravovat bota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten tam dává a aktualizuje hned několik zpráv: základní tipy, seznam a popis rolí v klubu, seznam firem spolupracujících s klubem, seznam odkazů na záznamy klubových akcí a pak nějaké drobné info ze zákulisí klubu, např. odkaz na moje poslední týdenní poznámky, počet členů v klubu, odkaz na kód na GitHubu, na statistiky, atd. Vyrobení tohoto kanálu, se vším všudy, mi zabralo většinu týdne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snažil jsem se, aby tam byly fakt jen věci, které je dobré mít při ruce a lidé budou vědět, kde je najdou, když je budou hledat. Málokdo chodí z Discordu na web a zpět, takže dát takové věci jen na web není vždy řešení. Mít vše v nějakých opakujících se zprávách nebo připnutých příspěvcích, které nikdo nikdy neobjeví, také není ideální. Pro každou informaci se ale hodí trochu jiná forma, takže jsem rád, že teď mám v klubu forem hned několik (kanál s oznámeními, nástěnka, opakující se zprávy, tipy pro nováčky, web…) a mohu vždy vybrat tu ideální pro daný případ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Při vytváření nástěnky jsem zjistil, že Discord umožňuje mít v tzv. embedech u jedné zprávy v součtu pouze 6000 znaků, takže jsem nakonec musel jednotlivé sekce nástěnky rozsekat do více zpráv.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nefunkcni-suppress"&gt;Nefunkční suppress&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#nefunkcni-suppress" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S jásotem jsem sice objevil parametr &lt;code&gt;suppress&lt;/code&gt; při posílání a editaci zpráv, který zabrání načtení obrázků pro URL vložené ve zprávě, ale pak mi záhy spadlo CI a z chyby bylo patrné, že při posílání zpráv ten parametr neexistuje. To bylo podezřelé, ale na GitHubu pycordu &lt;a href="https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord/pull/1587#issuecomment-1245961350"&gt;mi vysvětlili&lt;/a&gt;, že tahle pár dní stará funkce ještě není ani v nejnovější verzi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protože u editace to funguje, pokrčil jsem rameny a přidal v kódu druhý řádek, který po odeslání zprávy tutéž zprávu hned edituje a obrázky potlačí. Třeba to jednou půjde najednou. Na to, jaká je to blbost, už jsem s tímhle strávil fakt hodně času. Je to fascinující :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oslovovani-firem"&gt;Oslovování firem&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#oslovovani-firem" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jak jsem měl v plánu, oslovil jsem všechny firmy, kterým má končit spolupráce s klubem. Některé už se ozvaly, že chtějí pokračovat, některé se ozvaly, že pokračovat neplánují. Jsem zvědav, jak to celé dopadne!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Někde jsem doháněl staré resty, třeba u aktualizace &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/dbbb7bf406b3c33aeba36cae817919d44bfb368a08fb1b4899dba130/"&gt;inzerátu pro Processand&lt;/a&gt;, kde jsme chtěli upravit pár vět. U jedné firmy jsem se připomenul s tím, že stále nedodali svůj inzerát, ale ujistili mě, že mám být v klidu, vědí o tom a jakmile budou mít vymyšlenou strategii, uděláme, co bude potřeba. A že se jim líbí co dělám a rádi JG podporují.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="domlouvani-prednasek"&gt;Domlouvání přednášek&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#domlouvani-prednasek" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ozval jsem se pár lidem s tím, zda by neměli chuť udělat pro klub přednášku. U jednoho člověka jsem si dokonce všiml, že jsme ji měli i naplánovanou, a to na 20.9. Což jsme oba úplně zazdili, škoda. Přeplánujeme, doladíme. Každopádně se snažím opět přednášky nějak rozjet a je to na dobré cestě.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pozvali mě na jednu startupovou party a asi tam půjdu. Pozvánka byla vyrobená přes něco, co se jmenuje &lt;a href="https://lu.ma/"&gt;lu.ma&lt;/a&gt;. Protože mě překvapilo, jak příjemně se na party registrovalo, využil jsem to hned při organizaci vlastních narozenin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opět chtěl někdo platit jinak než kartou a posílal jsem odpověď, že to nejde. Musím to už dát aspoň do &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/faq/"&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, ať to nevymýšlím pokaždé znova a mohu jen poslat odkaz. Je to jediná věc, která je opravdu častý dotaz a nemám ji v častých dotazech :D&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Občas spadlo CI kvůli nějaké prapodivné chybě při stahování nabídek práce. Zřejmě to trvalo moc dlouho, nebo to možná jen dlouho nic nepsalo do konzole, jelikož jsem měl v logu hodně debug výpisů a málo info výpisů, ale na CI je zapnuté jen info. Trochu jsem to poladil a uvidím, co se bude dít.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zásadní zjištění co se týče jednoho fakt otravného bugu na Discordu! V některých zprávách se začal projevovat bug s cachováním u Discord klientů, který už znám, ale myslel jsem, že v textu zpráv se neprojevuje. Našel jsem toto &lt;a href="https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/issues/2126"&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; a tam je vysvětlené, že se to může stát u kterékoliv mention, i v textu, pokud není notifikující. To vysvětluje ono podivné chování. Zároveň je to &lt;em&gt;wontfix&lt;/em&gt;, takže to Discord ani nehodlá opravit. Zajímavé.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na sociální sítě jsem pomáhal Engetu sdílet &lt;a href="https://engeto.cz/spoluprace/?utm_source=ext-jg"&gt;výzvu, aby k nim lidi šli lektorovat&lt;/a&gt;. Pokud bych jim pomohl někoho opravdu sehnat, možná mi za to pošlou nějaké peníze. Zkusil jsem na to využít všechny FB skupiny na pracovní nabídky v IT, o kterých jsem se v poslední době dověděl.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jeden večer jsem se zamýšlel nad tím, co se sociálními sítěmi do budoucna. Pročítal jsem si &lt;a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&amp;amp;q=+Marke%C5%A5%C3%A1k%C5%AFv+pr%C5%AFvodce+po+soci%C3%A1ln%C3%ADch+s%C3%ADt%C3%ADch+site%3Amediaguru.cz&amp;amp;ia=web"&gt;Markeťákův průvodce po sociálních sítích&lt;/a&gt;, abych měl lepší představu o tom, co od které sítě čekat a nezakládal to jen na svých předsudcích, nebo své bublině. Chtěl bych se časem hlavně rozhodnout, které sítě vynechám a vůbec na nich nebudu, protože to dává nejmenší smysl. Závěry zatím nemám.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pája natočila &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/podcast/"&gt;nový díl podcastu&lt;/a&gt; a bot o tom napsal do klubu. Akorát když se na to hned klikne, člověk díl nevidí, jelikož bot ještě nedokončil svou práci a nepublikoval novou verzi webu s novou epizodou. Opravil jsem to zatím jen tím, že jsem změnil texty u zprávy, kterou bot posílá a napsal tam, že díl se objeví „do půl hodiny“.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discord konečně umožnil běžným smrtelníkům používat tzv. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4MxuHNIIg0"&gt;fóra&lt;/a&gt;, speciální kanály, kde se dají zakládat vlákna jako ve fóru a se spoustou dalších užitečných funkcí. Přesně to se nám bude hodit na poradnu, ale zatím jsme to jen s Danem zkoumali a zjišťovali, jak přesně to funguje. Než to v klubu zapnu, budu muset naučit bota jak s tím pracovat a vymyslet, jaký tam bude panovat režim.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Věnoval jsem se klubu, mailům, a tak dále. Vyřešil jsem dvě stipendia. U jednoho jsem se doptal na informace a nedostal odpověď. Jedno jsem udělil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 7 dní od 13.9. do 19.9. jsem naběhal 28 km, při procházkách nachodil 3 km, ujel na kole 19 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 8 hodin a zdolal při tom 50 kilometrů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aktuální finanční výsledky, návštěvnost a další čísla k JG &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;mám přímo na webu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tři věci, které bych chtěl zvládnout udělat příště:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pracovat dál na onboardingu nových členů do klubu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plánovat přednášky v klubu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kampaň, párty, pivo s kamarádem, narozeniny…&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Byl to trochu blázinec. Předtím covid, teď jsme zase odjeli do Zlína k babičce, takže co bylo potřeba v Praze zařídit, to se natěsnalo do toho minulého týdne:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V pondělí jsem šel natáčet podcast &lt;a href="https://restarty.dev/"&gt;(re)štarty v IT&lt;/a&gt;, pak jsme s Alicí dali oběd, pak jsem šel k holičce, pak jsem měl pokec u kafe s Šárkou z WebExpa.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ve středu jsem se věnoval klubu a sdílel jsem &lt;a href="https://bit.ly/3QwBMvu"&gt;dotazník&lt;/a&gt;, který jsme spustili spolu s Ataccamou, abychom věděli, jak by měl ideálně vypadat event pro juniory, který se chystáme uspořádat. Pak jsem pracoval na letáčku pro Red Hat, ve čtyři odpoledne jsem natáčel podcast &lt;a href="https://streetofcode.sk/"&gt;Street of Code&lt;/a&gt; a potom jsem běžel na Jiřího z Poděbrad na stánek Zelených, pomoct s kampaní. Moc jsem toho ale už nestihl, stánek se spíš už balil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ve čtvrtek jsem se zúčastnil &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jeannetrojan_community-facetoface-people-activity-6973594677732098049-acIF?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=member_desktop"&gt;eventu organizovaného Jeanne Trojan&lt;/a&gt;. Diskutovali jsme práci z domů, hybridní práci, full remote, apod. Potom jsme šli s děckem na vítání občánků na radnici. Bylo z toho hned několik vtipných momentů. Jeden jsem &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1567909426186670081"&gt;rozmázl na Twitteru&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kampan"&gt;Kampaň!&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#kampan" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V pátek jsem se opět přihlásil na stánek &lt;a href="https://praha3.zeleni.cz/"&gt;Zelených&lt;/a&gt; a večer bylo na Jiřáku vinobraní, takže jsme šli zase tam. Tentokrát jsem tam byl několik hodin a odcházeli jsme až za tmy. Rozdal jsem nějaké ty Zelené noviny a promlouval s lidmi. Máme tam vždycky položenou velkou mapu Prahy 3 a u toho puntíky co se povedlo, co je v procesu, a co plánujeme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protože sleduju dění na Praze 3, dokázal jsem se spoustou lidí vést konverzaci o tom, co se kde plánuje, poradit jim, že existuje aplikace &lt;a href="https://www.cistatrojka.cz/"&gt;Čistá Trojka&lt;/a&gt;, nebo že mají svůj dům přidat do &lt;a href="https://www.praha3.cz/projekty/antigraffiti-program"&gt;antigrafitti programu&lt;/a&gt;. Hned několik lidí mi řeklo, že nás bude určitě volit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jsem rád, že moje osobní kampaň postoupila do další úrovně a po desítkách lidí v mém okolí, které jsem přesvědčil a volili by mě, ale nebydlí na Praze 3, se mi konečně povedlo mluvit i s lidmi, kteří tu bydlí :D Ale taky se mi teda povedlo dlouze mluvit s lidmi, kteří jen přišli na vinobraní a na Praze 3 nebydlí :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="coreskill"&gt;CoreSkill&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#coreskill" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V pátek před týdnem jsem se sešel naživo s &lt;a href="https://coreskill.tech/"&gt;Danem&lt;/a&gt;. Měli jsme čas pokecat o práci, ale i o úplně nesouvisejících věcech. Bavili jsme se o Danově marketingu (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/coreskilltech/status/1567421934404501505"&gt;hledá nové klienty&lt;/a&gt;, tak kdo chcete umět frontend, šup za ním!) a myslím, že jsem mu poradil něco, co se mu líbilo. Co se týče JG, řešili jsme zase tipy pro nové členy a vymýšleli, jak by to mohlo ideálně fungovat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vzájemně jsme se, věřím, nabili trochou energie a přátelstvím. S Danem máme symbiózu, kdy CoreSkill využívá klub jako platformu pro učení a Dan mi tam pomáhá moderovat a radí lidem. Aby to dobře fungovalo, nemůžeme spolu trávit čas jen řešením provozních věcí. Je potřeba se někdy i jen tak sejít, bez agendy, a pokecat o životě, sladit vlny. Bylo to fajn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="letacek"&gt;Letáček&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#letacek" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Z Red Hatu mě poprosili, zda bych pro &lt;a href="https://research.redhat.com/red-hat-research-day-europe-2022/"&gt;Red Hat Research Day 2022&lt;/a&gt; nedodal letáček, kde bude něco o JG. Stačilo PDF, oni by pořešili zbytek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vzpomněl jsem si, že hodně lidí tyto věci dělá v &lt;a href="https://canva.com/"&gt;Canvě&lt;/a&gt; a že i lidé, kteří maji minimum DTP znalostí, z toho dokážou vyprodukovat obstojné věci. Poprvé jsem se s tím setkal, když v tom myslím &lt;a href="https://dariagrudzien.com/"&gt;Daria&lt;/a&gt; kreslila logo pro &lt;a href="https://cybermagnolia.com/"&gt;CyberMagnolia&lt;/a&gt;. Pak s tím vždy přišel někdo další, naposledy jsem si všiml, že je v tom grafika pro účely kampaně Zelených na Praze 3. Takže jsem to chtěl už delší dobu vyzkoušet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O víkendu jsem spojil příjemné s užitečným a udělal jeden domácí úkol. Během prvního roku života jsme každý měsíc vyfotili naše dítě s jedním a tím samým plyšákem, aby šlo vidět, jak roste. Teď bylo potřeba to poskládat do nějaké koláže. Zkusil jsem Canvu a bylo to za hodinku hotové. Bylo tedy jasné, že letáček vyrobím v tom a taky se tak během týdne stalo. Výsledek &lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAFLjAmrIxw/-7N1cgk5s8-L9cbV-r1vLQ/view?utm_content=DAFLjAmrIxw&amp;amp;utm_campaign=designshare&amp;amp;utm_medium=link2&amp;amp;utm_source=sharebutton"&gt;tady&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celkově mi práce v Canvě přišla hodně podobná práci v Keynote, kterýžto už dlouho zneužívám na všechno možné, včetně přípravy podkladů pro tisk samolepek. Fajn je, že Canva umožňuje spolupráci více lidí a má hodně šablon a přednastavených nesmyslů. Fajn není, že když Canva zmizí z povrchu zemského, nemám na disku žádný zdrojový soubor pro svůj výrobek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vylepsovani-zasilani-tipu-novym-clenum-v-klubu"&gt;Vylepšování zasílání tipů novým členům v klubu&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#vylepsovani-zasilani-tipu-novym-clenum-v-klubu" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minulé poznámky skončily smutnou příhodou o tom, jak jsem se zasekl o limity Discordu. Ty jsem zatím překročil vytvářením několika kategorií se stejným názvem a dál to neřešil. Plánuju kanály postupně mazat, ale zatím to bot neumí.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zjistil jsem, že Discord &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/60764755/325365"&gt;má způsob&lt;/a&gt;, jak poslat botem zprávu, ve které jsou mentions, a přitom jimi nezpůsobit notifikaci. Což je super. Mnoho tipů pro nováčky v sobě má mentions, ať už přímo na mě, na moderátory i na jiné role. Implementoval jsem to a je to mnohem lepší, když mi nechodí při každém takovém tipu notifikace. Udělal jsem to tak, aby k notifikaci vedly mentions jen onoho nováčka, pro kterého kanál s tipy vznikl. Pokud tedy první tip začíná „Ahoj @franta“, tak taková notifikace přijde, ale jiné ne. Nastavení platí jen pro zprávy poslané botem, takže když mi dá mention člověk, tak mi to přijde.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optimalizoval jsem, jak se ukládají emoji reakce do databáze. Původně se jen spočítaly pozitivní a negativní reakce a ke zprávám se uložil počet. Pak se speciálně řešily špendlíky (viz dále). Z různých důvodů se mi hodí, abych v databázi měl přehled o všech typech reakcí. Myslel jsem, že je prostě stáhnu a uložím, ale informace o tom, přesně od koho je které emoji, vyžaduje mnoho API callů a trvalo to věčně. Tak jsem zůstal u toho, že ukládám akorát celkové počty těch emoji a konkrétní lidi se řeší jen u špendlíků.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V souvislosti s tím jsem přepracoval špendlíky. Jde o funkci, která v klubu je od pradávna. Když někdo dal ke zprávě v klubu emoji špendlíku, bot mu ji „uložil“ do soukromých zpráv. Původně to fungovalo tak, že když bylo lidí se špendlíkem hodně, zpráva se připíchla v kanálu pro všechny přímo použitím funkce &lt;em&gt;pin&lt;/em&gt; na Discordu. Počet lidí, jejichž špendlík je ke globálnímu připnutí potřeba, se počítal jako nějaké procento z celkového počtu členů v klubu. Tento aspekt se ale prakticky nevyužíval, připínajících nikdy nebylo dost a &lt;em&gt;pin&lt;/em&gt; na Discordu stejně není něco, co by lidi zas tak moc využívali. Takže jsem celou tuhle věc odstranil. Dokonce jsem to ani nikde neoznamoval, protože myslím, že to nikomu fakt chybět nebude. Špendlíky stále fungují, ale pouze ukládají do soukromých zpráv. Text o připínání pro všechny zmizel a kód, který to obsluhoval, taky, což je pro bota drobná úleva. Celé špendlíky jedou teď skoro 6 minut a potřebuji od základu předělat, jak ten kód funguje, ale na to nemám zrovna teď čas, takže aspoň taková drobná úleva. Opravil jsem při tom ve špendlíkách pár chybek v textech, odkazech na místnosti, na lidi, a tak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celou srandu s evidencí emoji reakcí jsem dělal hlavně proto, že nás s Danem napadlo, že lidi si budou muset kliknout, aby dostali další tip. Něco ve smyslu „pokud máš tento tip přečtený a chceš další, použij reakci zaškrtávátka pod zprávou a zítra dostaneš další“. Je to mazané, protože díky tomu vidíme, jestli to lidi čtou a je to nějaká drobná interakce, která lidi do klubu trochu vtahuje. Taky se neposílají zprávy těm, kdo o ně nestojí. Ať už proto, že do klubu jen nakoukli a zase odešli, nebo proto, že by je čtení tipů nebavilo. Kdo vše odškrtá, může nakonec za odměnu dostat i nějakou roli. To by předtím nešlo, protože takovou roli by dostal po nějakém čase každý, ať už by tipy četl, nebo ne. Z tohoto plánu se mi povedlo implementovat odškrtávání, roli žádnou zatím nemám. Ostatně nemám ani dopsány tipy, jsou tam zatím asi jen čtyři nebo kolik.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když jsem měl naimplementované zaškrtávání, uvědomil jsem si, že teď nepřijde žádný tip dosavadním nováčkům, protože něměli co zaškrtnout, ale bot nově zaškrtnutí vyžaduje. Naštěstí je zaškrtávání líně implementováno tak, že se neřeší, kdo konkrétně to zaškrtl, ale jen zda je zaškrtnuto. Hlídat kdo to zaškrtl mi přišlo jako overkill, protože v kanálu s tipy je jen nováček a my dva s Danem. Ale teď se tato nedokonalost hodila. Místo, abych musel dosavadní nováčky nějak speciálně řešit, prostě jsem prošel ručně jejich kanály a ty zaškrtávátka jim odklikal :D Další už si podle instrukcí odklikají sami.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S jedním členem jsme se o tipech hezky zakecali a přivedl mě na to, že bych měl delší tipy dělit do víc odstavců s nadpisy. Hned jsem existující tipy trochu přepsal a vylepšil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sdilena-kola"&gt;Sdílená kola&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#sdilena-kola" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Během týdne jsem měl několik pochůzek ve větší vzdálenosti, kde nebylo tak dobré spojení MHD a nechtělo se mi to celé jít na Žižkov pěšky, i když většinou pěšky chodím rád. Karlín, náměstí Míru, a tak. Tak jsem vyzkoušel &lt;a href="https://pid.cz/prakticke-informace/sdilenakola/"&gt;sdílená kola v rámci Lítačky&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Po prvním blbém zážitku s UX u Rekol jsem jim dal zase šanci. Otevřel jsem appku a objevila se čára kam mám jít a že nejbližší kolo je 5min ode mě. Tak jsem tam 5min šel. Na místě se koukám, že tam žádné kolo není. Dívám se znova do aplikace a tam vidím, že mě to neposlalo k nejbližšímu kolu, ale k nejbližšímu stojanu a nejbližší kolo je ve skutečnosti úplně jinde. Poslalo mě to ale do místa, kde byl zaparkovaný NextBike, takže jsem aplikaci zavřel, otevřel NextBike a za chvíli jsem byl doma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potom jsem NextBike použil ještě dvakrát a vždy to bylo jednoduché, pohodlné a většinou jsem v blízkosti narazil na nějaké kolo. Půjčení nebo vrácení kola je okamžité. Aplikaci na Rekola si v telefonu pro jistotu nechám, ale po tolika UX failech a po několikáté dobré zkušenosti s NextBikem budu mít asi problém ji otevřít jako první, když se mi zrovna bude hodit kolo. Mají ale lepší košík, z toho NextBikového gumového mi napoprvé málem vypadl noťas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sdílená kola jsem doteď vůbec nevyužíval. Zlomil to až ten tarif na Lítačku a musím říct, že je to super. Základem je mít v mobilu připravené ty aplikace k použití a mít tam aplikovanou tu Lítačku, jinak se k tomu nikdy nedokopete. Když si obě nachystáte, že s nimi stačí akorát vyrazit, pak už jen stačí vyskytnout se v situaci, kdy vás čeká delší pěší přesun a říct si - hele a není poblíž nějaké kolo? A šup, mrk do mapy a když je štěstí, za rohem nějaké kolo je a člověk je v destinaci mnohem rychleji. Překvapilo mě, že i docela dlouhé pěší trasy jsem bez větší námahy s kolem překonal za jednotky minut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Možná ze mě nakonec ještě bude ten militantní městský cyklista, a ne pouze militantní chodec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V průběhu týdne jsem se věnoval klubu, vítal lidi, odpovídal, dělal review CVčka, koukal na projekty členů klubu, pozval do klubu &lt;a href="https://blog.zvestov.cz/"&gt;Luboše&lt;/a&gt;, ukecával ho na přednášku o Javě, vyřídil hromady mailů, posunul dál jedno stipendium, a tak dále.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Konečně jsem přišel na to, jak poslat na Discord zprávu tak, aby se nezobrazil náhled vloženého URL. Není to ani &lt;code&gt;embed=None&lt;/code&gt;, ani &lt;code&gt;embeds=[]&lt;/code&gt;, ale je to &lt;code&gt;suppress=True&lt;/code&gt;. Ty dvě předchozí varianty mi s pycordem dřív fungovaly, o třetí jsem doteď nevěděl. Tak snad na desátý pokus už bude tahle věc fungovat správně.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Začaly mi sem tam padat nějaké věci okolo stahování nabídek práce. Zatím jsem přidal logování, opravil jednu drobnou chybu s kódováním textu a parsováním HTML a uvidím, kdy se zase nějaká chyba objeví. Snad potom budu mít díky tomu logování víc informací a najdu příčinu problémů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Narazil jsem na web s &lt;a href="https://european-alternatives.eu/"&gt;evropskými alternativami amerických služeb&lt;/a&gt;. Škoda, že když cokoliv z toho použiju a zaplatím za to ze svého podnikatelského účtu, tak mi to zkomplikuje daně. Jsem OSVČ, nejsem plátce DPH a kvůli zbytečné byrokracii nechci být ani identifikovaná osoba, dokud to bude možné. Za tyto služby se platí v řádu stokorun a kvůli tomu se zvýšit byrokracii v minimalistickém podnikání opravdu nevyplatí. Když nakoupím služby u firem z USA, nic z toho řešit nemusím. Ach jo, Evropo!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odstranil jsem workaround z nastavení instalace JG pomocí Poetry. Řešil &lt;a href="https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/3336"&gt;toto issue&lt;/a&gt;, ale to už zavřeli, tak zkouším, jestli to bude OK. Musel jsem ovšem zajistit, abych měl všude co nejnovější verzi Poetry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opravil jsem kapající kohoutek v kuchyni. Rozebral jsem baterii, našel prasklé těsnění, obul jsem si boty, zašel pěšky pro těsnění do instalatérských potřeb kousek od našeho domu, vrátil se a dodělal to. &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/bez-auta/"&gt;Město krátkých vzdáleností!&lt;/a&gt; Mám to tady fakt rád.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 10 dní od 3.9. do 12.9. jsem naběhal 8 km, při procházkách nachodil 5 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 4 hodin a zdolal při tom 13 kilometrů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aktuální finanční výsledky, návštěvnost a další čísla k JG &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;mám přímo na webu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Čtyři věci, které bych chtěl zvládnout udělat příště:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pracovat dál na onboardingu nových členů do klubu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Běhat, abych uběhl &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/340873144838343"&gt;Kozojedskou desítku&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ozvat se firmám, které mají prodloužit členství.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plánovat přednášky v klubu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-co-vy"&gt;A co vy?&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#a-co-vy" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jednou ročně jezdím se dvěma kamarády na víkendovou cykloexpedici. Předloni nám to docela propršelo a vloni to nevyšlo, částečně kvůli tomu, že jsme měli mimino. Letos se to tedy mělo konat po dvou letech a moc jsem se na to těšil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V den odjezdu jsem ráno zaznamenal, že mi není úplně dobře. Pozoroval jsem to, ale nechal jsem tomu volný průběh, protože jsem nechtěl celou akci rušit kvůli bolení hlavy, když jsem se na to tak těšil. Odšlapal jsem pak 128 km na paralenech a během toho nakazil několik lidí covidem. Nejsem na to vůbec hrdý a v mnoha ohledech je to do budoucna velké poučení. K tomu všemu nám to zase propršelo, ještě víc než minule. Poslední den jsme museli úplně zrušit a odjet vlakem domů.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covid jsem si nejspíš odnesl z &lt;a href="https://pyvo.cz/praha-pyvo/"&gt;Pyva&lt;/a&gt; několik dní předtím, ale důkazy pro to žádné nemám. Doma jsme lehli celá rodina, včetně děcka. Za normálních okolností bychom to prostě prospali jako chřipku, ale nemít sílu a muset se u toho starat o malé děcko, které je samo taky nemocné a brečí celý den, to nebylo vůbec nic příjemného a přivedlo mě to na pokraj zhroucení nejen fyzického, ale i psychického. Teď už je covid naštěstí pryč a začínáme se vracet do normálního života.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dohaneni-zameskaneho"&gt;Dohánění zameškaného&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dohaneni-zameskaneho" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jako první jsem procházel klub, maily, a tak dále. Covid volně navázal na mou krátkou dovolenou (tedy spíš „dovolenou“) a během covidu jsem taky neměl sílu číst moc věcí, takže se všeho nahromadilo milion a četl jsem to pak dva dny. Zase jsem to využil k tomu, abych odpověděl na dlouho odkládané maily tetám a vzdáleným strejdům.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V klubu jsem mrknul na jedno CVčko, uvítal všechny nové lidi, podíval jsem se na jedno stipendium. U stipendia jsem oznámil Mews, že už mi nebudou proplácet členství v klubu pro ty, kdo stipendium dostanou. V novém režimu ceníku už to nedává moc smysl takto řešit. Budu to prostě udělovat já a oni ať proplácí jen ty věci navíc, které k tomu případně přidáme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reagoval jsem na mail ohledně partnerství s &lt;a href="https://ajtyvit.sk/"&gt;ajtyvit.sk&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://www.profesia.sk/"&gt;profesia.sk&lt;/a&gt;, které pomaličku pečeme. Odpověděl jsem jedné firmě na poptávku po výkonnosti &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/"&gt;junior.guru/jobs&lt;/a&gt;. Poslal jsem jim veřejné statistiky a nějak jsem to okecal. Zatím bez odpovědí.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="prokrastinace"&gt;Prokrastinace&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#prokrastinace" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prioritně jsem měl pracovat na dokončení onboardingu, ale to by bylo příliš zodpovědné, takže jsem se pustil do jiných věcí. Nejdřív jsem opravil chybu v botovi na Discordu, který neuměl při vítání nových členů v kanálu #ahoj přeskakovat starší a už archivovaná vlákna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pak jsem se podíval na svou knihovnu &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/czech-holidays"&gt;czech-holidays&lt;/a&gt;. Nějaký borec z KPMG mi napsal mail, že mám v knihovně chybu a mě se zrovna chtělo prokrastinovat, tak jsem to nejen opravil, ale celou knihovnu jsem i oživil a předělal. Víc jsem o tom napsal do &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1564907198832152576"&gt;vlákna na Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. Na své nové řešení jsem byl hrdý do chvíle, než bráchu napadlo, že by knihovna &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/czech-holidays/issues/14"&gt;mohla umět ještě i otvírací doby&lt;/a&gt;. U toho jsem si uvědomil, že kdybych je přidal, byla by to asi breaking change, jelikož teď knihovna vrací tuples a ty nejsou jednoduše rozšiřitelné :D Každopádně bych stejně nechtěl přidávat něco jen tak, u čeho nemám ověřeno, že by to doopravdy použili aspoň tři lidi, takže jsem jen založil issue a počkám, jaký bude zájem. Já si nejsem vůbec jistý, jestli celé czech-holidays vůbec používají aspoň tři lidi ¯\_(ツ)_/¯&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pak už nezbývalo než prokrastinovat pomocí upgradů. Knihovna ics konečně &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/ics/0.8.0.dev0"&gt;vydala novou verzi na PyPI&lt;/a&gt;. Dověděl jsem se o tom, protože jsem sledoval patřičná issues na GitHubu. I když je to pre-release, stále lepší, než instalovat z gitu, takže jsem na to hned upgradoval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Další věc byla py-cord, kde zavřeli &lt;a href="https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord/issues/1491"&gt;moje issue&lt;/a&gt;, s kterým jsem před několika týdny strávil moře času. Upgradoval jsem na nejnovější verzi a hurá, vše fungovalo. Radost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="spusteni-onboardingu"&gt;Spuštění onboardingu&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#spusteni-onboardingu" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pak jsem se zastavil a uvědomil si, že takhle ten onboarding nikdy nedodělám. Prostě to jen prokrastinuju. A protože už mám něco odžito, vím, že na to je dobrá jedna konkrétní léčba: &lt;em&gt;continuous delivery&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Já sice &lt;em&gt;continuous delivery&lt;/em&gt; dělat chtěl, vytvořil jsem MVP a stačilo napsat pět prvních tipů a ty pak pustit do prvních beta testerů, ale to psaní mi prostě takhle nešlo. Takže jsem se rozhodl, že když to nejde skrz &lt;em&gt;continuous delivery&lt;/em&gt;, půjde to skrz &lt;strong&gt;větší&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;continuous delivery&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dal jsem si úkol, že do konce dne to spustím. S tím jedním tipem, který mám napsaný. A prostě budu dopisovat další tipy a vždy, když nějaký dodám, tak se lidem pošle. A že mě to tak bude bavit víc, protože hned uvidím výsledek. A že ty tipy budou i lepší, protože při psaní dalších hned uvidím, jak lidi reagují na ty první.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Povedlo se a do konce dne jsem měl tipy spuštěné. A hned jsem přišel na několik chyb a opravil je. Oznámil jsem v klubu, že onboarding spouštím a že sice bot slibuje posílání tipů „zhruba jednou za den“, ale že to bude asi chodit pomaleji a možná i zmateněji, protože to teprve ladím. A hotovo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Čtvrtek jsem strávil psaním dalších tipů a úplně jsem se do toho ponořil. Najednou mě to hrozně bavilo, protože jsem věděl, že viditelný výsledek je jeden git push daleko. Akorát že jsem na konci dne ten git push udělal a celé to spadlo. Zjistil jsem, že Discord má nějaké limity na počet kanálů a tento fakt mi rozšlapal bábovičky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="co-s-tim"&gt;Co s tím?&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#co-s-tim" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Při onboardingu bot založí privátní kanál pro nového člověka, přidá do něj moderátory a posílá do něj postupně tipy. S těmito kanály jsem měl velké plány i do budoucna. Musí to být privátní kanály, protože:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do &lt;strong&gt;soukromých zpráv&lt;/strong&gt; by viděl jen bot, ne já nebo jiný moderátor. Bot může posílat soukromé zprávy, ale musel bych nějak ošetřit, aby mu tam lidi neodepisovali, nebo aby mi to přeposlal, nebo aby jim na to něco odepsal a poučil je, že jejich zprávu nikdo neuvidí.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taky by se mi dost špatně ladilo, co přesně komu bot do soukromých zpráv posílá.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Někteří uživatelé mají striktní nastavení a neumožňují doručování soukromých zpráv od účtů, které nemají v přátelích. Bot by, pokud by se mu soukromá zpráva nepovedla poslat, musel vytvořit něco přímo v klubu a poprosit uživatele, aby si jej přidal do přátel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soukromé zprávy jsou mimo Discord servery, pouze mezi uživateli. Proto v nich neexistuje kontext klubu a nelze tam dělat plnohodnotné odkazy na místnosti, lidi, nebo role v klubu. Na tipy to reálně použít prostě nejde.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na Discordu nově existuje koncept &lt;strong&gt;privátních vláken&lt;/strong&gt;, který by možná šel využít. Kdyby neměly jednu vlastnost, a to, že pokud tam je nějaký odkaz na někoho, automaticky ho to do vlákna přidá jako účastníka diskuze. Tedy kdybych poslal tip, ve kterém bych chtěl zmínit, že existuje nějaká role a označil ji tam, tak by se do vlákna přidali všichni, kdo tu roli mají. Na tipy to reálně použít prostě nejde.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Privátní vlákna by se po nějaké době neaktivity automaticky archivovala, což by mohlo být dobře nebo špatně.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Privátní vlákna by se tvářila jako privátní, ale ve skutečnosti, kdyby tam kdokoliv omylem někoho označil, např. „Honzo, tady ten uživatel @pepíček je na mě hnusný, pomož mi“, tak by to pepíčka přidalo do diskuze. To si nemusí při psaní člověk uvědomit a byla by to potenciálně nebezpečná díra do soukromí.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musí to tedy být &lt;strong&gt;privátní kanály&lt;/strong&gt;! Ty nemají žádné z uvedených nevýhod, ale Discord umožňuje mít v jedné kategorii pouze 50 kanálů a na Discord serveru pouze 500 kanálů celkem (včetně kategorií, které Discord bere jako kanály). Údajně je i limit na 1000 aktivních vláken, ale to je mi asi celkem jedno.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zatím jsem vymyslel jen to, že se tedy musím nějak spokojit se zhruba 400 privátními kanály, když 100 si nechám na zbytek klubu. V době psaní těchto poznámek má klub 370 členů, takže je jasné, že kanály nemohou zůstávat a budou podléhat nějaké retenci, to se nedá nic dělat. Jejich jediný účel bude onboarding uživatele a potom se smažou. Na velké plány do budoucna mohu zapomenout, nebo je prostě musím vyřešit jinak než privátním kanálem pro každého uživatele zvlášť. Pokud se budou kanály zavírat, limit na 400 by měl stačit, protože předpokládám, že nebudu nikdy onboardovat 400 uživatelů zároveň. Tipy se budou posílat dva až tři týdny, pak se kanál zavře. Měsíčně teď přijde klub vyzkoušet do 80 lidí, maximum v historii bylo kolem 100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jak vyřeším, že v jedné kategorii může být jen 50 kanálů? Vytvořím víc kategorií stejného jména. Lidem se zobrazí pouze jedna kategorie a jeden kanál, protože jen tam mohou vidět. Já bohužel uvidím 8 kategorií pro 400 kanálů, ale to je můj boj. Discord naštěstí podporuje to, že kategorie i kanály se mohou jmenovat totožně (liší se IDčkem).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jak si uložím, že někdo prošel onboardingem a už se může kanál smazat a nemá se znova vytvořit? Zatím mě napadlo jen poslat člověku do soukromé zprávy nějakou gratulaci, podle které to pak poznám. Pokud člověku nepůjde psát soukromé zprávy, vytvoří bot privátní vlákno v kanálu #klub a poprosí člověka, aby si přidal bota do přátel. Toto nemusím programovat hned. Obecně, permanentně platné věci budou muset být vidět někde v klubu, nebo se musí poslat do soukromých zpráv. Uvítací kanál se po nějaké době smaže.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Původně jsem počítal s tím, že když napíšu nový tip, přijde i lidem, kteří jsou v klubu už dlouho. To už nebude možné. Co s tím? Asi nic. Takový člověk bude muset holt sledovat novinky v klubu, číst si oznámení, vnímat změny. Onboarding bude sloužit jen zcela novým členům.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="aspon-hotfix-na-patecek"&gt;Aspoň hotfix na páteček&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#aspon-hotfix-na-patecek" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teď v pátek jsem do kódu nějak narychlo doplácal, aby se kanály vytvářely do více kategorií a aby mi všechno přestalo aspoň padat. Takže už se umí založit více jak 50 kanálů, aktuálně 61 ve dvou kategoriích. Objevil jsem u toho další chyby, např. že některé tipy měly přes 2000 znaků a to je zase na Discordu přes limit na příspěvek. To mi ale zase tolik nevadilo, aspoň to byla dobrá motivace texty zkrátit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V klubu jsem při oznámení spuštění onboardingu napsal, že kdo to chce ze starších členů vyzkoušet, ať dá na zprávu emoji s (pokusným) králíkem, že je přidám mezi beta testery. Jenže jak se tam stále klikali, přestalo mě bavit je přidávat ručně. Doprogramoval jsem tedy pár řádků, které se na tu zprávu podívají, přečtou kdo dal emoji králíka a tyto uživatele zařadí do onboardingu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mEInB4EOzyQkDbcs8BTEqDhtV-9IAIDPKirjmcH5jaA/edit#"&gt;Python sprint&lt;/a&gt; se konal a já tam nebyl, protože jsem doma ležel s covidem. Zjevně to ale lidi nakoplo. Možná bude komunita zase organizovat &lt;a href="https://cz.pycon.org/"&gt;PyCon CZ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advokátka &lt;a href="https://pyvec.org/"&gt;Pyvce&lt;/a&gt; se ozvala s tím, že soud díky novým papírům konečně úspěšně přijal výsledek našich voleb a máme zase všechno v pořádku a funkční nový výbor. Hned jsem ji poprosil, aby nám připravila nějaké věci do budoucna, které by nám umožnily se takovým situacím pro příště vyhnout. Na schůzi výboru jsem tentokrát nebyl kvůli covidu, ale prý do spolku přijali novou členku, což je super.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Měl jsem call s velkou firmou, která chtěla prodloužit spolupráci s klubem. Rozjížděl se mi už covid a tak jsem to absolvoval s paralenem. Přesto se mi podle nového ceníku podařilo prodat jim ten nejvyšší tarif. Už jsem dokonce poslal fakturu a mám z toho celého radost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;S jinou firmou jsme si o prodloužení spolupráce zatím jen psali. Upozornil jsem na nový ceník a čekám na odpověď.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na sociální sítě jsem zase nic nepsal, nebaví mě to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 14 dní od 20.8. do 2.9. jsem při procházkách nachodil 4 km a ujel na kole 128 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 17 hodin a zdolal při tom 132 kilometrů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aktuální finanční výsledky, návštěvnost a další čísla k JG &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;mám přímo na webu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Čtyři věci, které bych chtěl zvládnout udělat příště:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pracovat dál na onboardingu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Posunout vpřed věc, která souvisí se spoluprací s Ataccama.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Udělat za junior.guru letáček pro &lt;a href="https://research.redhat.com/red-hat-research-day-europe-2022/"&gt;Red Hat Research Day 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Být hostem ve dvou podcastech a účastnit se jednoho až dvou komunitních eventů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Měl jsem tentokrát hodně rozptylování, které omezilo mé možnosti soustředěně pracovat. V úterý jsem se jel dopoledne místo práce projet, abych o víkendové dovolené na kole nešel z nuly na sto. Odpoledne jsem se stavil do Karlína za panem &lt;a href="https://rozbiteprasatko.cz/"&gt;Rozbitým prasátkem&lt;/a&gt;, dali jsme kafe a na střídačku si povídali a pracovali. Ve středu jsme jeli k pediatrovi. Ve středu odpoledne přijel &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_tomehrlich"&gt;Tom&lt;/a&gt;, večer jsme strávili na &lt;a href="https://pyvo.cz/praha-pyvo/"&gt;Pyvu&lt;/a&gt;. Zkusili jsme jet se ženou oba a vzít i dítě. Dítě nám to pak spočítalo. Ve čtvrtek jsem šel klasicky pracovat do &lt;a href="https://atriumzizkov.cz/kavarna"&gt;Atria&lt;/a&gt; a chvíli si tam povídal s kamarádem o nějaké jeho krizi. Teď je pátek, píšu poznámky a večer se budu chystat na zítřejší odjezd na kolo. Vlastně se dost divím, že se mi tento týden povedlo udělat &lt;em&gt;vůbec něco&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pyvo bylo fajn, pokecal jsem s hodně lidma, ale trochu se bojím, že jsem, jako obvykle, hodně povídal a málo poslouchal. No nic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="novy-cenik-pro-firmy"&gt;Nový ceník pro firmy&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#novy-cenik-pro-firmy" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hlavním cílem týdne bylo navrhnout nový ceník pro firmy, který by měl být platný od září. Nebudu vás napínat, výsledek je &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CIKQKQ9eTpS8LmdxGqppOSim4gYOpoRcekqmPpnyLEI/"&gt;tady&lt;/a&gt; (starý je &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1keFyO5aavfaNfJkKlyYha4B-UbdnMja6AhprS_76E7c/"&gt;tady&lt;/a&gt;), dal jsem to už i na web s tím, že ladit to můžu ještě za pochodu. &lt;strong&gt;Budu fakt rád za feedback!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="zmeny-v-ceniku"&gt;Změny v ceníku&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#zmeny-v-ceniku" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Především jsem se snažil &lt;strong&gt;zdražit a dát tomu nějakou jasnější formu a pravidla&lt;/strong&gt;. Odstranil jsem co nejvíc věcí, které zahrnovaly mou přímou účast na spolupráci a pokud zahrnují, tak aby měly adekvátní cenovku, která pokryje režii. Zjednodušil jsem nabídku na tři sloupce a odstranil nabídku produktů, o které nikdo moc zájem nejevil. Přidal jsem nové věci, za které mohou firmy platit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Odstranil jsem kompletně &lt;strong&gt;nabídku pro vzdělávací agentury&lt;/strong&gt;. Snažím se zjednodušit svůj byznys a vzdělávací agentury pro mě nejsou vyloženě konkurence, ale je složité s nimi vymyslet něco, co dává smysl oběma stranám a neovlivňuje mou nezávislost (nedoporučuji kurzy, nikomu nenadržuji a nebaví mě zjednodušující marketing „IT je zlatý důl, hurá všichni do IT“). Produkt, kdy agentura posílá své studenty a absolventy do klubu, aby tam dostali kariérní rady, se nepovedlo prodat více firmám. Kvůli jedné jsem to původně vymyslel, ale nakonec to nechtěla. Jiná jej chce, ale produkt byl na realizaci složitější, než jsem myslel a možná by mi bylo do budoucna dobře i bez něj. Rozhodl jsem se nechat doběhnout existující spolupráce, ale jinak segment vzdělávacích agentur spíš opustit a soustředit se především na firmy, které:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mě chtějí podpořit (CSR),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;chtějí najímat lidi (hiring),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;chtějí budovat svou značku (employer branding).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Odstranil jsem &lt;strong&gt;vše kolem stipendia&lt;/strong&gt;, protože stipendium přidává režii a pokud na něm budu schopen někdy něco automatizovat, tak jen pokud bude pod mými křídly - tzn. vydělám prostě dost peněz na to, abych sám dokázal někomu dotovat vzdělávání. Bude to podle mě jednodušší, než hledat firmy, které by se chtěly podílet na spolúčasti a komunikovat s nimi. Aktuálně rozjetá partnerství chci v tomto směru zachovat, ale nebudu hledat nová.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novinkou je také to, že už &lt;strong&gt;neprodávám vstupy do klubu na jednotky&lt;/strong&gt;, ale dávám všem firmám jednotné množství, které by mělo všem stačit. Limit na počet členů v klubu a dokupování lidí nad limit nebyla ta hodnota, pro kterou by firmy chtěly nakoupit víc a není to ta hodnota, kterou chci prodávat. Upřímně mě to spíš otravovalo. Některé firmy to využily na maximum a přikupovaly, jiné poslaly do klubu dva lidi nebo dokonce nikoho. Přitom to neovlivňovalo, jak moc chtěly nakoupit dalších věcí.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="vypocet-cen"&gt;Výpočet cen&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#vypocet-cen" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ceny částečně vychází z ceny členství pro jednotlivce, z mých nákladů, z toho jestli určité výhody pro firmu znamenají, že se jim budu muset věnovat a jak moc. Celkově jsem se snažil, aby můj čas byl zaplacen co nejvíc. Taky se mi pocitově líbí, že tarif, který chci aby nakoupilo nejvíc firem, zhruba odpovídá tomu, kolik chci, aby JG za měsíc vydělávalo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ceny vyšších tarifů v hlavě srovnávám především s tím, jaké má běžně firma náklady na nábor nových lidí a stále mi přijde, že v tomto kontextu i teď nabízím něco dost levného. Zase jde o juniory, kde se firmy snaží spíš šetřit, takže hledám nějakou rovnováhu. Něchtěl bych být moc levný, ale nechci ceny zas nějak přepálit. Ještě je možná budu dolaďovat, než nový ceník v září oficiálně oznámím.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="zmena-skladby-klientu"&gt;Změna skladby klientů&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#zmena-skladby-klientu" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aktuálně spolupracuje klub s 18 firmami a loga se mi už skoro nevejdou na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/club/"&gt;klubovou stránku&lt;/a&gt;. Dostávám se tedy za fázi penetračních cen a ověřování, jestli je o mé služby vůbec zájem. Zdražuji i proto, že zájem je a je zbytečné, aby s klubem spolupracovalo 20 firem a každá zvlášť mi vytvářela režii. Menší firmy mě stále mohou podpořit nejlevnějším tarifem, ten ale nevyžaduje prakticky žádný můj čas. Firem, kterým se budu muset trochu už věnovat, zase nebude muset být díky vyšší ceně tolik.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nejvyšší tarif by měl být zcela exkluzivní, už jen proto, že na příručku nejde dát mnoho log (asi tak čtyři maximálně) a podcast si určitě nechceme zaplácat pouze firemními hosty (vychází měsíčně a měsíců je jen 12). Takže u nejvyššího tarifu počítám dokonce s tím, že kdyby hrozilo, že by o něj byl větší zájem, tak budu cenu dynamicky zvyšovat, aby o něj byl zájem menší, nebo napíšu, že je aktuálně vyprodaný :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rozhodně neplánuju mít takový ten VIP tarif, kde je „kontaktujte naše sales a domluvíme se, že můžete chtít cokoliv, když zaplatíte nekonečně mnoho“. Jednak nemám sales, jednak je takový tarif přesným opakem toho, co potřebuji, jelikož by mi vygeneroval neskutečné množství režie a sice by možná vydělal dost peněz, ale já bych svůj čas pak musel věnovat uspokojování velkých firem (např. organizací nějakých promo akcí nebo nevím) a komunikaci s firmami a ne práci na klubu a příručce, což chci ve skutečnosti dělat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="cenik-stale-jako-sdileny-dokument"&gt;Ceník stále jako sdílený dokument&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#cenik-stale-jako-sdileny-dokument" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ceník je stále pouze v Google Docs, jednak protože nemám čas na HTML, jednak protože ho mohu podle potřeby snadno upravovat. Zkusil jsem nový „pageless“ formát dokumentu, ale Docs o tomto formátu bohužel nepochopitelně říkají každému návštěvníkovi dokumentu, i když je to jen pro čtení, takže to je trochu fail, ale předělávat to teď už nebudu, možná později. Ceník je také stále velmi ukecaný a je tam spousta vysvětlujícího textu, ale to je zčásti i proto, že to není v HTML a měl by být i tak přehlednější, než ten starý ceník. Snad to takhle prostě bude &lt;em&gt;good enough&lt;/em&gt;. Do starého ceníku jsem nakonec dal ještě výrazný odkaz na nový ceník, kdyby měl někdo někde schované původní URL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sociální sítě jsem neřešil vůbec, dokonce mě nějak nebavilo ani dělat storíčka ze svého osobního života. Akorát jsem &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1558916335945515009"&gt;tweetl myšlenku o firmách a open source&lt;/a&gt;, kterou většina lidí spíš nepochopila, ale debata z toho byla, na Twitter poměry, hezká.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Klub, maily, a tak dále. V klubu bylo tentokrát potřeba i trochu moderovat a klidnit vášně.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 7 dní od 13.8. do 19.8. jsem ujel na kole 45 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 3 hodiny a zdolal při tom 45 kilometrů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aktuální finanční výsledky, návštěvnost a další čísla k JG &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;mám přímo na webu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tři věci, které bych chtěl zvládnout udělat příště:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dodělat první verzi zpráv pro onboarding a pustit je do první testovací skupiny lidí.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V pondělí si užít dovolenou na kole.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Možná jet na &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mEInB4EOzyQkDbcs8BTEqDhtV-9IAIDPKirjmcH5jaA/edit#"&gt;Python sprint&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tento týden byl ve znamení &lt;em&gt;yak shaving&lt;/em&gt; a mám z toho smíšené pocity. Sice jsem udělal spoustu zajímavé práce, která mě i bavila, ale zda to bylo důležité, to je dost pochybné a to nejdůležitější jsem neudělal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co přesně znamená &lt;em&gt;yak shaving&lt;/em&gt; si buď vyhledejte, nebo si pusťte &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fnfeuoh4s8"&gt;těchto nesmrtelných 42 sekund&lt;/a&gt; a pochopíte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Přes Žďár nad Sázavou jsem několikrát v životě jel, třeba na kole, ale nikdy jsem neviděl zámek, kostel, atd. A &lt;a href="https://www.mall.tv/gebrian-prekvapive-stavby/poutni-kostel-sv-jana-nepomuckeho-na-zelene-hore"&gt;že je na co koukat&lt;/a&gt;. Udělali jsme si tam prodloužený víkend s kamarády a bylo to fajn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Z Regiojetu tam a zpět jsem měl trochu smíšené pocity, ale o tom napíšu třeba někdy jindy. Ač jsem vyhejtil bídné sobotní MHD (&lt;a href="https://blog.tomashajzler.com/clanek/o-dalsi-ceste-bez-auta-aneb-tragedie-ceske-verejne-dopravy"&gt;po vzoru Hajzlera&lt;/a&gt;), nebo ulici u zámku, kde na několika kilometrech není přechod (a tam, kde asi byl nebo brzo bude, je vyloženě zákaz vstupu chodcům bez alternativy, jak se dostat na druhou stranu frekventované cesty), tak jinak je Žďár celkem pěkný a jde tam vidět snahu o zlepšování veřejného prostoru, což cením. Viděl jsem tam hezká nově upravená místa v centru, kolem zámku a kostela, dobrý je rekreační areál Pilák (připomnělo mi to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BitchfaceKam/status/1431330071965470723"&gt;Piláta&lt;/a&gt;), kde jsme na pískovišti strávili fakt hodně času.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Několikadenní dovolená s ročním děckem byla hodně o tom, jakou náladu mělo zrovna děcko a jestli chtělo usnout nebo ne, ale i tak jsme si to myslím užili. Žena má teď nohu v ortéze a kdyby byla pohyblivější, asi bychom si to užili víc, ale i tak se to dalo, cestování s kočárkem, batohama a berlema vlakem bylo nakonec jednodušší, než to původně znělo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Povedla se nám zlomit nějaká tenká tyčka na kočáru, asi proto, že jsme ho po roce poprvé nějak víc skládali a rozkládali a neuměli jsme to ve spěchu udělat správně (&lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/bez-auta/"&gt;nemáme auto&lt;/a&gt;, tak kočár skládat v 99 % nepotřebujeme). Výrobce (X-Lander) hned napsal, že nám to opraví, což je fajn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="psani-tipu-na-onboarding"&gt;Psaní tipů na onboarding&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#psani-tipu-na-onboarding" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Největší prioritou týdne bylo dopsat tipy na onboarding nových členů. Jenže jsem asi neměl vůbec chuť něco psát a měl jsem strašnou chuť ponořit se do programování, takže jsem nenapsal ani písmenko, zato jsem naprogramoval spoustu nedůležitých věcí. Následuje vše, co jsem udělal místo tipů, rozděleno do dvou kategorií: Jednak prokrastinace, jednak finalizace nové stránky o psychickém zdraví během cesty do IT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="prokrastinace"&gt;Prokrastinace&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#prokrastinace" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uklízel jsem si taby v prohlížeči. Myslím, že teď jich mám místo 200 už jen tak 20.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Koukal jsem na &lt;a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/pyright"&gt;pyright&lt;/a&gt; a pak jsem zjistil, že už ho dávno používám, protože je zabudovaný přímo ve VS Code ¯\_(ツ)_/¯&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pročítal jsem si &lt;a href="https://newcreatormanifesto.com/"&gt;newcreatormanifesto.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opravoval jsem rozbitý build u kódu webů &lt;a href="https://github.com/pyvec/pyvec.org"&gt;pyvec.org&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://github.com/pyvec/python.cz"&gt;python.cz&lt;/a&gt;. Dalo mi to celkem práci, nakonec jsem zjistil, že nějaký linter vydal novou verzi a něco jiného s tím nepočítalo. Udělal jsem různé další upgrady, vyřešil některé staré resty a na jednom místě jsem linter prostě odebral, protože jsem neměl morál na to to řešit. Stejně by tam jednou měl být všude &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/black/"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upgradoval jsem Python na JG a u sebe v počítači z 3.8 na 3.10.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pyenv jsem přeinstaloval tak, aby nepoužíval na mém M1 macOS Rosettu, ale byl nativně na Siliconu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upgradoval jsem Node.js na JG a u sebe v počítači ze 14 na 16.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upgradoval jsem legacy Docker images v CircleCI na nové.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Čistil jsem nepotřebné závislosti z projektu a upgradoval jiné.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="finalizace-stranky-o-psychickem-zdravi"&gt;Finalizace stránky o psychickém zdraví&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#finalizace-stranky-o-psychickem-zdravi" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tady přichází onen &lt;em&gt;yak shaving&lt;/em&gt;. V rámci prokrastinace psaní tipů, ale taky v rámci svých priorit na tento týden, jsem se pustil do finalizace stránky o psychickém zdraví, která už byla celá napsaná, stačilo jen překopírovat texty z Google Docs do Markdown souboru. Práce na 15 minut, že?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Text jsem prošel a udělal ještě pár kosmetických editací. Začal jsem pak text předělávat do Markdownu. Bylo tam hodně seznamů s užitečnými odkazy, které v příručce na JG mají vždy boxík a v boxíku je i screenshot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proces vytváření screenshotů byl doteď manuální: Vytvořit kartu v Markdownu, dát tam URL, dát tam cestu k budoucímu obrázku, Přidat URL do texťáku se seznamem URL, spustit skript na screenshoty. To mě teď brzo přestalo bavit a hlavně jsem zjistil, že jak jsem různé věci upgradoval, &lt;a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/pageres/issues/420"&gt;nejsem schopen knihovnu na screenshoty už nainstalovat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rozhodl jsem se, že to takhle dál nejde a šel jsem ty screenshoty předělávat. Autor knihovny &lt;code&gt;pageres&lt;/code&gt; má novější, &lt;code&gt;capture-website&lt;/code&gt;, ale pak jsem si vzpomněl ještě na to, že Simon Willison &lt;a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Mar/14/scraping-web-pages-shot-scraper/"&gt;psal o nějakém udělátku na screenshoty&lt;/a&gt; a tak jsem to šel prozkoumat. Trocha studování, jak to funguje a nakonec jsem teda použil přímo &lt;a href="https://playwright.dev/"&gt;playwright&lt;/a&gt; přes jeho Python knihovnu. Funguje to krásně a dokonce to zjednodušuje i proces instalace browseru, který se na screenshoty použije a nemusím instalaci nikde komplikovaně řešit, ať už je to u mě na počítači, nebo na CircleCI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Začal jsem kompletně předělávat, jak funguje screenshotovací skript, jak se vyhodnocuje co se stáhne a jak, předělal jsem stahování cover obrázků FB skupin, ladil jsem různé CSS selektory, díky kterým na screenshotech nejsou cookies lišty apod. smetí, no prostě vložil jsem do toho hodiny a hodiny času. Vždy jsem o něco zavadil a zjistil, že to musím předělat taky. Řešil jsem také, jak by to mohlo dělat screenshoty samotného JG, protože na dvou (a v budoucnu na víc) místech to potřebuji.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Každopádně ten playwright je super a díky Python knihovně můžu jednoduše ovládat browser na pár řádcích, nemusím nad tím moc přemýšlet (na rozdíl od Selenia) a nemusím pouštět žádný JavaScript jako subprocess, nebo něco podobného. Screenshot to umí vrátit rovnou jako bajty, což je fajn, pokud jej chci před uložením ještě upravit, apod. Slibuji si od toho zrychlení některých operací a zjednodušení kódu, méně žonglování mezi procesy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nakonec jsem do playwrightu předělal i kód, který mi z HTML generuje obrázky (např. náhledy pro sociální sítě, plakátky pro přednášky v klubu, plakátky pro podcasty, apod.) a &lt;code&gt;pageres&lt;/code&gt; úplně vyhodil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pak jsem ještě dodělal kód, který prochází všechny vygenerované HTML soubory webu a hledá odkazy na screenshoty. Tyto pak bere skript na screenshoty jako „požadavky na screenshot“. Když screenshot existuje, tak v pohodě, když ne, tak ho udělá.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dva měsíce staré screenshoty automaticky expiruje, takže na to nemusím myslet a stačí prostě čas od času skript na screenshoty ručně pustit (třeba když potřebuju screenshotovat nový odkaz) a on vše vyřeší za mě. Tím pak ještě vznikl prostor pro to, abych vůbec nemusel do Markdownu psát cestu k souboru se screenshotem. Vygeneruje se sama přímo z URL a screenshotovací skript už ji jen použije jako cestu k souboru, který má hledat a případně vytvořit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ještě jsem měl v kódu skript, který ve výsledném HTML hledal rozbité odkazy na #idčka v textu. Ten jsem rozšířil a přidal kontrolu všech odkazů mezi stránkami a k tomu potom ještě kontrolu obrázků, jestli existují. To mi pomohlo vychytat, jestli jsem při všech těch změnách na něco nezapomněl. Frozen-Flask totiž rozbité odkazy tak nějak kontroluje sám od sebe a spadne, když odkaz nikam nevede, ale MkDocs, mám dojem, už moc ne, prostě tam vygeneruje klidně hloupost a neřeší to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pak jsem teda stránku o psychice dosázel do Markdownu, radoval se jak vše hezky funguje, a poslal to &lt;a href="https://www.nelaprovazi.cz/"&gt;Nele&lt;/a&gt;, se kterou jsme to psali. Nela řekla, že je to super, ale ať počkám se spuštěním, takže to teď ani neukážu, ten skvost, ale je už připravený. V plánu je spustit to brzy, za týden nebo dva.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tož to bylo zhruba tři dny místo patnácti minut. Selhání? No jako jo, sice jsem si škrtl jednu věc, kterou jsem dlouho odsouval, ale tři dny zabrat fakt neměla a neměl jsem komplet předělat, jak se dělají na JG screenshoty. Ale mě se asi fakt nechtělo zrovna nic psát a to programování mě doopravdy bavilo. A čím jednodušší budou editace v příručce, tím častěji je budu dělat a něco přidávat. Chtělo by se mi napsat, že se díky tomu všemu zrychlil build na CircleCI, protože se věci instalují rychleji a screenshoty se dělají rychleji, ale není to rychlejší. Jestli, tak třeba o minutu. No nic, příští týden už opravdu ten onboarding dodělám.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Půjčil jsem Danovi elektrický kávový mlýnek, aby mohl vařit kafe na &lt;a href="https://realuxcamp.com/"&gt;RealUXCamp&lt;/a&gt; 2022. Dal mi na víkend ruční mlýnek. Myslel jsem, že to bude romantické, mlít to zase rukou, ale je to spíš nekonečné. Škoda, že to nemůžu naučit naše batole, které by to asi bavilo víc. Dan ode mě dostal i JG samolepky a doufám, že jich tam rozdá co nejvíc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zabýval jsem se dalším stipendiem. Napadlo mě u toho, že je to teď skoro jedno stipendium týdně a že „stipendium &lt;em&gt;is new&lt;/em&gt; nový pracovní inzerát na junior.guru/jobs“, tedy manuální činnost, kterou dělám už příliš často na to, aby to takhle šlo dělat dál. Mám nějaké nápady, jak to automatizovat, ale všechno je to moc práce, tak počkám, jak se to bude vyvíjet, nebo jestli mě nenapadne něco ještě jednoduššího.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dostal jsem pozvánku na &lt;a href="https://www.hackercamp.cz/"&gt;hackercamp.cz&lt;/a&gt;, ale nebudu nejspíš v té době vůbec v ČR. Aspoň doufám. Větší dovolenou jsem pořád nedokázal vymyslet a naplánovat. Ortéza teď navíc vše komplikuje.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Koukal jsem, že Discord to myslí s komunitami vážně a vytvořil pro ně &lt;a href="https://discord.com/community"&gt;celý speciální portál&lt;/a&gt; a video pro začínající komunitní adminy .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sociální sítě jsem zanedbával a nic na ně nedával. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1555639353740853248"&gt;Posteskl jsem si na Twitteru&lt;/a&gt;, že už mě moc nebaví. Pak už jen pár storíček o tom, jak ve Žďáře nad Sázavou chybí přechody nebo tweet o tom, jak &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1557012318134976515"&gt;starostka Prahy 5 zbytečně brání výstavbě&lt;/a&gt;. To si vysloužilo skoro 170 srdíček. Dělám to dobře, tu kampaň, že? Škoda, že srdíčka nejsou hlasy. A škoda, že nekandiduju ani ve Žďáře, ani na Praze 5, ale na Praze 3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upravil jsem ještě dvakrát uvítací zprávu, kterou bot posílá novým členům. Vylepšuju krůček za krůčkem podle toho, jak to (ne)funguje na lidi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Klub, maily, a tak dále. Tento týden byl v tomto směru naštěstí celkem klidný.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 7 dní od 6.8. do 12.8. jsem při procházkách nachodil 19 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 14 hodin a zdolal při tom 19 kilometrů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aktuální finanční výsledky, návštěvnost a další čísla k JG &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;mám přímo na webu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="co-planuji"&gt;Co plánuji&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#co-planuji" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dvě věci, které bych chtěl zvládnout udělat příště:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dodělat první verzi zpráv pro onboarding a pustit je do první testovací skupiny lidí.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vymyslet nový ceník pro firmy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zpracovat poznámky z hovoru s mentorem a prodiskutovat je s ostatními mentory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-co-vy"&gt;A co vy?&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#a-co-vy" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud byste čistě náhodou měli dojem, že jste oproti mě za uplynulý týden vůbec nic nestihli, tak mám pro vás skvělou zprávu! V klidu se na ten dojem &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/neni-to-zavod/"&gt;můžete vykašlat&lt;/a&gt;. Není zač!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="co-me-zaujalo"&gt;Co mě zaujalo&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#co-me-zaujalo" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když si něco přečtu nebo poslechnu a líbí se mi to, &lt;a href="https://getpocket.com/@honzajavorek"&gt;sdílím to na Pocketu&lt;/a&gt;. Od posledních poznámek jsem sdílel toto:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6sCsOdqXQw"&gt;Will Taiwan Trigger WW3 by 2027?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.voxpot.cz/cinska-armada-je-na-nohou-a-cvici-kolem-tchaj-wanu-o-jake-vojsko-jde/"&gt;Čínská armáda je na nohou a cvičí kolem Tchaj-wanu. O jaké vojsko jde?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Není to vše, co jsem přečetl, slyšel nebo viděl, ale jen zlomek, který mě zaujal. K vygenerování tohoto seznamu jsem použil vlastní knihovnu &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/pocket-recommendations/"&gt;pocket-recommendations&lt;/a&gt;. Věci, které jsem sdílel v den psaní minulých poznámek, se opakují i v těch dalších a je to záměr, ne chyba.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category><category term="týdenní poznámky"></category><category term="junior.guru"></category></entry><entry><title>Týdenní poznámky #100: Marketingová konzultace a psaní tipů do onboardingu</title><link href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/tydenni-poznamky-100-marketingova-konzultace-a-psani-tipu-do-onboardingu/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-08-05T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2022-08-05T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Honza Javorek</name></author><id>tag:honzajavorek.cz,2022-08-05:/blog/tydenni-poznamky-100-marketingova-konzultace-a-psani-tipu-do-onboardingu/</id><summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utekl zase nějaký ten týden (30.7. — 5.8.) a tak &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/tydenni-poznamky-99-diskutovani-v-klubu-kolo-a-onboarding/"&gt;stejně jako minule&lt;/a&gt; sepisuji, co jsem dělal a co zajímavého jsem se naučil.

&lt;p&gt;Sté poznámky! Když jsem poznámky začal psát, nechtělo se mi moc věřit, že zvládnu napsat víc jak dvoje. A hle, napsal jsem jich sto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poznámky píšu z velké části pro sebe, ale taky pro vás, pro čtenáře mých poznámek. Vtipné je, že o vás vlastně nic nevím. Vím, že to tady čtou moji rodiče, brácha a pár kámošů, kteří mi napsali, že to rádi čtou. Tuším ale, &lt;a href="https://simpleanalytics.com/honzajavorek.cz?period=month&amp;amp;search=paths%3Atydenni-poznamky"&gt;že je vás víc&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No a nic jiného vlastně ani netuším. Dovedu si představit, že u mnoha lidí počáteční nadšení opadlo a přestalo je to tady bavit číst. Kamarád Jakub už mi neposílá v pátek dopoledne memy o tom, jak čeká, až poznámky vyjdou.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A vlastně vůbec nevím, kdo další to tady čte. Nevím, jestli jste studenti, podnikatelé, moji kamarádi, junioři z klubu, hvězdy z obálky Forbesu, nebo jste, stejně jako většina návštěvníků mého blogu, hledali &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/sob-a-los/"&gt;rozdíl mezi sobem a losem&lt;/a&gt; a když už vás sem Google hodil, tak jste objevili i poznámky a z nějakého nevysvětlitelného důvodu jste je začali pravidelně číst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nemám tu ani komentáře, díky kterým bych mohl některé z vás blíž poznat. Přitom díky komentářům na blogu jsem se kdysi seznámil s velmi zajímavými lidmi. Každé poznámky sdílím k sobě na Twitter a na Facebook, ale tam k tomu moc komentářů nedostávám. Pokud to tady čtete rádi, napište občas něco :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tydenni-zurnal-lukase-augusty"&gt;Týdenní žurnál Lukáše Augusty&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#tydenni-zurnal-lukase-augusty" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lukáš Augusta, který tvoří &lt;a href="https://www.designui.cz/"&gt;Designui&lt;/a&gt;, se mě ptal, jestli není blbé, když můj koncept okopíruje a začne taky psát poznámky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pro všechny z vás, kterým by to taky vrtalo hlavou, já jsem týdenní poznámky fakt nevynalezl :) Nejvíc mě k tomu inspiroval &lt;a href="https://simonwillison.net/"&gt;Simon Willison&lt;/a&gt;, ale už kdysi jsem podobně sledoval &lt;a href="https://www.nogol.cz/blog/"&gt;blog Davida Nogola&lt;/a&gt;, když v roce 2012 sekl s programováním a začal fotit. Psal, jak nemá na nájem, apod. Nevím, jestli to tam ještě někde má, nebo už je to jen ve webarchivech, jsem líný to hledat, ale hodně mě to tenkrát bavilo číst. Stejně tak jsem kdysi sledoval, &lt;a href="https://dokosiku.blogspot.com/"&gt;jak vzniká eshop u Marka Prokopa&lt;/a&gt;, ze kterého se pak vyklubal &lt;a href="https://cajtydne.cz/"&gt;Čaj týdne&lt;/a&gt;, nebo jsem si četl &lt;a href="https://www.podnikanivusa.com/"&gt;o počátcích podnikání Johna Vanhary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No a někteří kamarádi píšou, možná i trochu po mém vzoru, poznámky taky: &lt;a href="https://almad.blog/notes/"&gt;Lukáš Linhart &lt;em&gt;aka&lt;/em&gt; Almad&lt;/a&gt;, nebo &lt;a href="https://smizell.com/categories/weeknotes/"&gt;Stephen Mizell&lt;/a&gt;. Takže kdo chcete psát poznámky, klidně je pište, svolení ode mě určitě nepotřebujete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Třeba tak vznikne další pěkný záznam o tom, jak reálně vypadá cesta za nějakým cílem, ať už je tím cílem cokoliv. Já třeba nevěřím na jednoduché cesty a jednoduchá řešení. Podle mě je realita vždy složitější, než to, co jde vidět navenek. Až jednou budu na obálce Forbesu a oni se mě budou ptát na recept na úspěch, nebudu si muset vymýšlet žádné zjednodušující moudro. Prostě řeknu: „Přečtěte si mých 5873 týdenních poznámek a budete mít jasnější obrázek o tom, jak se mi to povedlo.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Držím Lukášovi Augustovi palce. Jeho první poznámky najdete pod názvem &lt;a href="https://www.lukasaugusta.cz/tydenni-zurnal/1-proc-zacinam-delat-tydenni-zaznamy"&gt;týdenní žurnál&lt;/a&gt;. Musím říct, že minimálně designově to má teda vyladěnější :D Pro staromilce, RSS je &lt;a href="https://www.lukasaugusta.cz/tydenni-zurnal/rss.xml"&gt;tady&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="marketingova-konzultace"&gt;Marketingová konzultace&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#marketingova-konzultace" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tento týden se odehrála moje konzultace u &lt;a href="https://www.janadolejsova.cz/"&gt;Jany Dolejšové&lt;/a&gt;. Než jsme si zavolali, poslala mi dotazník, který jsem půl dne vyplňoval. Jednak jsem si u toho i sám uspořádal myšlenky, jednak jsem chtěl dodat co nejvíc kontextu, protože moje podnikání je myslím dost specifické a má různé ne úplně standardní hodnoty, kterých se chci držet. Také jsem to, zcela nečekaně, ehm, pojal trochu jako diplomku. Řekla mi, že nikdo jiný jí to tak detailně nevyplnil, ale usmívala se u toho a zdálo se mi, že za to byla spíš ráda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ve středu jsme si zavolali a bylo to fakt super. Nejde o to, že by mi říkala nějaká marketingová tajemství, nebo že by mi za hodinu vyrobila marketingový strategický plán. Okomentovala mou situaci, poradila mi, co můžu dělat, co bych si měl prioritně ujasnit, kde bych měl posbírat v zásadě primitivní, ale dostatečná data, která mi strašně pomohou s rozhodováním. Navrhla mi, jak si mohu zorganizovat sociální sítě, nebo jak mohu své marketingové aktivity osekat a podle jakého klíče. Mám hromadu poznámek a ještě to stále vstřebávám, ale bylo to, minimálně pro můj účel, strašně užitečné! Vlastně jsem si přesně tohle představoval a přesně tohle jsem doufal, že dostanu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mám z toho radost. Je fakt rozdíl, když dostanu nápad a je to jen jeden z mnoha nápadů, které mám, nebo když jsem ten nápad řekl jí a ona mi hned odpověděla „jasně, tohle většinou funguje hodně dobře, toto nevyužíváte dostatečně a určitě se do toho pusťte, můžete udělat ještě to a to a to“. Je to jako bych si zaplatil hodinu a díky té hodině přeskočil půl roku nebo rok nějakých pokus-omylů.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jako první věc bych měl během onboardingu začít sbírat informaci o tom, kde mě lidi našli, abych měl aspoň hrubou představu o tom, co z věcí, které dělám, má jakou efektivitu. Potom si to musím dát dohromady s tím, co mi řekla dalšího a nechat si to projít hlavou a vymyslet, jak to teda po novém celé pojmu, co změním, co zruším, co začnu dělat nového.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nic-moc-produktivita"&gt;Nic moc produktivita&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#nic-moc-produktivita" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kvůli dvěma věcem jsem nebyl tento týden příliš produktivní. V pondělí šla žena na badminton a natáhla si tam nohu, takže teď chodí s nohou zafixovanou a nemůže toho zas tak moc dělat. Snížil jsem tedy pracovní nasazení pocitově na polovinu, abych mohl víc pečovat o dítě, a hlavně mi skoro zmizel čas, kdy se mohu do něčeho ponořit. Takže maily nebo klub jsem vyřídil, ale psaní nebo programování se moc nedělo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Další věc byl deficit spánku, který se mi nějak zase nasbíral, kombinovaný s horkem a nedostatkem čerstvého vzduchu u nás doma. To se mi pak chce celý den jenom spát nebo se skoro nehýbat, hlava mi nemyslí, jsem prostě taková zombie. Opět něco, v čem zvládnu vyřešit maily, ale na hlubokou práci to není. V noci se taky moc větrat nedařilo, takže bída. Naštěstí se má trochu ochladit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="onboarding"&gt;Onboarding&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#onboarding" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Změnil jsem zprávu, kterou píše bot všem novým lidem do vláken v kanálu #ahoj. Nyní se tam zmiňuje, že existuje &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/handbook/"&gt;příručka&lt;/a&gt; a že je tam deset fází juniora. Na konci zprávy je prosba, aby člověk napsal, v jaké si myslí, že zrovna je fázi. Už se to pár lidem takhle nově poslalo, ale zatím nevím o tom, že by na to někdo odpověděl :( Asi to nečtou.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pak jsem se snažil psát tipy pro onboarding do Google dokumentu a probírat to s Danem, ale psaní mi jde pomalu. Po dni práce jsem přidal jeden nebo dva, takže stále ještě nemám ani těch pět pro MVP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V pondělí jsem běhal po městě, protože řešíme nějakou byrokracii pro &lt;a href="https://pyvec.org/"&gt;Pyvec&lt;/a&gt; a bylo potřeba se sejít s kamarádem, ověřit podpis na poště, zajít k advokátce a vyřídit další podpisy. Protože není z Prahy a delší dobu jsme neměli čas pokecat, zašli jsme ještě na oběd a na kafe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Michal Kašpárek napsal &lt;a href="https://finmag.penize.cz/veda-a-technika/435552-jak-zacit-programovat-v-pythonu-finmag-newsletter-tentokrat-jinak"&gt;článek o tom, jak začít s Pythonem&lt;/a&gt; a hned dvakrát odkázal na junior.guru!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stačilo napsat pět emailů, podepsat několik smluv, nechat si poslat doporučený dopis a zajít pro něj na poštu, přijmout jeden hovor, čekat půl roku a… je to! Náš podcast se konečně &lt;a href="https://podcasty.seznam.cz/podcast/junior-guru-podcast"&gt;objevil na podcasty.cz od Seznamu&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zjistil jsem, že můj skript na rušení buildů v CircleCI nefunguje úplně přesně jak bych potřeboval (build ze staršího commitu zruší build z novějšího, pokud se k tomu dostane dřív) a opravoval jsem to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kamarádka se mi ozvala s tím, že má kurz koučinku a jestli nevymyslíme něco pro lidi v klubu. Seznamoval jsem ji s různými možnostmi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do klubu jsem dal zmínku o tom, že v &lt;a href="https://jetveo.io"&gt;Jetveo&lt;/a&gt; hledají dva juniory z Brna, které by zaučili, aby pro klienty pracovali na jejich platformě. Jak takové zaučování vypadá si můžete přečíst &lt;a href="https://jetveo.io/cs/blog/articles/jakub-interview"&gt;tady&lt;/a&gt;. Kdyžtak se jim ozvěte.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dcera měla rok :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na sociální sítě jsem nic nedal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Klubu jsem se věnoval hodně, četl, odpovídal. Totéž maily, vyřídil jsem jich minimálně k osmdesáti, zprocesoval jedno stipendium, &lt;a href="https://www.donio.cz/taborprodeti"&gt;doporučil jednu dobročinnou sbírku&lt;/a&gt; do pár IT firem, vyřizoval ještě pár věcí pro Pyvec, atd.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poprvé v životě jsem jel na Rekole. Osmělil jsem se díky „lítačkovému“ tarifu. První dojmy? Appka plná errorů (kliknu na tlačítko a zobrazí se JSON? oukej...), ale kolo super, jede se na něm pohodlně. Na Žižkově žádná kola nejsou, našel jsem jedno poslední zastrčené, protože Žižkov je kopec a kola jsou všude jinde, především v Karlíně. Jel jsem na Hlavní nádraží, ale u nového zadního vchodu ze Žižkova chybí zóna na vrácení. Chybová hláška v appce, že nemůžu vrátit kolo, mi řekla jen to, že nemůžu vrátit kolo. Nenapsala důvod, takže jsem to zkusil desetkrát na jiném místě a vzdal to. Na supportu mi řekli, že musím nejdřív ručně zamknout kolo. To mi ovšem appka nikde nenapsala a nebylo to intuitivní, vůbec mě to nenapadlo, protože se moje kolo odemklo elektronicky samo skrze tlačítko v appce. Peníze, které mi to strhlo, protože jsem nestihl kolo vrátit včas, mi hned vrátili. Celkové hodnocení: smíšené pocity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 7 dní od 30.7. do 5.8. jsem při procházkách nachodil 3 km, ujel na kole 8 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 3 hodiny a zdolal při tom 11 kilometrů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aktuální finanční výsledky, návštěvnost a další čísla k JG &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;mám přímo na webu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="co-planuji"&gt;Co plánuji&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#co-planuji" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tři věci, které bych chtěl zvládnout udělat příště? Stejné jako minule :(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dodělat první verzi zpráv pro onboarding a pustit je do první testovací skupiny lidí.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zpracovat poznámky z hovoru s mentorem a prodiskutovat je s ostatními mentory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dorazit kapitolu o psychice při změně kariéry do příručky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-co-vy"&gt;A co vy?&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#a-co-vy" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud byste čistě náhodou měli dojem, že jste oproti mě za uplynulý týden vůbec nic nestihli, tak mám pro vás skvělou zprávu! V klidu se na ten dojem &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/neni-to-zavod/"&gt;můžete vykašlat&lt;/a&gt;. Není zač!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="co-me-zaujalo"&gt;Co mě zaujalo&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#co-me-zaujalo" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když si něco přečtu nebo poslechnu a líbí se mi to, &lt;a href="https://getpocket.com/@honzajavorek"&gt;sdílím to na Pocketu&lt;/a&gt;. Od posledních poznámek jsem sdílel toto:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mujrozhlas.cz/rapi/view/episode/f54259a8-34cb-39d0-bb61-a47bd7a3f6fe"&gt;Dospělí a ADHD - nemáte ho taky? Snáz se pozná a lidé jsou ochotnější problémy řešit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hmmm…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://overcast.fm/+Wv2Sr88zI"&gt;Gebrian: Zácpy způsobují pohodlní a bezohlední lidé, měli by platit mýtné, nebo neuvěřitelně drahé parkování - Prostor X podcast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ano.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Není to vše, co jsem přečetl, slyšel nebo viděl, ale jen zlomek, který mě zaujal. K vygenerování tohoto seznamu jsem použil vlastní knihovnu &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/pocket-recommendations/"&gt;pocket-recommendations&lt;/a&gt;. Věci, které jsem sdílel v den psaní minulých poznámek, se opakují i v těch dalších a je to záměr, ne chyba.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category><category term="týdenní poznámky"></category><category term="junior.guru"></category></entry><entry><title>Týdenní poznámky #99: Diskutování v klubu, kolo a onboarding</title><link href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/tydenni-poznamky-99-diskutovani-v-klubu-kolo-a-onboarding/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-07-29T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2022-07-29T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Honza Javorek</name></author><id>tag:honzajavorek.cz,2022-07-29:/blog/tydenni-poznamky-99-diskutovani-v-klubu-kolo-a-onboarding/</id><summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utekl zase nějaký ten týden (23.7. — 29.7.) a tak &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/tydenni-poznamky-98-kandidatura-a-programovani-onboardingu/"&gt;stejně jako minule&lt;/a&gt; sepisuji, co jsem dělal a co zajímavého jsem se naučil.

&lt;h2 id="onboarding-a-souvisejici-zmeny"&gt;Onboarding a související změny&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#onboarding-a-souvisejici-zmeny" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V rámci práce na onboardingu do klubu jsem chtěl přepracovat i FAQ na webu. Jedna z malých věcí, které jsem chtěl už delší dobu změnit, bylo to, jak je FAQ prezentováno na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/club/"&gt;stránce klubu&lt;/a&gt;. Dole byla jedna věta a jedno tlačítko. Předělal jsem to na seznam ikonek, které vedou na témata dovnitř FAQ. Je to prozatimní verze, ideálně by tam byly ikony, nadpisy různých témat a pod tím odkazy na jednotlivé situace. Nebo přímo ty konkrétní situace, které lidi fakt často řeší, např. ohledně Discordu nebo placení. To zase příště.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pak jsem konečně vytvořil dokument sdílený s Danem, kam jsem začal psát nástřely jednotlivých tipů v onboardingu. Hned ten první mi zabral dost času a uvědomil jsem si u toho hodně souvislostí, díky kterým jsem pak prioritizoval třeba vytvoření &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/handbook/"&gt;úvodní stránky pro příručku&lt;/a&gt;. Tu jsem samozřejmě plánoval velkolepější a lepší, ale došlo mi, že prostě už fakt potřebuju, aby existovala, že na ni chci z onboardingu odkázat, že tam chci mít těch deset fází juniora, atd. Takže &lt;em&gt;continuous delivery&lt;/em&gt; a &lt;em&gt;good enough&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OzolinsJanis/status/1552590693423583232"&gt;vypnul jsem perfekcionismus&lt;/a&gt; a stránka byla do hodiny hotová. Fáze juniora jsou ústředním motivem této stránky a časem se ideálně stanou tak trochu kostrou příručky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Při vytváření onboardingu jsem si četl o tom, &lt;a href="https://village.rosie.land/t/spicy-take-i-dont-want-to-be-onboarded-in-communities/531/9"&gt;jak Rosie nechce být onboardována&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jezdeni-na-kole-a-administrativa"&gt;Ježdení na kole a administrativa&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#jezdeni-na-kole-a-administrativa" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Byli jsme opět na vesnici u Zlína, u babičky, což jsem využil zase jako příležitost pro takovou poloviční dovolenou a nějaké vlastní aktivity. Vzal jsem si s sebou z Prahy vlakem kolo a jezdil jsem tady trochu na kole po okolí. Od březnové 300km jízdy v 0+ stupních jsem na kole neseděl, teď jsem vyrazil ve 30+ stupních, ale bylo to fajn. Nejdřív po placce, pak jsem dal i nějaké kopečky a snažil se jezdit rychleji, než jsem zvyklý. Celkem to šlo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tím, jak jsem se k práci dostal spíš sem a tam, tak jsem dost týdne obětoval na administrativu místo nějaké soustředěné práce. Taky se toho dost dělo v klubu. Jako by se lidi vrátili z dovolených a najednou se v klubu po pár týdnech „ticha“ začalo psát 100+ příspěvků denně. Bavilo mě to sledovat a přispívat, méně mě bavilo hlídat ať do sebe lidi neryjou, ale to k tomu patří. Proběhlo hned několik vášnivějších diskuzí a často jsem diskutováním v klubu strávil třeba i půlden času.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taky začaly zase chodit maily a měl jsem co dělat, abych je vůbec stíhal číst. Zazdil jsem kvůli tomu i jeden domluvený call. Pár domluvených callů jsem ale stihl: Engeto, Red Hat, House of Řezáč. S někým domlouvám partnerství, s někým připravujeme přednášku v klubu. S Engetem budeme spolupracovat na nějaké větší společné věci, podobně jako vloni na video příručce. Hned jsme si k tomu založili sdílený Google doc a pomaličku na tom začneme pracovat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsal jsem pro členy klubu seznam Facebookových skupin, kde lze hledat nebo poptávat práce v IT. S varováním, že mnohé z nich jsou fakt toxické džungle a že z toho bude spousta nějakého spamu a nesmyslných nabídek, ale že na některé specifické účely to posloužit může.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pyvec"&gt;Pyvec&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#pyvec" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Měli jsme schůzi výboru &lt;a href="https://pyvec.org/"&gt;Pyvce&lt;/a&gt;. Následně jsme s advokátkou řešili nějakou byrokracii kolem vedení Pyvce. Bohužel budeme potřebovat hromadu podpisů a plnou moc. Abychom se někam posunuli, strávil jsem celé jedno dopoledne na telefonech. V pondělí kolem toho budu ještě běhat po Praze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na základě jednoho dotazu jsem se podíval do dokumentace Slacku a zjistil, že nonprofits asi &lt;a href="https://slack.com/help/articles/204368833-Apply-for-the-Slack-for-Nonprofits-discount"&gt;nejsou omezené na jeden Slack workspace zdarma&lt;/a&gt;, což jsem si původně myslel. Takže si možná nějaké skupiny v Python komunitě, kterým nevyhovuje alternativa v podobě Discordu, zažádají o Pro účet zdarma. Uvidíme, jak to dopadne a jestli nám to dají, když už jeden Slack na Pro účtu takhle zadarmo máme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zkoumal jsem, proč můj build na CircleCI zase trvá skoro 40 minut a identifikoval minimálně tři věci, které bych mohl optimalizovat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na LinkedIn mě oslovila &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/senanursahin/"&gt;Sena Şahin&lt;/a&gt; a ptala se, jestli nevím někde po Praze, kde by ji mohli vzít, když teď dokončila školu (informatiku) a zaměřuje se na AI a ML. Zaujalo mě, jak má promakané CVčko, motivační dopis, tady má &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@xenagarage"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;, no prostě většina juniorů co znám, by se od ní mohla učit. Tak jsem jí odepsal a snažil se jí poradit, kam může napsat a kde to může zkusit. Taky jsem to její CVčko hodil kamarádovi do firmy, která s AI dělá. Blbé je, že Sena potřebuje vízum, protože je z Turecka. Držím jí palce, aby si místo našla a aby to s ní nějaká firma zkusila, vypadá už jen tou proaktivitou hodně šikovně. Kdybyste o něčem věděli, napište jí (nebo mně a já jí to pošlu).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psal jsem si s Lukášem Augustou, který tvoří &lt;a href="https://www.designui.cz/"&gt;Designui&lt;/a&gt;, což je projekt, který mi je hodně sympatický a dokonce jsem se tam spoustu věcí i naučil. Bavili jsme se o tom, že si asi taky začne psát poznámky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jedno zaslané stipendium jsem zamítl s tím, že žadatelka nevyplnila dostatečně formulář tak, abych se dokázal jakkoliv rozhodnout o tom, jestli stipendium udělit, nebo ne. Věty o čtyřech slovech opravdu nestačí.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zkusil jsem vyrobit &lt;a href="https://zlin.rozhlas.cz/toust-s-kozim-syrem-8157157"&gt;toust s kozím sýrem&lt;/a&gt; a bylo to dobré.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Už nějakou dobu mě zlobilo poetry a vyhazovalo při úplně každém příkazu varování. Našel jsem konečně &lt;a href="https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/5210"&gt;čím to je&lt;/a&gt;, poetry přeinstaloval a varování zmizelo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sociální sítě: Propagoval jsem &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/podcast/"&gt;nový díl podcastu&lt;/a&gt; a jinak jsem to zase spíš flákal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oslavili jsme jeden rok našeho děcka!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 7 dní od 23.7. do 29.7. jsem naběhal 10 km, při procházkách nachodil 3 km, ujel na kole 116 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 11 hodin a zdolal při tom 129 kilometrů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aktuální finanční výsledky, návštěvnost a další čísla k JG &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;mám přímo na webu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tři věci, které bych chtěl zvládnout udělat příště:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dodělat první verzi zpráv pro onboarding a pustit je do první testovací skupiny lidí.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zpracovat poznámky z hovoru s mentorem a prodiskutovat je s ostatními mentory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dorazit kapitolu o psychice při změně kariéry do příručky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-co-vy"&gt;A co vy?&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#a-co-vy" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud byste čistě náhodou měli dojem, že jste oproti mě za uplynulý týden vůbec nic nestihli, tak mám pro vás skvělou zprávu! V klidu se na ten dojem &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/neni-to-zavod/"&gt;můžete vykašlat&lt;/a&gt;. Není zač!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="co-me-zaujalo"&gt;Co mě zaujalo&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#co-me-zaujalo" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když si něco přečtu nebo poslechnu a líbí se mi to, &lt;a href="https://getpocket.com/@honzajavorek"&gt;sdílím to na Pocketu&lt;/a&gt;. Od posledních poznámek jsem sdílel toto:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://alexwlchan.net/2022/07/screenshots/"&gt;You should take more screenshots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Přesně tak. Taky dělám poslední dobou víc a víc screenshotů, čistě pro archivní účely. Škoda, že jsem s tím nezačal dříve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mujrozhlas.cz/rapi/view/episode/f54259a8-34cb-39d0-bb61-a47bd7a3f6fe"&gt;Dospělí a ADHD - nemáte ho taky? Snáz se pozná a lidé jsou ochotnější problémy řešit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hmmm…&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Není to vše, co jsem přečetl, slyšel nebo viděl, ale jen zlomek, který mě zaujal. K vygenerování tohoto seznamu jsem použil vlastní knihovnu &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/pocket-recommendations/"&gt;pocket-recommendations&lt;/a&gt;. Věci, které jsem sdílel v den psaní minulých poznámek, se opakují i v těch dalších a je to záměr, ne chyba.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category><category term="týdenní poznámky"></category><category term="junior.guru"></category></entry><entry><title>Týdenní poznámky #98: Kandidatura a programování onboardingu</title><link href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/tydenni-poznamky-98-kandidatura-a-programovani-onboardingu/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-07-22T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2022-07-22T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Honza Javorek</name></author><id>tag:honzajavorek.cz,2022-07-22:/blog/tydenni-poznamky-98-kandidatura-a-programovani-onboardingu/</id><summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utekl zase nějaký ten týden (16.7. — 22.7.) a tak &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/tydenni-poznamky-97-debugovani-a-onboarding/"&gt;stejně jako minule&lt;/a&gt; sepisuji, co jsem dělal a co zajímavého jsem se naučil.

&lt;p&gt;Tak je zase pátek a já zase píšu z vlaku. Tentokrát bereme kromě dítěte v nosítku taky moje kolo. V poměru tři dospělí (my dva a babička) na jedno dítě se dá docela dobře zorganizovat si běhání skoro na každý večer, ale v těch vedrech co teď jsou moje motivace na běhání dost klesá. Popravdě, běhání v horku je humus a chci u něj spíš umřít než cokoliv jiného. Ráno nemám morál a stejně je vedro už brzo, večer je vedro i za tmy. Takže zkusím kolo, to by mohlo být v horku příjemnější a bude to změna. Na kole jsem od březnové jízdy napříč republikou prakticky neseděl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="onboarding"&gt;Onboarding&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#onboarding" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Většinu týdne jsem pracoval na onboardingu a lepším vítání nových členů v klubu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ladil jsem trochu ještě zakládání a správu privátních kanálů na tipy, které bude dostávat každý nový člen. Upravil jsem kód tak, aby se kanál nesmazal aspoň ještě pár měsíců, pokud člen odejde z klubu. Často se stane, že lidem vyprší karta, nebo že z klubu na chvíli zmizí a pak se vrátí. Bylo by otravné, kdyby se jim restartoval celý onboarding a začaly jim chodit opět tytéž tipy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rozšířil jsem skript, který už nyní zjišťoval, jestli se nově příchozí člen přidal poprvé, nebo v klubu už někdy byl. Takovým členům skript přidal k uvítací zprávě emoji s mávající rukou a s recyklujícími se špikami, abych to viděl a měl zhruba přehled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Přidal jsem do toho kód, který pro každého člena identifikuje jeho představovací zprávu v kanálu #ahoj. S tím plánuji pracovat víc do budoucna, teď se to hodilo hlavně proto, aby pod ni bot dokázal dát emoji s mávající rukou a pár dalších takových, vítacích. Také tuto zprávu promění ve vlákno, do kterého se představí jako bot a napíše jednoduché uvítání. Do těchto vláken budu pak psát já a lidi ještě vítat i ručně, osobně, ale bude to bonus a pokud přijde deset nových lidí najednou, nebudu se muset bát, že nebudu stíhat a zůstanou zcela neuvítaní. Vlákna se navíc dají využít všelijak a už teď se tam celkem komentuje. Přesunula se tam určitá část diskuze z obecného pokecu a podle mě to teď bude přehlednější, diskuze bude líp škálovat pro víc lidí a když bude něco zajímavého pro všechny, vždy to můžeme jako moderátoři vytáhnout do těch obecných kanálů. Do zprávy od bota jsem se nesnažil nacpat moc informací, protože ty by pak měly být spíš v tom privátním kanálu na tipy. Nakonec jsem dodělal, aby bot automaticky do vláken přidával všechny moderátory a ne jen mě, protože to tak chtěl Dan, který v klubu moderátora dělá.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Většinu věcí se snažím dělat tak, aby byly &lt;em&gt;idempotent&lt;/em&gt; a aby šetřily provoz na Discord API. Idempotent znamená, že i když to spustím několikrát, výsledek bude stejný. Když vlákno pod představením založí uživatel, tak ho bot rovnou použije a třeba přejmenuje na unifikovaný název. Když nějaká zpráva už existuje a není potřeba ji přidávat, bot se ještě podívá, jestli má patřičný textový obsah a pokud ano, neudělá nic, pokud ne, tak zprávu edituje na požadovaný text. Kód je tedy celkem komplikovaný a už teď počítá se spoustou situací.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vítání členů funguje pro všechny nové členy a v podstatě jsem to ladil rovnou na produkci. S těmi privátními kanály a tipy jsem opatrnější. S Danem jsme se na Pyvu dohodli, že to začnu pomalu pouštět do lidí, kteří zrovna do klubu přicházejí, že to budou moji beta testeři. Až to bude jakž takž fungovat, začnu to pomalu pouštět i do existujících členů.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nakonec jsem ještě připravoval kód onboardingu tak, aby jednotlivé tipy nebyly pouhý text, ale byly to funkce vracející text, které dostávají nějaký kontext (např. objekt se členem, kterému se má tip poslat). Myslel jsem, že bych se s tím do začátku nepatlal, ale nakonec mi přijde, že to bude fakt potřeba, aby tipy byly víc užitečné než otravné a aby byly schopny se zformulovat aspoň trochu na míru situaci, ve které se člen nachází.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teď už chybí „jen“ navrhnout první texty tipů a můžu to spustit. Mám trochu pocit, že se mi to psát nechce a tak programuju co můžu a tím to prokrastinuju.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když už jsem u toho všeho byl, přidal jsem taky kód, který vítá sponzorující firmy i pomocí emoji, ne pouze zprávou.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="debugovani-pycordu"&gt;Debugování pycordu&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#debugovani-pycordu" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Podíval jsem se zase trochu na &lt;a href="https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord/issues/1491"&gt;tenhle problém s pycordem&lt;/a&gt; a zjistil jsem, že nový pycord mi failuje skoro na všech vláknech, ne pouze na nějakých obskurních. Skoro mám dojem, jako by to moc netestovali a vydali kód, který podle mě nemůže fungovat dobře na každém větším discord serveru, který víc používá vlákna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="auto-cancel-na-circleci"&gt;Auto-cancel na CircleCI&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#auto-cancel-na-circleci" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Občas se mi stalo, že jsem víckrát pushnul kód do hlavní větve na GitHubu a každý push spustil build na CircleCI. Ty pak jely v podstatě paralelně, ale nevěděly o sobě. Bohužel to pak znamená, že jeden build si přečte Discord, zanalyzuje jeho obsah a začne tam něco posílat, zatímco ten druhý si stihne přečíst Discord ještě předtím a začne tam posílat to samé podruhé.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Než se budou posílat lidem tipy, chtěl jsem tohle vyřešit. Zjistil jsem, že CircleCI &lt;a href="https://circleci.com/docs/skip-build#scope"&gt;má auto-cancel&lt;/a&gt; a že ho mám dokonce zapnutý, ale mají tam explicitně napsáno, že pro hlavní větev to nefunguje a fungovat nebude ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Což je super, když dělám &lt;em&gt;continuous deployment&lt;/em&gt; a jiné větve téměř nepoužívám.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takže jsem hledal, jestli na to není Orb (předpřipravený krok na CircleCI, který už naprogramoval někdo jiný), ale spíš není. &lt;a href="https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/thinkful/cancel_previous_build_and_wait"&gt;Něco existuje&lt;/a&gt;, ale vypadá to, že to je staré a nepovedlo se mi to použít tak, že by to fungovalo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nakonec jsem si to prostě naprogramoval, nějak jsem to narychlo naprasil přes CircleCI API, ale bylo to celkem frustrující, především kvůli tomu jejich API. Lidi, nevytvářejte frustrující API! Přece když chci zjistit, jestli na stejné větvi nejede už nějaký další build, který bych mohl zrušit, tak bych na to neměl potřebovat dva vnořené cykly s requesty na API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Udělal jsem si z toho task a ten se pouští jako první věc po instalaci projektu. Takže když začne nový build, nainstaluje se vše potřebné a pak se pustí tento skript, který projde běžící buildy na téže větvi a zruší je. Potom tento nejnovější build běží dál.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="marketing"&gt;Marketing&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#marketing" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sešel jsem se s Jakubem Nešetřilem a bylo to fajn. Povídali jsme si jen tak o životě, ale došlo i na moje dilema s marketingem. Odnesl jsem si z toho zajímavé závěry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud mým cílem je vydělat zhruba 40 tisíc měsíčně čistého a tuto metu už jsem skoro splnil, aniž bych nějaký skvělý marketing na sociálních sítích měl, možná bych ho nemusel vůbec dělat. Jeho funkci bych mohl nahradit inbound marketingem na webu a jinými věcmi, které škálují. Mohl bych se soustředit na produkt atd., ale prostě možná není vůbec potřeba, abych se tolik věnoval sociálním sítím, když byznys nejspíš funguje tak či tak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dává mi to smysl hned v několika rovinách. Jednou z nich je to, že svůj byznys jsem od začátku zakládal jako solo podnikatel s tím, že věci, které nedokážu naškálovat nebo automatizovat, prostě dělat nebudu nebo nemůžu. Není možné, abych dlouhodobě dělal &lt;em&gt;sales cally&lt;/em&gt;, ale mohu udělat &lt;em&gt;pricing page&lt;/em&gt; a screencast, kde všechno ukážu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outsourcing je možnost, ale v tom, jak chci podnikat, je to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ColinKeeley/status/1548286804192686081"&gt;poslední možnost, když není zbytí&lt;/a&gt;. Tomuto přístupu bych se neměl zpronevěřovat a měl bych zkusit marketing na sociálních sítích buď aspoň částečně automatizovat, nebo úplně vypustit a nahradit něčím, co udělám jednou a funguje to samo. Například inbound marketing, nebo systém pro to, aby moji členové fungovali jako ambasadoři značky a sami doporučovali klub dál. Protože velká firma se bez sociálních sítí možná neobejde, ale já možná ano, protože mi stačí málo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nechám si to ještě rozležet v hlavě a domluvím si asi stejně i tu schůzku s &lt;a href="https://www.janadolejsova.cz/"&gt;Janou&lt;/a&gt;, ať mám víc názorů a tím i podkladů pro vlastní rozhodování.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kandidatura-za-zelene"&gt;Kandidatura za Zelené&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#kandidatura-za-zelene" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Přišlo mi mailem „pošli prosím jednu větu, která vysvětluje, proč jsi se rozhodl kandidovat“, tak jsem to sepisoval. Jedna věta to nebyla, to neumím, ale něco jsem vyplodil a &lt;a href="https://praha3.zeleni.cz/kandidat/jan-javorek"&gt;je to tady&lt;/a&gt;. Pak jsem si to dal ještě &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/honzajavorek/posts/10159769154357707:0"&gt;na FB&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CgKih9SLhGK/"&gt;na IG&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1549099609041080327"&gt;na Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. Když jsem zatím se Zelenými nezvládl vyrazit do ulic v rámci kampaně, zkouším nahnat hlasy aspoň na internetu - to ostatně umím stejně líp, než rozdávat letáky. Celý text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure figure-blockquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chci ulice, kde se neusmažím horkem, kde v pohodě projedu s kočárkem a kde najdu pítko nebo záchod. Chci přecházet silnici nebo posílat dítě samo do školy a nebát se. Chci nové byty, aby lidé mohli bydlet v Praze a měli většinu věcí za rohem jako já, místo aby dvakrát denně stáli pod mými okny v zácpách. A kandiduji za Zelené na Praze 3, protože chtít nestačí.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zelení byli na Praze 3 v koalici na radnici poslední 4 roky a moc se mi líbí, co tady prosazují. Toto je můj způsob, jak je můžu podpořit víc, než jen hlasem nebo lajkem na FB. Zatím nejsem ani členem strany, kandiduji jako nezávislý. Patnácté nebo kolikáté místo na kandidátce samozřejmě znamená, že nemám reálnou šanci být někam zvolen, ale budu rád, když třeba i díky mě dostanou místní Zelení nějaké hlasy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Čekal jsem, že bude tento &lt;em&gt;coming out&lt;/em&gt; víc polarizující, ale asi mám dobrou bublinu a schytal jsem jen jeden plačící smajlík a jeden rozpačitý komentář, jinak spíš lajky a srdíčka. Převážně od lidí, kteří na Praze 3 samozřejmě nebydlí :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ve středu jsem byl na &lt;a href="https://pyvo.cz/praha-pyvo/"&gt;pražském Pyvu&lt;/a&gt;, které testovalo nový prostor v Hloubětíně.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upgradoval jsem na novější verzi Bootstrapu. Chtělo to pár změn i v SCSS kódu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Udělil jsem jedno stipendium na roční členství v klubu. Vzápětí přišla další žádost, ale tu jsem ještě neměl čas pročíst.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domlouval jsem přednášku v klubu. Zase až na září, přes léto nikdo nic dělat nechce ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Mě to nevadí, aspoň mám klid na práci. Členové zatím neprotestují, podle mě jsou taky někde na dovolené.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domlouval jsem si cally s firmama na další týdny a uvědomil jsem si, že i v této oblasti &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ColinKeeley/status/1548286796441694210"&gt;bych chtěl být víc jako Levels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vydal jsem Páji nový díl &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/podcast/"&gt;podcastu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sociální sítě jsem tento týden dost ignoroval.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Klub, maily, a tak dále. Ale popravdě jsem administrativu tento týden spíš zanedbával.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 7 dní od 16.7. do 22.7. jsem naběhal 10 km, při procházkách nachodil 8 km, na túrách nachodil 9 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 10 hodin a zdolal při tom 27 kilometrů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aktuální finanční výsledky, návštěvnost a další čísla k JG &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;mám přímo na webu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tři věci, které bych chtěl zvládnout udělat příště:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Připravit první verzi zpráv pro onboarding a pustit je do první testovací skupiny lidí.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zpracovat poznámky z hovoru s mentorem a prodiskutovat je s ostatními mentory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Propagovat nový díl podcastu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus:&lt;/strong&gt; Doplánovat si pořádnou dovolenou.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pokud byste čistě náhodou měli dojem, že jste oproti mě za uplynulý týden vůbec nic nestihli, tak mám pro vás skvělou zprávu! V klidu se na ten dojem &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/neni-to-zavod/"&gt;můžete vykašlat&lt;/a&gt;. Není zač!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pycord, tedy Python knihovna na interakci s Discordem, vydala novou verzi. Po mnoha &lt;em&gt;release candidates&lt;/em&gt; vydali konečně v2. Chtěl jsem hned upgradovat, ale zjistil jsem, že nová verze konzistentně selhává ve stahování a analýze obsahu klubu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Založil jsem &lt;a href="https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord/issues/1491"&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; a několik následujících dní jsem postupně zkoušel debugovat, proč to padá. Zabralo mi to ohromné množství času, ale měl jsem zrovna na takovou detektivku celkem náladu a říkal jsem si, že discord.py a pycord mi ušetřily svou existencí už tak milion hodin, takže proč nějakou lásku nevrátit zpět.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicméně zatím se mi nepovedlo problém rozřešit a vypadá to, že jde o nějaký hodně specifický problém, takže ani nenaskakuje moc dalších lidí na to, aby se jím zabývalo. Zbývá ještě několik věcí, které bych mohl udělat, abych zjistil, co se přesně děje, ale nějak bych už rád dělal zase něco jiného, takže jsem upgrade zatím odložil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="onboarding"&gt;Onboarding&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#onboarding" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nejdřív jsem opravil zjevný bug v prototypu onboardingu z minulého týdne. Bot posílal zprávy všechny najednou a ne každý den jednu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potom jsem se podíval do Trella a snažil se udělat si pořádek v kartičkách, které se onboardingem nějak zabývají. Bylo toho hodně a dalo mi dost mentální práce vytvořit si z toho v hlavě nějakou mapu a uspořádat si myšlenky. Je to celé mnohem větší:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plynulá cesta člověka na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/club/"&gt;stránce /club/&lt;/a&gt; až do Discordu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://junior.guru/faq/"&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tipy ohledně Discordu samotného, ohledně klubu, ohledně JG webu a všech funkcí JG&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uspořádání klubu, kanál s pravidly, okýnko s pravidly, uvítací texty a popisky na Discordu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stránka o tom, jak se správně ptát a jak správně debugovat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mnohé další. Trello jsem si přesypal několikrát na různé hromádky, než se mi z toho začalo něco rýsovat. Rozhodl jsem se, že půjdu zevnitř ven - nejdříve vylepším klub jako takový a uživatelskou experience v něm. Poté vylepším jak se lidé dostávají do klubu. Potom vylepším stránku o klubu. Potom hlavní stránku JG a SEO a &lt;em&gt;inbound&lt;/em&gt; marketing atd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myslím si, že je nutné to udělat v tomto pořadí, protože naopak by to vedlo k tomu, že víc lidí dokážu dostat do klubu, ale oni odpadnou, protože tam bude hrozná uživatelská zkušenost. Zlepšením zkušenosti si zachovám co nejvíc lidí z těch, kteří už teď jsou schopni do klubu přicházet a když to bude vyřešené, mohu uvolňovat &lt;em&gt;funnel&lt;/em&gt; ve vyšších polohách a lít do něj víc a víc lidí.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Udělal jsem postupně tyto věci:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prošel jsem si jak vypadá onboarding do &lt;a href="https://scrimba.com/"&gt;Scrimba&lt;/a&gt;, pro inspiraci.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prošel jsem si s úplně novým fake uživatelem onboarding do klubu od objednávky po psaní do kanálů a dělal jsem si poznámky. Bylo to příšerné. Vůbec nechápu, že je někdo schopen se do klubu probojovat, já bych to asi pětkrát vzdal. Většinu z těchto věcí ale budu, jak jsem psal už výše, opravovat spíš později.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Podíval jsem se, &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/715325990"&gt;jak ještě mohu upravovat vzhled&lt;/a&gt; objednávkové stránky atd.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Všiml jsem si, že kanál na oznámení ve Scrimba nemají jako typický Discordí &lt;em&gt;news channel&lt;/em&gt;. Pokud nevyužívám možnost že by někdo ten můj &lt;em&gt;news channel&lt;/em&gt; odebíral, je to možná lepší jako normální kanál, protože zpráva „odebírej tento kanál na svém serveru“ nemate nové uživatele. Tato zpráva se mi jako adminovi nezobrazuje, takže bez toho, že bych si vyzkoušel klub jako cizí člověk, bych na to vůbec nepřišel. Hned jsem to změnil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Překopal jsem neskutečné množství věcí v klubu tak, abych jej zjednodušil. Sloučil jsem některé kanály, některé archivoval, přejmenoval. Prošel jsem &lt;em&gt;topic&lt;/em&gt; zprávy a &lt;em&gt;pinned&lt;/em&gt; příspěvky ve všech kanálech a buď je přepsal, nebo změnil, atd. Zkoušel jsem, jestli by kanály nebyly přehlednější s emojis na začátku, jak jsem to viděl na jiných Discordech (nebyly). Zjednodušil jsem kategorie, do kterých se kanály dělí. To vše jsem udělal proto, abych měl méně práce s onboardingem. Pokud bude klub sám o sobě jednodušší, bude méně věcí na vysvětlování. Opět mě v tom trochu inspirovala Scrimba, kde jsou tisíce lidí a přesto je tam jen pár kanálů. Zas nemohu kopírovat 1:1, protože oni jsou víc orientovaní na kurzy, kdežto já provozuju víc diskuzní Discord a proto je přece jen adekvátní, že mám víc kanálů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pak jsem i trochu programoval. Uvědomil jsem si, že je sice milé, jak jsem prototyp onboardingu naprasil nejrychlejším možným způsobem, ale že už teď se v tom nevyznám a přitom to ještě nic pořádně neumí. Samý if/else a spousta možností, co se může stát, v tom zaprasené async/await se změnami na Discordu jako mazání nebo vytváření kanálů. To si říkalo o velký špatný.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takže jsem to rozdělil. Vždy jsem udělal funkci, která vezme data a na základě nich vrátí datové struktury v podstatě s instrukcemi o tom, co se má provést. Tyto funkce lze skvěle testovat a také jsem je co nejvíc otestoval. Na vstupu různé situace, které se mohou v kanálu se zprávami objevit, na výstupu co by měl můj skript udělat. Když objevím bug nebo situaci, se kterou jsem původně nepočítal, nebo budu chtít přidat funkčnost, prostě si přidám &lt;em&gt;test cases&lt;/em&gt; a bude. Kód, který pak sahá přímo na Discord je už relativně primitivní a testovat ho nemusím, nebo spíš prostě nebudu. Bere instrukce a provádí je, kontrola že funguje správně jde celkem dobře dělat i jen okem. Sice mi to zabralo den a půl, ale hodně mi to pomohlo kód připravit na to, abych do něj něco dalšího přidával a jsem rád, že jsem to udělal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Z grafů o příchodech a odchodech na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;stránce s čísly&lt;/a&gt; jsem odmazal poslední měsíc, protože v něm stejně byly nesmysly a jen mi to ustřelovalo měřítko osy Y a kazilo čitelnost předchozích měsíců.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zabýval jsem se odpovídáním na různé věci na Pyvec Slacku, kde se mi toho za zhruba týden, co jsem tam nebyl, trochu nahromadilo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zavolal jsem si s mentorem z Mews, který se už přes rok nabízí v klubu na 1:1 konzultace. Byl z toho dvouhodinový hovor, ze kterého si odnáším spoustu poznámek a poznatků.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sociální sítě:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V klubu se toho moc neděje, asi léto. Mailů jsem měl přes 30, většinu jsem vyřešil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 7 dní od 9.7. do 15.7. jsem naběhal 8 km, při procházkách nachodil 11 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 6 hodin a zdolal při tom 19 kilometrů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aktuální finanční výsledky, návštěvnost a další čísla k JG &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;mám přímo na webu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ceník jsem opět nevymyslel a ještě je na to snad čas, tak to nechám zatím být. Seznam co zrušit, delegovat, nebo automatizovat jsem taky nepřeměnil na konkrétní úkoly, udělám někdy později. Stres ze zátěže režií ustal s tím, jak všichni odjeli na dovolenou.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Budu se teď soutředit na onboarding, když už jsem ho rozdělal. Takže tři věci, které bych chtěl zvládnout udělat příště:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doprogramovat základní funkčnost onboardingu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Připravit první verzi zpráv pro onboarding a pustit je do první testovací skupiny lidí.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zpracovat poznámky z hovoru s mentorem a prodiskutovat je s ostatními mentory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus:&lt;/strong&gt; Doplánovat si pořádnou dovolenou.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-co-vy"&gt;A co vy?&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#a-co-vy" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Na tento týden jsme odjeli ke Zlínu k babičce, což nazývám dovolenou, protože tím vzniká nepoměr 3 dospělí na 1 batole v místě, kde je bazének, houpačka, zvířátka, pískoviště, apod. Tím ale velmi erodovala moje pracovní morálka. Prioritizoval jsem zážitky s rodinou a k práci jsem si sedl, jen když nebyl jiný program. Za jedny z největších úspěchů tedy považuji třeba postavení hradu z písku nebo zaběhnutí 20 km přes kus Zlínského kraje. Hrad si můžete ještě chvilku prohlédnout &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/honza.javorek/"&gt;ve storíčku&lt;/a&gt;, jsem líný si fotku posílat na počítač a dávat do článku.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="roboticky-onboarding"&gt;Robotický onboarding&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#roboticky-onboarding" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Během těch pár hodin, které jsem si vyhradil na programování, jsem vytvořil základní funkčnost robotického onboardingu nových členů do klubu. Můj Discord bot nyní dokáže projít všechny členy a vytvořit jim soukromý kanál, do něhož má přístup jen tento člen, robot a moderátoři. Do tohoto kanálu poté bot dokáže postupně posílat nějaké přednastavené zprávy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chtěl jsem, aby robot uměl kanál smazat, pokud už člověk v klubu není. Kanál je k osobě vždy přiřazen skrze ID, které si ukládám do topicu kanálu. Bot topic parsuje a podle ID zjistí, čí kanál to je. Přišlo mi to lepší, než kdyby musel zkoumat oprávnění v kanálu a dovozovat si z toho, který člen je tam navíc kromě moderátorů a robota. Také mi to přišlo spolehlivější, než to dělat vyloženě jen podle názvu kanálu (může být víc členů se zhruba stejným jménem). Ještě mě napadlo, že by bot neměl kanál mazat hned, ale až třeba po měsíci, protože lidem třeba vyprší karta a tak, takže aby neztratili hned historii a nerestartoval se onboarding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zprávy v kanálu se řídí tím, že začínají nějakým emoji. Bot najde poslední svou zprávu v kanálu, která začíná na určité emoji a podle toho ví, která to je. Žádné dvě onboarding zprávy s tipy nesmí tím pádem mít stejné emoji. Když časem upravím text pro určitou zprávu, umí bot původní zprávu editovat. Ještě jsem uvažoval, že by mohl pak dodat ještě reply do kanálu, že ji upravil, pokud je to už delší doba, ale to je bonus. Taky by se zprávy měly posílat s nějakým časovým odstupem, třeba každý den jedna. Teď se tam zatím nasolí všechny najednou.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To celé vyvíjím jako continuous delivery, takže je to už na produkci. Mám to ale zatím omezeno pouze na jednoho testovacího uživatele, takže členové to nevidí. Teď bych měl jednak dodělat to postupné posílání, jednak bych měl hlavně vymyslet obsah těch tipů, tak aby dával největší smysl. Už teď vím, že se s tím budu moc patlat. Musím si opakovat, že lepší mít něco trochu blbého hned a iterovat a vylepšovat to už se zpětnou vazbou od lidí, než abych to ladil k dokonalosti někde bokem. Ideálně kdyby se to celé spustilo, klidně i jen s třemi úvodními zprávami, třeba už příští týden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vymýšlel jsem rodinnou dovolenou na září. Zjistil jsem, že neumím vymýšlet rodinné dovolené. Ještě tomu dám pár pokusů a pak jdu pro katalog Čedoku.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vypadá to, že opravili &lt;a href="https://github.com/instantpage/instant.page/issues/72"&gt;problémy&lt;/a&gt; v instant.page, tak jsem to na JG upgradoval na nejnovější verzi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strašně jsem si užil Silverstone (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM6ren2tPU8"&gt;sestřih&lt;/a&gt;), což byl snad nejlepší závod, jaký jsem kdy v F1 viděl. Nutno podotknout, že jsem F1 posledních 10 nebo 15 let nesledoval a to předtím si pamatuju jen dost matně :D&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sociální sítě jsem prokrastinoval, protože jsem na ně neměl náladu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Klub, maily, zprávy na LinkedIn, a tak dále. Klub i maily jsem prošel několikrát a bylo hodně co řešit. Ve skutečnosti mi to zabralo velký díl času, který jsem během uplynulého týdne věnoval práci. V klubu jsem si například dal tu práci napsat feedback hned na tři CVčka.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pokročil jsem v domluvení konzultace s &lt;a href="https://www.janadolejsova.cz/"&gt;Janou Dolejšovou&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V klubu jsem doplnil popisek kanálu pro mentoring a upravil návod, jak se zakládají vlákna v poradně, protože byl špatně a nikomu kromě mě nefungoval.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domluvil jsem prodloužení partnerství s &lt;a href="https://www.inuits.eu/"&gt;Inuits&lt;/a&gt; a poslal fakturu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odebral jsem kód na slevu na lístky na WebExpo, který jsem před konferencí schoval do různých částí kódu JG webovek.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 7 dní od 2.7. do 8.7. jsem naběhal 34 km, při procházkách nachodil 18 km, ujel na kole 9 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 16 hodin a zdolal při tom 61 kilometrů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aktuální finanční výsledky, návštěvnost a další čísla k JG &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;mám přímo na webu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tři věci, které bych chtěl zvládnout udělat příště:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navrhnout náplň onboardingu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vymyslet nový ceník.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seznam co zrušit, delegovat, nebo automatizovat přeměnit na konkrétní úkoly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus:&lt;/strong&gt; Doplánovat si pořádnou dovolenou.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-co-vy"&gt;A co vy?&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#a-co-vy" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud byste čistě náhodou měli dojem, že jste oproti mě za uplynulý týden vůbec nic nestihli, tak mám pro vás skvělou zprávu! V klidu se na ten dojem &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/neni-to-zavod/"&gt;můžete vykašlat&lt;/a&gt;. Není zač!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="co-me-zaujalo"&gt;Co mě zaujalo&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#co-me-zaujalo" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když si něco přečtu nebo poslechnu a líbí se mi to, &lt;a href="https://getpocket.com/@honzajavorek"&gt;sdílím to na Pocketu&lt;/a&gt;. Od posledních poznámek jsem sdílel toto:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://seznam-zpravy.u.mailkit.eu/mc/VVQIVPEI/IFFILXQQDLFARYLJIY/CQMCWMIUIPV"&gt;Pod čarou : Každý příběh je lež. Nepřehánějme to s jejich vyprávěním.&lt;/a&gt; si záměrně zamlčujeme řadu důležitých věcí. A možná ještě horším důsledkem je, že se kvůli důrazu na příběhy navzájem velmi podceňujeme a hovoříme spolu jako s malými dětmi.“&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.heroine.cz/zena-a-svet/8966-na-zada-batoh-a-jde-se-matka-ctyr-deti-radi-jak-cestovat-s-detmi-bez-auta-hlavni-je-trpelivost-a-nelpet-na-planech"&gt;Na záda batoh a jde se. Matka čtyř dětí radí, jak cestovat s dětmi bez auta. Hlavní je trpělivost a nelpět na plánech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drsné.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Není to vše, co jsem přečetl, slyšel nebo viděl, ale jen zlomek, který mě zaujal. K vygenerování tohoto seznamu jsem použil vlastní knihovnu &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/pocket-recommendations/"&gt;pocket-recommendations&lt;/a&gt;. Věci, které jsem sdílel v den psaní minulých poznámek, se opakují i v těch dalších a je to záměr, ne chyba.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category><category term="týdenní poznámky"></category><category term="junior.guru"></category></entry><entry><title>Týdenní poznámky #95: Opravy čísel a přemýšlení</title><link href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/tydenni-poznamky-95-opravy-cisel-a-premysleni/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-07-01T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2022-07-01T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Honza Javorek</name></author><id>tag:honzajavorek.cz,2022-07-01:/blog/tydenni-poznamky-95-opravy-cisel-a-premysleni/</id><summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utekl zase nějaký ten týden (25.6. — 1.7.) a tak &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/tydenni-poznamky-94-premysleni-psani-a-cisteni/"&gt;stejně jako minule&lt;/a&gt; sepisuji, co jsem dělal a co zajímavého jsem se naučil.

&lt;h2 id="opravovani-chyb-v-grafech"&gt;Opravování chyb v grafech&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#opravovani-chyb-v-grafech" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snažil jsem se opravit různé chyby na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;stránce s grafy&lt;/a&gt;. Neseděl mi počet členů z API a počet členů na Discordu. Nelíbilo se mi, že poslední měsíc vždy vypadal nějak divně. Na něco jsem přišel, něco jsem spíš jenom pochopil proč tak je a vysvětlení jsem si dopsal do textu u grafu. Rozdělil jsem grafy s příchody a odchody. Přidal jsem do grafů procentuální &lt;em&gt;churn&lt;/em&gt;, konečně. Opravil jsem graf s délkou setrvání v klubu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zjistil jsem, že se mi nezapočítávají lidi, kteří jsou na dárkovém předplatném (taková ta vánoční akce). Vzhledem k tomu, že s těmito dárky do budoucna nepočítám, rozhodl jsem se místo debugování tyto zhruba tři lidi v Memberful konvertovat na standardní roční členství a to dárkové jsem smazal ¯\_(ツ)_/¯&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vypomoc-na-marketing"&gt;Výpomoc na marketing&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#vypomoc-na-marketing" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/vypomoc-na-socialni-site/"&gt;Inzerát na marketingovou výpomoc&lt;/a&gt; jsem nad rámec tohoto blogu nebo klubu záměrně nikde nepropagoval. Ozvalo se mi několik lidí. Pár lidí mi někoho doporučilo a já se pokusil ty doporučené lidi kontaktovat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nakonec jsem to ale spíš pozastavil, protože inzerát jsem sice sepsal hezký, ale v důsledku vyvstala spousta otázek, na které si ve skutečnosti neumím odpovědět. Kolik na to mám peněz? Hledám profíka, který bude přicházet s vlastními nápady a řešeními, nebo čistě výpomoc, kterou třeba i zaučím? Jak důležitý je pro mě marketing na sociálních sítích? Za jakým účelem ho dělám a jak bych popsal „úspěch“ této své činnosti?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ve výsledku nejenže neumím vybrat člověka, který by zaplácl mou nechuť dělat dál marketing na sociálních sítích sám, ale spadla na mě i tíha všech otázek výše a nechuť je řešit. Pak někde někdo nasdílel &lt;a href="https://slideslive.com/webexpo/webexpo-2022"&gt;videa z letošního WebExpa&lt;/a&gt; a já tam zahlédl přednášku &lt;a href="https://slideslive.com/38984420/outsourcing-your-marketing-do-your-homework-first"&gt;Outsourcing Your Marketing? Do Your Homework First&lt;/a&gt; od Jany Dolejšové. Podíval jsem se na &lt;a href="https://www.janadolejsova.cz/"&gt;její web&lt;/a&gt; a uvědomil jsem si, že to, co nabízí, je nejspíš přesně něco, co potřebuju. Chci jednorázovou konzultaci od profíka, která by mi pomohla uspořádat si myšlenky, nastavit strategii, případně i vybrat člověka na výpomoc nebo změnit, jak to celé dělám.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aktuálně pracuji na tom, abych taková konzultace proběhla a pak se uvidí. Do té doby budu stále rád za tipy na výpomoc, ale samotné „výběrové řízení“ jsem tímto ze své strany pozastavil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vykop-onboardingu"&gt;Výkop onboardingu&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#vykop-onboardingu" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Začal jsem realizovat onboarding nových členů v klubu. Vytvořil jsem skript, který umí vyrobit nový privátní kanál na Discordu a dát do něj oprávnění určitým rolím nebo lidem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Předtím jsem se ještě podíval na skript, který analyzuje obsah Discordu. Zefektivnil jsem jeho průběh a místo 4.5min teď trvá 3.7min. Udělal jsem to tak, že se už klub neanalyzuje v rámci celé své historie, ale jen za poslední rok. Některé kanály navíc nově přeskakuji úplně, některé jsem omezil na pouhý měsíc zpět. Tím by se také mělo zabránit narůstání délky trvání tohoto skriptu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="co-muzu-zrusit"&gt;Co můžu zrušit&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#co-muzu-zrusit" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokračoval jsem s přemýšlením, co můžu do budoucna zefektivnit, zrušit, nebo dělat jednodušeji a jinak. Už minule jsem psal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nebudu už vzdělávacím agenturám nabízet program pro jejich studenty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nejsem zatím přesvědčen o tom, že má smysl dělat nějaké velkolepé plány kolem stipendia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Omezím režii kolem dobrovolných příspěvků&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zkusím delegovat nějakou práci na marketingu na sociálních sítích&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dále mě napadlo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zrušit outbound marketing kromě Q&amp;amp;A pro komunity a podcastů, kde je dobrý poměr cena/výkon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zjednodušit ceník pro firmy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mít spolupráce s firmami a komunitami jasně zabalené jako balíčky, které jsou pro všechny stejné a mají jasné mantinely a není kolem nich žádná „speciální“ komunikace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Možná zavést &lt;em&gt;free plan&lt;/em&gt; pro firmy, které nechtějí členství, ale nabízí nějaký &lt;em&gt;barter&lt;/em&gt; (sleva pro klub, marketing) a dát tomu opět jasné podmínky a mantinely&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatizovat některé maily firmám&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Natočit screencast jako demo toho, jak vypadá klub a co se v něm dá dělat, což zjednoduší nebo zruší „sales cally“&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Umět na většinu mailů odpovědět odkazem někam do FAQ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zrušit spreadsheet, kde mám seznam členů klubu - důvody, proč jej mám, lze myslím už plně řešit přímo přes admina Memberful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domlouvám se s jedním mentorem, že si zavoláme a řekne mi feedback z mentorování v klubu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uzavřeli jsme spolupráci s Engetem. Bude to mít více úrovní, ale pomůžu jim s propagací jedné věci a společně připravíme průzkum mezi juniory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Řešil jsem faktury s několika dalšími firmami.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domlouval jsem přednášku v klubu od Codeac, na září.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Byl jsem na dentální hygieně.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Koukal jsem se na možnosti půjčení vozíku na dítě za kolo (chariot).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uměle jsem prodloužil členství hned několika firem až do 1.9., ať s nimi nemusím komunikovat teď v létě, kdy jsou všichni na dovolené, a ať mám přes léto trochu klid na práci. Navíc od září chci mít už i jiný ceník.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přidal jsem se do &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/karieroviporadci/"&gt;skupiny pro kariérové poradce&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Řešil jsem stipendium pro jednu členku.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sepsali jsme spolu s Jakubem z Processandu &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/dbbb7bf406b3c33aeba36cae817919d44bfb368a08fb1b4899dba130/"&gt;inzerát&lt;/a&gt;. Ještě na ten text sbírám feedback i v klubu mezi juniory, ale už jsme to dali ven, ladit to můžeme za pochodu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sešel jsem se s &lt;a href="https://lucie.vaclavkova.com/"&gt;Lucií Václavkovou&lt;/a&gt; a povídali jsme si o svých byznysech.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na zanedbanou &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/events/"&gt;stránku s přednáškami&lt;/a&gt; jsem aspoň doplnil jména přednášejících a opravil jeden odkaz.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jeli jsme do zookoutku v Milíčově.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zvýšil jsem svou základní poslechovou rychlost pro většinu podcastů na 2,5x&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vyzvedl jsem si oblek v čistírně&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sociální sítě: Propagoval jsem &lt;a href="https://www.programhrovani.cz/1843229/10874390-dev-stories-4-paja-fronkova-z-pyladies-do-irska-a-zase-zpatky"&gt;podcast s Pájou&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Klub, maily, a tak dále.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 7 dní od 25.6. do 1.7. jsem naběhal 11 km, při procházkách nachodil 7 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 6 hodin a zdolal při tom 18 kilometrů.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tři věci, které bych chtěl zvládnout udělat příště:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Programovat onboarding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vymyslet nový ceník.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poslední poznámky jsem psal v pondělí, ale chtěl bych najet na klasický páteční rytmus, takže dnes píšu další. Snad to bude díky tomu aspoň krátké.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="text-v-hlasovych-kanalech-a-upgrade-pycordu"&gt;Text v hlasových kanálech a upgrade PyCordu&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#text-v-hlasovych-kanalech-a-upgrade-pycordu" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discord zavedl &lt;a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4412085582359"&gt;textový chat v hlasových kanálech&lt;/a&gt;. V klubu jsem tedy zrušil kanál, který to suploval a změnil bota, aby používal novinku, například při ohlašování nadcházející přednášky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zjistil jsem, že abych to mohl udělat, musím upgradovat knihovnu py-cord, jejíž upgrade jsem dlouhodobě prokrastinoval, protože novější verze všechno rozbila. Pustil jsem se tedy do toho a za pár minut odhalil podle changelogů příčinu. Stačilo nastavit nějaké nové oprávnění (&lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;) pro čtení obsahu zpráv na Discordu a vše začalo zase fungovat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="premysleni"&gt;Přemýšlení&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#premysleni" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investorka (manželka) se mě zeptala, co plánuji dělat tento týden. Rozjel jsem nekonečný monolog, u kterého jsem si uspořádal myšlenky a rozhodl o některých věcech. Investorka byla potěšena, že mi pomohla, ač to bylo metodou &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging"&gt;gumové kachničky&lt;/a&gt;. Cílem je především zjednodušení byznysu, abych nedělal deset věcí tak trochu, ale dvě nebo tři, ale pořádně.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nebudu už vzdělávacím agenturám nabízet program pro jejich studenty, kdy je na 3 měsíce posílají do klubu a proplácejí jim vstup. Dokud o to bude mít zájem SDA, budu jim to poskytovat a nebudu na to sahat, ale nedává mi smysl nabízet to dalším, protože si na základě průzkumu myslím, že hodnotu, kterou dodává klub, pokrývají ostatní agentury jinak. Měl to být produkt pro víc firem, nakonec jej využívá jediná (i když jiná, než která jej vymyslela). Přináší to lidi do klubu a peníze, ale je to &lt;em&gt;distraction&lt;/em&gt; od toho hlavního, co bych měl dělat. Už teď to je hodně specialit v procesech i v kódu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nejsem zatím přesvědčen o tom, že má smysl dělat nějaké velkolepé plány kolem stipendia. Nechám prostě vystavený formulář a když tam spadne někdo zajímavý, ozvu se Janovi z Mews a uvidíme, zda nám bude dávat smysl člověka podpořit i nějak víc. Zatím nebudu hledat víc firem, které by do tohoto se mnou šly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Omezím režii kolem dobrovolných příspěvků. Už delší dobu je nepropaguji, protože chci, aby mi peníze chodily primárně skrze moje podnikání, ne skrze Patreon a GitHub Sponsors. Bez dobrovolných přispěvatelů by dnes JG nejspíš neexistovalo, ale teď je čas se postavit na vlastní nohy. Rušit profily nebudu, bránit lidem podporovat mě nebudu, ale osekám vše kolem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zkusím delegovat nějakou práci na marketingu na sociálních sítích.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toto přemýšlení nepovažuji za dokončené, naopak mám dojem, že jsem skoro ještě nezačal :) Primárním cílem je opravdu zjednodušit byznys tak, aby se šlo snadno soustředit na jednu dvě věci a vedle toho se zabývat samotným tvořením, tedy psaním příručky a programováním robota a dalších věcí.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="psani"&gt;Psaní&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#psani" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Napsal jsem &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/vypomoc-na-socialni-site/"&gt;inzerát na marketingovou výpomoc&lt;/a&gt;, kterou začínám hledat. Budu rád, když mi někoho doporučíte, nebo se sami ozvete, pokud vás to zaujme.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Společně s datovým analytikem z &lt;a href="https://www.processand.com/"&gt;Processand&lt;/a&gt; jsem připravoval jejich inzerát pro juniory na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/"&gt;junior.guru/jobs&lt;/a&gt;. Ještě jsme jej nepublikovali, možná v pondělí.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na sociálních sítích jsem propagoval &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/podcast/"&gt;nový díl podcastu s Markétou Willis&lt;/a&gt;. Protože Markéta lektoruje v Czechitas, nacpal jsem to i do všech FB skupin Czechitas. Bál jsem se, že mi to pomažou, ale místo toho se mi ozvala adminka ostravské skupiny, o které jsem ani nevěděl, jestli bych to tam nedal taky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Klub, maily, a tak dále. Komunikoval jsem hlavně ohledně stipendií a firemních členství.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domlouval jsem se s &lt;a href="https://www.codeac.io/"&gt;Codeac&lt;/a&gt; na tom, jak si můžeme vzájemně pomoci. Jeden z nápadů je, že by mohl jejich nástroj pomoci s automatickým připomínkováním projektů juniorů, např. že se necommitují tokeny do Gitu, že se nedělá to a tamto.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cisteni"&gt;Čištění&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#cisteni" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Začal jsem čistit historické členy v klubu, kteří tam jsou od samého začátku, ale následně už nijak nekomunikovali a nepovedlo se mi je převést na účty v Memberful. To mi dlouhodobě komplikuje kód, statistiky, atd. Vyházel jsem všechny až na &lt;a href="https://www.vzhurudolu.cz/"&gt;Martina&lt;/a&gt;, kterému pak musím ještě napsat a ukecat ho, aby se mi doklikal do Memberful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zrušil jsem studentské kupóny, které původně měly být pro jednu vzdělávací agenturu, ale která je nakonec nikdy nevyužila a nevyužije.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Udělal jsem pořádek ve studentech &lt;a href="https://coreskill.tech/"&gt;CoreSkillu&lt;/a&gt;, kteří byli z historických důvodů na všelijakých kupónech a byl v tom dost zmatek.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pár měsíců zpět jsem myslel, že jak firmy budou prodlužovat členství, budu další roky řešit pomocí dalších kupónů. Podle toho jsem začal vydávat obskurně komplikovaně skládané kupóny, ve kterých bylo dokonce i číslo faktury. Pak jsem ale přišel na to, že mohu botem prodlužovat lidem délku členství a mohou přitom zůstat na předplatném, které už mají. To vše extrémně zjednodušuje. Nyní jsem celou mechaniku se složitými kupóny smazal z kódu a všechny složité kupóny zjednodušil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smazal jsem ze systému všechny neaktivní slevové kupóny.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smazal jsem vánoční stránku s dárkovým členstvím v klubu. Smazal jsem animaci padajícího sněhu. Tolik práce to bylo a přineslo to nakonec 3 členství v klubu. Trvalo mi půl roku, než jsem se dokázal vypořádat s tím, že to nejlepší, co mohu v této věci udělat, je smazat to z kódu a už takové blbiny nikdy nedělat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promazal jsem staré archivované kanály v klubu. Většina z nich tam byla rok pouze pro čtení a jejich hodnota byla už nulová.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smazal jsem stránku &lt;code&gt;/donate/&lt;/code&gt; a zatím přesměroval na &lt;code&gt;/open/&lt;/code&gt;. Mám nějaký nápad, jak by se to dalo jednou udělat lépe, ale teď jsem chtěl hlavně odstranit dávno neaktuální prosbu o dobrovolné příspěvky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Překopal jsem svoje profily na GitHub Sponsors a Patreonu. Původní texty jsem si &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/honzajavorek/ed2036751a65c6e6820e4c813b9d950d"&gt;uložil sem&lt;/a&gt;. Oba profily jsem předělal do angličtiny a napsal jsem tam jednotný text, kde vysvětluji co zhruba teď dělám a že nikomu nebudu bránit mě podporovat, ale že si mohou taky normálně koupit členství v &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/club/"&gt;klubu&lt;/a&gt;. Výsledek bude zhruba stejný, ale z peněz se strhne méně poplatků. U jednotlivých částek jsem dal jasně najevo, že za to podporující nic na oplátku nedostává. Nikdo totiž nikdy nic reálně nechtěl realizovat ani z těch „výhod“, které jsem tam doteď měl.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Členům, kteří už mě nepodporují ani na GitHub Sponsors ani na Patreonu jsem odebral kupón, který jim zajišťuje členství v klubu zdarma. Většina z nich jej stejně nevyužívala a členství měla jen nominálně. Nepotřebuji nafukovat čísla mrtvými dušemi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nahrál jsem &lt;a href="https://speakerdeck.com/honzajavorek/we-are-the-robots"&gt;slajdy ze své páteční přednášky na SpeakerDeck&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domluvil jsem se s &lt;a href="https://www.vzhurudolu.cz/"&gt;Martinem&lt;/a&gt;, jak budeme distribuovat výtisky jeho nové knihy členům klubu. Mohu rozdat pět knih. Teď už jen vymyslet, jak to udělám. Přijde mi asi škoda to zase nějak náhodně losovat, chtělo by to nějakou reálnou soutěž nebo to použít jako cenu za něco, no ještě uvidím.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na základě předchozích poznámek mi bylo doporučeno &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;amp;v=0DyWG1JiDYk"&gt;toto video&lt;/a&gt; na protahování rukou. Zkusil jsem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ozval se mi starý kamarád z dalekých krajů, že je zrovna v Praze. Vzal jsem si den volno a strávil s ním pěkné odpoledne.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Narazil jsem článek o &lt;a href="https://sive.rs/1s"&gt;jednoduchém triku, jak psát úderně a stručně&lt;/a&gt;. Třeba ho někdy dočtu a začnu to praktikovat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 4 dní od 21.6. do 24.6. jsem naběhal 10 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 2 hodin a zdolal při tom 10 kilometrů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aktuální finanční výsledky, návštěvnost a další čísla k JG &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;mám přímo na webu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tři věci, které bych chtěl zvládnout udělat příště jsou stejné jako minule, protože jsem žádnou z nich nedokázal dokončit a jsou stále nejdůležitější:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zjistit, co můžu zrušit, delegovat, nebo automatizovat, abych měl víc času na samotné tvoření.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spočítat po čtvrt roce zase domácí finance a vymyslet nový ceník.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Podívat se na inzerát pro Processand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus:&lt;/strong&gt; Vymyslet MVP robotického onboardingu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pokud byste čistě náhodou měli dojem, že jste oproti mě za uplynulý týden vůbec nic nestihli, tak mám pro vás skvělou zprávu! V klidu se na ten dojem &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/neni-to-zavod/"&gt;můžete vykašlat&lt;/a&gt;. Není zač!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Když si něco přečtu nebo poslechnu a líbí se mi to, &lt;a href="https://getpocket.com/@honzajavorek"&gt;sdílím to na Pocketu&lt;/a&gt;. Od posledních poznámek jsem sdílel toto:&lt;/p&gt;

Fotka od &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/@dole777"&gt;dole777&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provozuji &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/"&gt;junior.guru&lt;/a&gt;, což je projekt pro začátečníky v programování, který se nyní skládá hlavně z klubu, příručky, podcastu a pracovních inzerátů. Klub je placená komunita na Discordu a je to to hlavní, co mě živí. Kromě něj je vše zdarma a cílem je, aby to pomohlo co nejvíce lidem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zakládám si na transparentnosti, &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;čísla mám veřejně&lt;/a&gt;. Nechci z toho mít firmu, cílem je provozovat to v jednom člověku a uživit při tom rodinu. Nehledám tedy zaměstnance, ale nezávislého profíka, u kterého mohu poptat služby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="trocha-historie"&gt;Trocha historie&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#trocha-historie" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Od začátku projektu si neplatím žádnou reklamu a spoléhám se na vlastní marketingové aktivity a čistě organický &lt;em&gt;reach&lt;/em&gt;. Jsem samouk a většina mých zkušeností plyne z potřeby před lety propagovat srazy a konference Python programátorů. Když jsem předával zodpovědnost za propagaci &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anezkamll/"&gt;Anežce&lt;/a&gt;, která dnes pracuje v Česko.Digital, sepsal jsem na to &lt;a href="https://docs.pyvec.org/guides/promotion.html"&gt;návod&lt;/a&gt;, který je sice staršího data, ale může sloužit jako nahlédnutí do mé hlavy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Časem jsem došel k tomu, že své osobní profily na sociálních sítích využívám jak pro sdílení detailů svého běžného života, tak pro propagaci věcí kolem junior.guru. Mám &lt;a href="https://trello.com/"&gt;Trello&lt;/a&gt; nástěnku s frontou věcí, které bych rád propagoval a v ideálním případě vždy v pondělí a ve středu posílal na sociální sítě. Buď jde o nějakou novinku na junior.guru, např. nový díl podcastu, nebo o věc, která souvisí s juniory a vůbec přitom nemusí souviset konkrétně s mým podnikáním, např. tematický článek na Guardianu. Vždy si nejdříve napíšu text a pak jej dávám postupně na Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter a Instagram. Platíval jsem si &lt;a href="https://buffer.com/"&gt;Buffer&lt;/a&gt;, ale už vše dělám ručně, abych mohl text upravovat specificky pro každou síť a správně označovat lidi nebo firmy, kterých se týká.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="co-potrebuji-vyresit"&gt;Co potřebuji vyřešit&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#co-potrebuji-vyresit" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poslední dobou se do psaní příspěvků musím už nutit. Sociální sítě mě baví a dovedu si představit občas napsat vlastní příspěvek, ale tento pravidelný režim čím dál víc prokrastinuji a fronta se zajímavostmi se nehýbe. Což je škoda, protože jednak nedochází k propagaci toho, co dělám, jednak se ke mě dostávají zajímavé věci a bylo by fajn je sdílet dál. A ve mě sílí pocit, že se potřebuji už věnovat jiným věcem, než dvakrát dvě hodiny týdně věnovat sociálním sítím.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jak-by-to-fungovalo"&gt;Jak by to fungovalo&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#jak-by-to-fungovalo" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spolupráci bych si představoval tak, že máme Trello nástěnku, kam já dávám kartičky s informacemi o tom, co by bylo dobré propagovat. Bylo by rozlišeno, jestli něco má termín, nebo je jedno, kdy to půjde ven. Občas bych rovnou připravil obrázek, občas bych nastínil, co mě na věci zaujalo a co bych chtěl v příspěvku zdůraznit. Pak by někdo přišel a zpracoval to do příspěvků pro jednotlivé sociální sítě a případně by doplnil chybějící obrázky. Bylo by skvělé, kdyby šlo příspěvky napsat aspoň trochu jako bych je psal já, nějaký ten &lt;em&gt;tone of voice&lt;/em&gt;. Kdyby to bylo nějak technicky možné, dával by to za mě i na ty profily, ale umím si představit i to, že to mám připravené, přečtu si to a případně trochu upravím a následně to na sítě nasázím sám.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moje profily jsou: &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/honzajavorek"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/honzajavorek/"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://instagram.com/honza.javorek/"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. Kromě Twitteru mám všude i „firemní stránky“ přímo pro junior.guru, ale nepoužívám je, protože na nich byl mizerný &lt;em&gt;engagement&lt;/em&gt; a nulový organický &lt;em&gt;reach&lt;/em&gt;, vše jsem přesunul na sebe. Na FB mám ještě &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/junior.guru"&gt;skupinu&lt;/a&gt;, která existovala dřív než klub a teď už je jakoby pouze „pro fanoušky“. Nemám čas ani chuť ji moderovat, takže do ní nemůže psát nikdo jiný než já. Mohl bych ji smazat úplně, ale takhle zůstává ve výsledcích vyhledávání a je tam větší &lt;em&gt;engagement&lt;/em&gt;, než byl na Facebookové stránce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dříve jsem byl programátor v různých firmách, z nichž nejvýznamější bylo &lt;a href="https://byznys.ihned.cz/c1-65593630-oracle-kupuje-za-miliardy-korun-cesky-start-up-apiary-zakladatele-ve-firme-zustavaji"&gt;Apiary&lt;/a&gt;. Přes dekádu se motám kolem české komunity fanoušků programovacího jazyka &lt;a href="https://python.cz/"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jak jde vidět i tady z inzerátu, rád píšu. Tenhle blog píšu 15 let, kromě toho jsem psal pro &lt;a href="https://zdrojak.cz/autori/honza-javorek/"&gt;Zdroják&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://nazory.ihned.cz/c7-66842510-ofofc-cf514314230baa8"&gt;Hospodářky&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.czechcrunch.cz/2020/10/boreni-mytu-a-uzitecne-rady-pro-kazdeho-zacatecnika-honza-javorek-vydava-prirucku-o-hledani-prvni-prace-v-it/"&gt;CzechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;, nebo &lt;a href="https://www.heroine.cz/clanky/autor/70000223-honza-javorek"&gt;Heroine&lt;/a&gt;. V poslední době rád volím Zelené a napsal jsem před loňskými volbami &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/volim-marketing/"&gt;článek&lt;/a&gt;, který jim asi přinesl pár hlasů.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Není zatím potřeba mi dělat komplet správu profilů a například se starat o interakce. Zvládnu sám. Příspěvky z osobního života si taky připravím sám, nejsem Babiš :D Dokonce i pokud by šlo o něco „hlubšího“, co nelze moc dobře napsat bez expertízy v oboru, tak to prostě napíšu. Jde mi akorát o delegování příspěvků, které může napsat kdokoliv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nemám tušení, jak v profesionálním marketingu funguje odměňování, takže to si musíme nějak dohodnout. Zatím junior.guru moc nevydělává, ale jsem připraven za naši spolupráci nějak normálně platit, protože je mi jasné, že pokud toto nezvládnu outsourcovat, nepohnu se dál. Nehledám nejnižší cenu nebo „charitu“, potřebuji seriózního partnera, se kterým to bude odsýpat a za jehož služby s radostí zaplatím, protože mi vyřeší problém a já se budu moci soustředit na &lt;em&gt;core business&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spolupráce, jak jsem ji popsal výše, je jen evoluce mého současného přístupu k sociálním sítím. Pokud si sedneme a bude to fungovat, nechám si pak už ve všem poradit a můžeme celou moji strategii překopat, vylepšit vizuální stránku profilů, apod. Psaní na sítě odbývám, tak tam dávám jen to nejnutnější, ale mám kde brát další témata. Můžeme propagovat nejen mnohem víc věcí pro juniory než teď, ale skrze mé členství ve výboru lidem přibližovat činnost &lt;a href="https://pyvec.org/"&gt;Pyvce&lt;/a&gt;, nebo pomoci &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1534473765597458433"&gt;Zeleným na Praze 3&lt;/a&gt; ve volbách skrze moje jméno na jejich kandidátce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Píšu po dvou týdnech a v pondělí, protože poslední dva pátky jsem byl vždy na konferenci.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="svatba-zanet-slach-a-incident-v-klubu"&gt;Svatba, zánět šlach a incident v klubu&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#svatba-zanet-slach-a-incident-v-klubu" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamarádi měli svatbu kousek za Prahou, tak jsme tam i s miminem vyrazili. V pohodě autobusem, dalo se to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V tutéž dobu se mi začalo silně rozjíždět něco jako zánět šlach v zápěstí. Nevěděl jsem, z čeho přesně to mám. Bolelo mě to při nošení dítěte, při řízení kočárku, i při práci u počítače. Znám hned dva lidi ve svém okolí, kteří tím trpí a dotáhli to až k silným bolestem nebo dlaze, takže jsem se dost bál, co bude dál. Omezil jsem veškerou zátěž a doufal jsem, že přes svatbu to nějak přejde. Ulevilo se mi, ale pak se to vždy zhoršovalo intenzivní prací u počítače, takže jsem vyloučil dítě i kočárek jako možné důvody. U těch mě to už jen bolelo, ale nebyly hlavní příčinou. Budu muset nějak upravit způsob práce. Zatím se zkouším řídit &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkSfcGAxVgU"&gt;tímto videem&lt;/a&gt;. Kdyby nic nepomáhalo, nebudu přeučovat pravou ruku na správné pohyby, ale vyměním trackpad na levou a naučím ji už ty správné pohyby. Zatím to ale zkouším tak, že se snažím položení rukou atd. zvědomit a upravovat to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zpět na svatbu. Přijeli jsme o den dřív, abychom si dali třeba výlet do okolí a užili si ještě ženicha s nevěstou. Bohužel v průběhu dne to v klubu začalo bublat, někdo ventiloval co spíš ventilovat neměl a nebylo mu pomoci. Bylo potřeba moderátorsky zasáhnout a nějak to rozřešit. Takže jsem to řešil jak při cestě na svatbu, tak během zbytku dne. V určitý okamžik jsem inkriminovaný kanál znepřístupnil pro členy a napsal jsem, že to řeším, ale nejdřív se v rámci sebelásky půjdu navečeřet. To byl dobrý tah. Volal jsem si taky s Danem, který v klubu moderuje, abych znal jeho názor. Zodpovědnost za jakékoliv rozhodnutí jsem chtěl vzít jednoznačně na sebe, ale zajímalo mě, co si o něm myslí někdo mimo moji hlavu, abych přece jen neudělal nějakou blbost. Večer jsem napsal několik zpráv, ve kterých jsem vážil každé slovo a „pouklízel“ škody. Všichni zúčastnění řešení přijali a pochopili, dále to neeskalovalo. Místo řádění s ženichem jsem skončil s prací v deset nebo jedenáct večer a šel spát. To jsem si vynahradil druhý den, kdy jsem šel spát asi v pět ráno, takže nakonec dobrý.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kdybych to měl nějak zpětně zhodnotit, nevyšlo to časově nejlíp, ale stát se to někdy muselo a dít se to bude. „Udělal si klub a chodili mu tam lidi“, řekl by fanoušek Cimrmana. Jak správně poznamenal Dan, taky se to mohlo stát, když jsem byl někde 5 dní na kole, to by bylo asi horší. Co se týče postupu, dopadlo to dobře, takže byl asi dobrý. Možná jsem mohl mnohem dřív zasáhnout přes soukromé zprávy, ale nejsem moc přesvědčen, že by to nakonec dopadlo jinak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krizovou komunikaci jsem už mnohokrát řešil v Python komunitě a většinou to mělo dobré výsledky, jednou negativní a jednou neutrální. S touto bilancí jsem klub zakládal a zcela jsem si uvědomoval, že dříve nebo později takovéto momenty přijdou. Je to teď moje práce a &lt;em&gt;core business&lt;/em&gt;, lidi si mě za to &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt; platí, aby se v klubu dalo dejchat a fungovalo to tam profesionálně. Takže nic, co by mě překvapilo a i to načasování mohlo být horší. Ve výsledku jsem hlavně rád, že to neeskalovalo dál.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Je to samozřejmě slabina v tom, jak jsem původně chtěl mít ten byznys navržený. Nechtěl jsem &lt;em&gt;on-call&lt;/em&gt;, ale nakonec ho vlastně mám. Mělo to fungovat tak, abych mohl odjet na dva týdny pryč a nic by se nemohlo stát. Jenže jsem dřív holt nenašel takový byznys model, který by to ze 100 % umožňoval, a teď i kdybych ho měl, nechtěl bych klub rušit. Klub je naprosto zásadní věc, která zapadá do všeho, co dělám a dělat chci, lidem fakt hodně pomáhá, umožňuje mi být v kontaktu s realitou juniorů a krmí příručku tématy. Všechno má své nevýhody a klub mi za tuhle nevýhodu teď rozhodně stojí.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="prednaska-o-c-a-netu"&gt;Přednáška o C# a .NETu&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#prednaska-o-c-a-netu" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/madrvojt"&gt;Vojtou Mádrem&lt;/a&gt; jsme měli domluvenou přednášku v klubu. Doladili jsme detaily a než se odehrála, vrátil jsem se ke svému Trello sloupečku, kde jsem měl nápady na vylepšení streamingu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aktualizoval jsem OBS, čímž se mi otevřela možnost nastavit Apple Hardware Encoder pro video. Měl jsem OBS špatně nainstalované přes moje intelácké Homebrew, ne přes ARMové, kvůli čemuž se mi asi nepozorovaně zaseklo na nějaké starší verzi. &lt;a href="https://www.omnicalculator.com/other/streaming-bitrate"&gt;Vypočítal jsem&lt;/a&gt;, jaké nejlepší video jsem schopen streamovat a pak jsem nastavil menší výstupní formát videa v OBS, který bude dost kvalitní, ale ušetří bitrate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Po přednášce mi přijde, že záznam vytvořený takto nastaveným streamem je dostatečný a nemusím ani shánět lepší internet než 20/5 přes LTE, které mám z lenosti ještě z minulého bytu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tím je snad vyřešen problém s limitem na 25 lidí na video hovory na Discordu. Když je lidí méně, což je většinou, tak se nic neděje. Já nahrávám a zároveň streamuju na YouTube. Kdyby limit lidí nestačil, pošlu ostatním odkaz na tento YouTube stream, kde mohou koukat. Když přednáška skončí, nemusím trávit další čas tím, že bych záznam teprve nahrával na YouTube, záznam už existuje díky live streamu a stačí na něj členům dát hned odkaz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Navíc vzniká prostor pro automatizaci. Kdybych moc chtěl, může robot přes API stream připravit, se všemi správnými popisky a nastavením, a to včetně náhledového obrázku. Kdybych moc chtěl, mohl by tento stream pak už bez mého přičinění oznamovat členům v klubu. To už je celkem výrazná pomoc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Přednáška byla moc fajn i obsahově. Hned jsem zkusil podobnou domluvit o Javě.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="administrativa"&gt;Administrativa&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#administrativa" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V týdnu mezi svatbou a WebExpem jsem se rozhodl netlačit na pilu s prací, aby si mohlo zápěstí odpočinout a nezhoršoval se mi zánět šlach. Zakázal jsem si tedy dělat soustředěnou práci a zkusil jsem se věnovat čistě administrativě.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dostal jsem sice i k hodně starým mailům a úkolům, ale brzy na mě dolehla nekonečnost této práce. Asi jako kdybych chtěl týden v kuse umývat nádobí a prát. Ano, byly to velké kupy a nebylo už příjemné je mít za zády, ale do budoucna to dalším kupám nezabrání, je to nekonečné. Každý poslaný email vygeneruje další tři.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zahájil jsem zprocesování jednoho stipendia na členství v klubu a možná i něco víc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zprocesoval jsem jednorázovou &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/9fd87d569b7fbf4356e07fb71943b9ba01beeb079ea7e5b7cc46163e/"&gt;nabídku práce pro juniory od Timepressu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zprocesoval jsem sponzorství klubu firmou &lt;a href="https://www.ataccama.com/"&gt;Ataccama&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://www.processand.com/"&gt;Processand&lt;/a&gt;. Mailoval jsem si s Mews, Engetem a Inuits. Spolu s Processand bychom měli sepsat inzerát do &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/"&gt;junior.guru/jobs&lt;/a&gt;, to teď stojí na mně.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přidal jsem &lt;em&gt;success story&lt;/em&gt; z robime.it: &lt;a href="https://robime.it/ako-zacat-programovat/"&gt;Príbeh: Ako začať programovať v 28 rokoch?&lt;/a&gt; I když trochu neaktuální. Protagonistu příběhu jsem si přidal na LinkedIn a zjistil, že už má vlastní startup :D&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sociální sítě: sdílel jsem &lt;a href="https://www.programhrovani.cz/1843229/10467773-dev-stories-3-pavel-polcr-z-rekvalifikacniho-kurzu-do-it"&gt;podcast s Pavlem Polcrem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.webexpo.net/"&gt;WebExpo&lt;/a&gt;, a že budu přednášet na &lt;a href="https://www.cbw2022.com/"&gt;CWB2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zašel jsem na poštu pro kód, který mi poslal Seznam, abych ověřil svůj účet v nějaké peněžence Seznamu. Pak mi volala paní, proč jsem si ten účet zřizoval. Řekl jsem jí, že chceme publikovat podcast na podcasty.cz a toto po nás chtěli, tak to dělám, ale vůbec nevím proč. Ujistila mě, že to dělám správně. První mail jsem ze Seznamu dostal 13.1. a už jsem musel podepsat smlouvy, napsat hromadu mailů, jít na poštu, s někým si volat… ale podcast tam stále není ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Jako mě je to dost fuk, spíš je mi Seznamu tak nějak líto.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V klubu se objevily minimálně dvě vyhrocenější debaty, které bylo potřeba celé přečíst, vložit se do nich a uklidnit je. Spolu s incidentem popsaným výše neměly tyto dvě debaty nic společného. Obě ale sdílely jakýsi podobný mlhavý půdorys v tom, co lidi rozdělovalo, ale jsou to věci, které lidi rozdělují všude a odjakživa. Klub je zaměřen i na kariérní otázky, takže hodně z témat přetéká do osobních životů lidí, konkrétních zkušeností, v důsledku i do hodnot, do politiky. Dá se tedy takové debaty očekávat i dál. Jak bude v mých silách být vždy u toho a řešit je, to je otázka. Ale zatím dobrý.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Začali jsme v klubu řešit děti. Původně volnou debatu jsem přesunul do dedikovaného kanálu, jehož cílem bylo řešit otázky jako „jak si najít čas na programování a změnu kariéry při výchově dětí“ nebo „jak učit děti programovat“. Že to skončí velkou debatou na feministickém půdorysu, to mi bylo jasné a sám jsem to podpořil (např. sdílením &lt;a href="https://www.heroine.cz/rodina-a-vychova/8596-zeny-muzou-delat-cokoliv-dokud-nemaji-deti-od-matek-spolecnost-ocekava-hlavne-peci"&gt;tohoto&lt;/a&gt;), protože mě zajímaly reálné, žité zkušenosti lidí a jejich názory, ne teorie a generalizace. Kupodivu diskuze o feminismu nebo &lt;em&gt;pay gap&lt;/em&gt; nevíří v klubu vůbec vášně a vše probíhalo pokojně. Jenže když lidi začali psát, jaké jsou jejich žité zkušenosti, začalo to být velmi rychle poměrně temné. Na jednu stranu mi přijde úžasné, že se lidi v klubu dokážou takhle otevřít, jelikož to znamená, že se tam cítí „mezi svýma” a vnímají to jako bezpečné prostředí, což bylo cílem. Na druhou stranu bych nerad, aby se za chvíli v každém druhém kanále sdílely tipy na psychologickou pomoc. Až si tam trochu sedne prach, zkusím do kanálu dát zase nějaké neutrálnější věci a uvidím, jak se to vyvine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pracoval jsem s Nelou na kapitole do příručky o psychickém zdraví. Dala mi text, který připravila a já se k němu několik týdnů nedostal. Po společně zvoleném termínu jsem se konečně dostal k tomu, abych jej prošel a editoval. Máme to rozdělené tak, že ona ručí za obsah a já za formu. Editování bylo náročné a trvalo mi jeden celý pracovní den, ale když sám píšu kapitolu, není to o moc rychlejší. Tady je dobré, že aspoň ten obsah nemusím řešit - rešeršovat, kompilovat zdroje, citovat, atd.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Povedlo se mi sjednotit účty u jedné členky, kde se to kdysi nějak zamotalo a měla špatně propojený Memberful s Discordem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zavolali jsme si spolu s Janem Meissnerem z Mews s klukem, který dostal naše stipendium a snažili se mu předat motivaci a dobrou náladu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přišla mi notifikace, že jsem svým někdejším dotazem zřejmě &lt;a href="https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diskuse:Seznam_nej%C4%8Dast%C4%9Bj%C5%A1%C3%ADch_%C5%BEensk%C3%BDch_jmen_v_%C4%8Cesku#c-Moson81-2022-06-13T16%3A28%3A00.000Z-Honzajavorek-2021-03-21T16%3A04%3A00.000Z="&gt;zlepšil a zrovnoprávnil kousek české Wikipedie&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zavolal jsem si s &lt;a href="https://www.codeac.io/"&gt;Codeac&lt;/a&gt; a řešili jsme, jak bychom si mohli vzájemně pomoci.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sešli jsme se jako výbor Pyvce, po volbách poprvé v nové sestavě a bylo to fajn. Jde fakt vidět, že noví lidi mají nabité baterky a chuť něco dělat. Je to boží. Taky jsme přijali hned 4 další nové členy, kteří podali přihlášku.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mergnul jsem pár starých PR na &lt;a href="https://github.com/pyvec/docs.pyvec.org"&gt;docs.pyvec.org&lt;/a&gt;, upgradoval na nové verze knihoven a opravil nějaké věci.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Účastnil jsem se mezikomunitního sdílení, kde jsme trochu řešili i Slack vs Discord. Vím o subjektech, které se z Facebooku a Slacku přesouvají na Discord pro komunitní komunikaci, Czechitas teď vše přesouvají z Facebooku na Slack. #holkyzmarketingu řešily, jak aktivizovat seniorní lidi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="grafy-na-webu"&gt;Grafy na webu&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#grafy-na-webu" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abych se uměl lépe rozhodovat o dalším postupu v podnikání, případně abych mohl v reálném čase sledovat dopad produktových změn, které plánuji udělat, začal jsem do &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;stránky s grafy&lt;/a&gt; přidávat produktové metriky jako počet členů v klubu, atd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokusil jsem se to vytáhnout z dat v Memberful, ale jejich model je pochopitelně složitější než to, jak to chci vnímat já, takže tam jsou chyby a grafy zatím nefungují tak, jak bych chtěl. Oni řeší každou objednávku atd., zatímco já z toho potřebuji uplést něco abstraktnějšího. Když do toho člověk zabředne, zjistí, že na první dobrou věci vypadají jednoduše (např. vynést do grafu odchody lidí z klubu), ale jsou složité (lidé odpadávají z free trialů, z neplacených členství, mění tarify z měsíčního na roční a naopak, vyprší jim karta a pak se vrátí…).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toto tedy musím ještě nějak doladit. Charts.js a způsob, jakým grafy zobrazuji na webu, zatím funguje dobře a neměl jsem potřebu na něm zatím cokoliv měnit, akorát bylo občas obtížné najít na internetu správný způsob, jak graf nakonfigurovat, protože charts.js měly historicky několik verzí a např. odpovědi na Stack Overflow jsou vždy pro nějakou jinou z nich a zpravidla nikdy pro tu nejnovější.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Přidal jsem zatím tedy tyto metriky, všechny s chybami: vývoj počtu členů v klubu, breakdown typů členství, příchody a odchody, vývoj průměrné délky individuálně placeného členství, podíl žen v klubu. Tyto metriky bych chtěl opravit a na dlouho tím asi skončí upravování stránky s grafy, jelikož další metriky pro mě zatím nejsou dost důležité. Možná bych měl ještě nějak vymyslet ten &lt;em&gt;churn&lt;/em&gt;, ale moc se mi do toho nechce, protože je to strašně zamotané, co vlastně počítat a jak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="webexpo"&gt;WebExpo&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#webexpo" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vylosoval jsem dva lístky na konferenci, jak bylo domluveno. Jedna výherkyně nemohla, tak jsem losování opakoval. Obě losování jsem nahrál jako screencast a pro členy zveřejnil, aby věděli, že jsem si výherce nevymyslel. Lístky jsem výhercům předal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vytvořil jsem v klubu kanál přímo na WebExpo a pozval do něj všechny, o kterých jsem věděl, že na konferenci půjdou. Tam jsem se s lidmi koordinoval. Nakonec se různými cestami na konferenci dostalo skoro 15 lidí z klubu, juniorů i seniorů. Skupinka dobře zafungovala, hlavně holky se hned na začátku seznámily a pak utvořily samostatně fungující skupinku. Když v průběhu přišel někdo nový, seznámil jsem je a skupina se zvětšovala, lidé se osmělovali, atd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Já sám jsem potkal spoustu starých známých. Také jsem si obešel stánky a firmám říkal, co dělám. Většinou je to zaujalo a minimálně jsme se propojili na LinkedInu a přislíbili si další komunikaci. Asi bych měl navázat, ale nějak jsem na to zatím neměl energii. Také jsem se rozhodl, že zdražím, takže se jim možná ozvu až potom :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dostal jsem od Martina Michálka jeho novou knihu &lt;a href="https://www.vzhurudolu.cz/css-layout/"&gt;CSS: moderní layout&lt;/a&gt;, i s podpisem. Notovali jsme si a bavili jsme se o tom, že by pár knih mohlo jít i pro členy klubu, nebo že bychom mohli udělat nějakou stránku do příručky na JG, podobně jako teď připravuju s Nelou.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Překvapilo mě, jak hodně jsem si vlastně WebExpo užil, jak si ho užili junioři z klubu, a jak dobře to fungovalo na networking a otevírání byznysových dveří do různých firem. Nevím, jestli budu schopen na vše udělat patřičný &lt;em&gt;follow-up&lt;/em&gt;, ale i kdyby se o mě někdo jen dověděl, pak mě sledoval na LinkedIn a pak se časem sám ozval s tím, že firma chce podporovat klub, byl by to úspěch. Na to, co dělám, reagovali všichni velmi pozitivně. Rozhodně by šlo tuhle hru rozehrát ve velkém a chodit po akcích a prodávat. Já místo toho potřebuju teď ale spíš zklidnit. Šel jsem nakonec na hlavní párty i na afterparty a během dvou dnů jsem naspal asi 5 hodin celkem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dík Šárce, že mě na WebExpo pozvala, že umožnila členům klubu mít zajímavou slevu a vyhrát dva lístky, dík všem organizátorům. Konferenci jsem si fakt užil, ačkoliv jsem ji skoro celou prokecal a přednášek moc nestihl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="community-builders-world-2022"&gt;Community Builders' World 2022&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#community-builders-world-2022" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jednodenní konference &lt;a href="https://www.cbw2022.com/"&gt;CBW2022&lt;/a&gt; pro všechny lidi kolem komunit vznikla jako hurá nápad v &lt;a href="https://www.meetup.com/czech-community-of-community-builders/"&gt;Czech Community of Community Builders&lt;/a&gt; a lidé z této skupiny ji komunitně zorganizovali, v čele se dvěma dříči v podobě &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/necasjiri/"&gt;Jirky Nečase&lt;/a&gt; z Productboardu a &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ladislav-vasek/"&gt;Ladislava Vaška&lt;/a&gt; z CzechCrunch. A bylo to moc fajn!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jako ex-organizátora &lt;a href="https://cz.pycon.org/"&gt;PyCon CZ&lt;/a&gt; mě zaujala spousta zajímavých drobných detailů, jako dárky pro speakery, nanuky rozdané v největším horku, apod. Akce se odehrávala v &lt;a href="https://prostor39.cz/"&gt;Prostor39&lt;/a&gt;, což je místo, kolem kterého na Žižkově už dlouho chodím a chtěl jsem ho víc prozkoumat, abych věděl, zda by se třeba nehodilo pro Pyvo. Líbilo se mi, že na konferenci byly jak přednášky, tak workshopy, tak panely, tak lightning talky. To vše se střídalo během jediného dne a ještě šlo najít čas i pro networking, takže to mělo spád a stále se dělo něco zajímavého.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Já jsem měl přednášku o tom, jak mi v klubu pomáhá robot napsaný v Pythonu, &lt;a href="https://speakerdeck.com/honzajavorek/we-are-the-robots"&gt;slajdy tady&lt;/a&gt;. Byl jsem jako obvykle ve stresu. Původně jsem myslel, že to bude na 5 minut, ale bylo to na 10 minut. Neměl jsem moc čas si to připravit, noc před tím jsem pil s kamarádem nějaké černé kokosové pivo, takže poprvé jsem si to zkusil až cestou na konferenci někde pod stromem na náměstí. Měl jsem dojem, že to přednáším trochu jako robot, ale ostatní mě pak ujistili, že to bylo dobré a dokonce i zábavné. Nějaké ohlasy se pak objevily i na LinkedIn, takže asi dobrý!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Povídání s lidmi, kteří řeší podobné věci jako já, bylo perfektní. Odnesl jsem si z konference hodně „brouků v hlavě“ a nápadů. Například to, že bych asi měl outsourcovat marketing na sociálních sítích, pokud mi to bere už dost času a zároveň se do toho postupně musím víc a víc nutit. Že zkušenější člověk by zvládl i můj &lt;em&gt;tone of voice&lt;/em&gt; a dokázal napsat věci zhruba tak, jak bych je napsal já. Dost nad tím teď přemýšlím. Pokud byste měli na někoho doporučení, nebo mi sami chtěli se sociálními sítěmi pomoci, napište mi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dík všem hlavním organizátorům a dobrovolníkům z jejich týmu, konference byla moc fajn a jsem rád, že jsem na ní mohl vystoupit a účastnit se jí.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-akce"&gt;Další akce&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-akce" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takže to máme svatba, WebExpo párty číslo jedna, WebExpo párty číslo dva. Pak jedno hraní na kytary (a kýbl místo cajonu) v oblíbené kavárně, které taky skončilo nad ránem. Druhý den se nám ještě povedlo poprvé po volbách v téže kavárně sejít jako výbor Pyvce. Po schůzi jsem ještě zašel na večeři, pak pivo s kamarádem, který přijel z Brna. Pak další konference. Na pražské Pyvo nebo na narozeniny Česko.Digital jsem už dojít vůbec nedokázal, nezbyl čas, ani energie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snažil jsem se při tom všem nějak žonglovat otcovskou zodpovědnost, spánek, networking a získávání nových příležitostí, zábavu. Akce jsem si nenaplánoval, sešly se mi do dvou týdnů samy od sebe a každá z nich byla dobře opodstatněná a těžko vynechatelná. Teď mám ale šílený spánkový a energetický deficit, ze kterého se sbírám už od pátku. Dnes v pondělí se konečně cítím už trochu jako člověk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nejvtipnější je, že poslední akce byla konference o komunitách, kde se stále opakovalo, jak je důležité se sdružovat a jak skvělé je, když jsou lidi spolu a jak všichni dokážou více jako skupina. A já všemu přikyvoval, ale po těchto dvou týdnech vlastně teď nechci nikoho vidět a nikam chodit, abych dobil své introvertní a fyzické baterky :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Během 24 dní od 28.5. do 20.6. jsem naběhal 9 km, při procházkách nachodil 59 km, na túrách nachodil 12 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 35 hodin a zdolal při tom 80 kilometrů.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="co-planuji"&gt;Co plánuji&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#co-planuji" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do budoucna se mi rýsuje hned několik věcí. Měl jsem příležitost mluvit s hodně lidmi z firem a je jasné, že bych měl překopat ceník do jiné podoby a zároveň i zdražit. Chtěl bych zpracovat onboarding nových členů a udělat novou homepage. Všechny tyto věci by měly přispět ke stabilizaci růstu klubu, stabilizaci financí a lepšímu inbound marketingu, který by dál měl sám od sebe přivádět nové členy a firmy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blbé je, že na tyhle věci teď nemám moc čas pro samotnou každodenní agendu. Musím tedy přijít na to, jak ji co nejvíc omezit. Musím mít sílu některé věci zrušit pro nerentabilnost, delegovat (outsourcovat), nebo automatizovat. Taky teď neplánuju žádný další outbound marketing, ani žádné další akce. Spolu s tím, že by mohlo po dvou letech covidu hodně lidí odjet na dovolené, očekávám, že by v následujících měsících mohl přijít tak trochu „klid na práci“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tři věci, které bych chtěl zvládnout udělat příště:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zjistit, co můžu zrušit, delegovat, nebo automatizovat, abych měl víc času na samotné tvoření.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spočítat po čtvrt roce zase domácí finance a vymyslet nový ceník.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Podívat se na inzerát pro Processand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus:&lt;/strong&gt; Vymyslet MVP robotického onboardingu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-co-vy"&gt;A co vy?&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#a-co-vy" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud byste čistě náhodou měli dojem, že jste oproti mě za uplynulý týden vůbec nic nestihli, tak mám pro vás skvělou zprávu! V klidu se na ten dojem &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/neni-to-zavod/"&gt;můžete vykašlat&lt;/a&gt;. Není zač!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;V rámci úkolu z minulého týdne „zamyslet se nad novým ceníkem s tou 15% inflací a drahým plynem“ jsem se podíval do Trella a začal čistit různé kartičky a přehazovat sloupečky podle priorit. Ujasňoval jsem si, do čeho se už fakt musím bez řečí pustit a co delší dobu zanedbávám, přitom to má zásadní vliv na přísun lidí do klubu nebo chuť firem klub financovat. Outbound marketing teď dělat nechci, ale ten inbound má velké rezervy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Přemýšlel jsem, jak bych mohl zjednodušit a zdražit ceník pro firmy. Taky jsem přemýšlel, zda zdražit vstup do klubu lidem. Teď je to 109 Kč, ale s 15% inflací a zvyšujícími se cenami různých komodit to nemusí být udržitelné. Chleba v pekárně naproti už nás stojí přes 50 Kč, pivo stojí přes 50 Kč, zálohy na plyn se zvyšují skoro každý měsíc. Možná bych mohl zdražit na 149 Kč, nebo podobnou částku. Jestli to vůbec udělám a jestli to udělám jen pro nové lidi, nebo i pro staré, to se musím teprve rozhodnout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zatím jsem si říkal, že bych mohl zdražit od září, ale je možné, že se rozhodnu do toho nějak bouchnout i dřív. Každopádně bych to dal firmám i lidem vědět nějak s předstihem. Chci, aby členství v klubu bylo dostupné, ale teď když už mám na webu &lt;em&gt;fin aid&lt;/em&gt; pro ty, kdo si členství nemohou dovolit, nemusím tolik řešit nízkou cenu pro všechny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="schuzky-a-komunikace"&gt;Schůzky a komunikace&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#schuzky-a-komunikace" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volal jsem si s Šárkou z &lt;a href="https://www.programhrovani.cz/"&gt;ProgramHRování&lt;/a&gt;, bavili jsme se o podcastech a spolupráci Ataccamy s JG.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během psaní těchto poznámek jsem si zavolal s Veronikou z &lt;a href="https://www.ataccama.com/"&gt;Ataccamy&lt;/a&gt; a dohodli jsme spolupráci s JG.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sešel jsem se na kafe s &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/petra-kotuliakova/"&gt;Petrou Kotuliakovou&lt;/a&gt; z &lt;a href="https://ajtyvit.sk/"&gt;Aj ty v IT&lt;/a&gt;, byla zrovna v Praze. Prima pokec. Budu se s Aj ty v IT kamarádit a budeme si sdílet zkušenosti. Jedna z věcí, které zkusíme rozjet, je přidání SK nabídek práce na JG. Propojily mě s Profesia.sk, uvidíme co z toho bude.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domlouval jsem se tak trochu s &lt;a href="https://www.twguild.cz/"&gt;TWguild.cz&lt;/a&gt; na dalším postupu. Minimálně jsme si poslali loga a dali nebo dáme na weby. Opět jsem byl rád, že mám &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/graficky-manual/"&gt;VisualBook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Šli jsme k právničce podepsat výsledek voleb do výboru Pyvce, ať se to může poslat na soud a je to oficiální.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volal jsem si s &lt;a href="https://www.nelaprovazi.cz/"&gt;Nelou Slezákovou&lt;/a&gt; ohledně připravované stránky na JG o duševním zdraví.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ptal jsem se &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JirkaChadima"&gt;Jirky&lt;/a&gt; z Pure Storage, jestli nechce mít v klubu přednášku a řešili jsme termín.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Řešil jsem s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/madrvojt"&gt;Vojtou Mádrem&lt;/a&gt; detaily jeho plánované přednášky o C# a .NETu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Byl jsem na kafi s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lukaskonarovsky"&gt;Lukášem&lt;/a&gt; z &lt;a href="https://www.fakturoid.cz/"&gt;Fakturoidu&lt;/a&gt; a byl to výživný pokec. Několikrát mě přesvědčoval, že mám a musím zdražit. Bavili jsme se o tom, jaké mám s JG plány do budoucna a jaké mám v hlavě produkty, které bych mohl časem v rámci JG nabídnout. Uvědomil jsem si, že tyto diskuze moc často nevedu a že mi to pomohlo si některé věci ujasnit. Že by se mi hodil „byznysový“ mentor?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Napsal jsem Jakubovi z &lt;a href="https://www.processand.com/"&gt;Processandu&lt;/a&gt;, jestli už mají české s.r.o. a můžeme dotáhnout spolupráci s klubem. Mají a dotáhneme!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Napsal jsem do &lt;a href="https://nightofchances.com/"&gt;Night of Chances&lt;/a&gt;, že jsem u nich kdysi v Brně přednášel a nějaký jejich oficiální fotograf Jaroslav Novák mě tam vyfotil a jsou to delší dobu moje jediné dobré fotky a začal jsem je všude používat jako svoje profilovky a tak, tak s kým si mám vyřídit zpětnou legalizaci licence na ty fotky. Odepsali, že licenci má přímo NOC a speakeři se svými fotkami mohou volně nakládat, takže nemusím nic řešit. Prima, mám čistější svědomí :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="grafy"&gt;Grafy&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#grafy" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Všiml jsem si, že některé transakce na účtě se špatně kategorizují a &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;grafy s finančními výsledky&lt;/a&gt; tak nejsou přesné. Například vrácená daň z finančáku v tom udělala slušný guláš. Opravil jsem to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zkontroloval jsem, jak se počítá počet členů v klubu, který je nahoře na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/club/"&gt;stránce klubu&lt;/a&gt;. Bál jsem se, že počítám roboty nebo že bych mohl omylem započítat i lidi s neaktivním předplatným, apod. Zjistil jsem, že se to počítá správně :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chtěl jsem na stránku s grafy přidat procentuální meziroční růst, ale bylo to zhruba 90 % nebo kolik, tak jsem usoudil, že to není příliš užitečné číslo a zase jsem to smazal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Přidal jsem na stránku s grafy vývoj počtu členů v čase. Tento graf chci postupně vylepšovat. Zatím jsem do něj hodil pro zajímavost ještě čáru, která ukazuje jaký je v klubu podíl žen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mentoring"&gt;Mentoring&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#mentoring" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mentoring v klubu jsem posunul zase o malý kousek dál. Napsal jsem mentorům v privátní místnosti, že tam mohou psát a posílat mi zpětnou vazbu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taky jsem ještě doplnil pravidelnou zprávu do kanálu #pohovory, kde se z mentorů vezmou jen ti, kteří nabízí pohovory nanečisto nebo soustavnější přípravu na pohovor. Ve zprávě se píše, že nemají členové na tuto možnost pomoci zapomenout a nemají se bát ji využít.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Udělal jsem při tom chybu v kódu a zpráva se posílala vždy, když se spustil bot, ale druhý den jsem chybu opravil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ve středu mě pár členů klubu vytáhlo v Praze na pivo. Nakonec přišlo i pár lidí navíc, další lidi jsme náhodně potkali, a byla z toho moc pěkná párty. Na živo jsem potkal lidi, které jsem doteď znal jen z klubu, a taky jsem haluzí potkal CEO &lt;a href="https://skillmea.cz/"&gt;Skillmea&lt;/a&gt; (ex-Learn2Code), kterého jsem zrovna nedávno u vaření &lt;a href="https://streetofcode.sk/podcast/skillmea/"&gt;slyšel v podcastu&lt;/a&gt;, a možná z toho něco bude :D&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chtěl bych z klubu vyčistit mrtvé účty z dob, kdy úplně začínal jeho provoz, protože mám kvůli nim složitější kód a nesmyslnější grafy a čísla. Zjistil jsem ale, že jedna uživatelka má dva účty a nějak prapodivně propojené. Zeptal jsem se na Memberful supportu, jak to vyřešit, poradili mi a teď čekám, kdy se ona dostane k tomu, aby klikla. Potom zbytek vyčistím.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firmám, se kterými ještě řeším prodloužení členství v klubu, začal bot posílat maily o tom, že vyprší členství a lidi že mají zadat kartu. Tak jsem to lidem vysvětlil a firemní členství prodloužil o rok už teď, i když fakturu ještě poslat nemůžu, jelikož řešíme detaily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zahlasoval jsem v anketě &lt;a href="https://www.podcastroku.cz/"&gt;Podcast roku&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Člen klubu nemohl najít odkaz na jednu z proběhlých přednášek v klubu. Zjistil jsem, že u dvou posledních akcí jsem je zapomněl uložit do YAMLu a napravil jsem to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odstranil jsem větší kus kódu, který dělal jedinou věc - četl z Gitu poslední změnu souboru pro stránku s původní příručkou, aby se pak do stránky mohlo vepsat, že příručka byla aktualizována naposledy, třeba včera nebo před týdnem. Tato informace neměla moc význam ani na začátku, jak &lt;a href="https://blog.zvestov.cz/software%20development/2020/09/21/prirucka-o-hledani-prvni-prace-v-it.html"&gt;na svém blogu poznamenal i Luboš&lt;/a&gt;, natož dnes, když se příručka skládá už snad z 10 stránek a celé je to složitější.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upravil jsem pár textů na webu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Před časem jsem sdílel &lt;a href="https://www.hanakonecna.cz/jak-jsem-totalne-zvorala-pohovor/"&gt;článek Hany Konečné&lt;/a&gt;. Díky tomu si jí všiml &lt;a href="https://www.skoumal.com/"&gt;Skoumal&lt;/a&gt; a teď jsem se dověděl, že tam nastoupila a jsou s ní spokojení. Firma se rozhodla mi poděkovat, ačkoliv jsem nic nepožadoval. Poslal jsem fakturu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sociální sítě: nový díl &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/podcast/"&gt;podcastu&lt;/a&gt;, sleva na lístky na WebExpo (kód „friends“ má 15 %, členové klubu mají 20 % a ještě soutěž o lístky zdarma)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Klub, maily, a tak dále.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 7 dní od 21.5. do 27.5. jsem naběhal 18 km, při procházkách nachodil 12 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 8 hodin a zdolal při tom 30 kilometrů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aktuální finanční výsledky, návštěvnost a další čísla k JG &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;mám přímo na webu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="co-planuji"&gt;Co plánuji&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#co-planuji" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tři věci, které bych chtěl zvládnout udělat příště:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;přidat do &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;grafů&lt;/a&gt; produktové metriky,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;zkasírovat firmy, udělit jim přístupy, prostě pořešit partnerství, kterých se teď pár zrovna nasbíralo,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;zúčastnit se kamarádovy svatby (2 pracovní dny).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samozřejmě musím v pondělí ještě v klubu vylosovat a udělit dva lístky na WebExpo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-co-vy"&gt;A co vy?&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#a-co-vy" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud byste čistě náhodou měli dojem, že jste oproti mě za uplynulý týden vůbec nic nestihli, tak mám pro vás skvělou zprávu! V klidu se na ten dojem &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/neni-to-zavod/"&gt;můžete vykašlat&lt;/a&gt;. Není zač!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="co-me-zaujalo"&gt;Co mě zaujalo&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#co-me-zaujalo" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když si něco přečtu nebo poslechnu a líbí se mi to, &lt;a href="https://getpocket.com/@honzajavorek"&gt;sdílím to na Pocketu&lt;/a&gt;. Od posledních poznámek jsem sdílel toto:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://rosie.land/posts/the-community-engagement-trap/"&gt;The community engagement trap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dobré postřehy o tom, že aktivitu v komunitě není dobré brát jako jediné měřítko úspěšnosti komunity a vede ke „gejmování“ metriky kvůli číslům, ke škodě všech.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Není to vše, co jsem přečetl, slyšel nebo viděl, ale jen zlomek, který mě zaujal. K vygenerování tohoto seznamu jsem použil vlastní knihovnu &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/pocket-recommendations/"&gt;pocket-recommendations&lt;/a&gt;. Věci, které jsem sdílel v den psaní minulých poznámek, se opakují i v těch dalších a je to záměr, ne chyba.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category><category term="týdenní poznámky"></category><category term="junior.guru"></category></entry><entry><title>Týdenní poznámky #91: Dovolená ve Zlíně</title><link href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/tydenni-poznamky-91-dovolena-ve-zline/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-05-20T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2022-05-20T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Honza Javorek</name></author><id>tag:honzajavorek.cz,2022-05-20:/blog/tydenni-poznamky-91-dovolena-ve-zline/</id><summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utekl zase nějaký ten týden (14.5. — 20.5.) a tak &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/tydenni-poznamky-90-zmeny-v-mentoringu-a-stream-na-youtube/"&gt;stejně jako minule&lt;/a&gt; sepisuji, co jsem dělal a co zajímavého jsem se naučil.

&lt;h2 id="neco-jako-dovolena"&gt;Něco jako dovolená&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#neco-jako-dovolena" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tento týden jsme strávili ve Zlíně u babičky. Na dítě jsme tedy byli tři, když započítám kočku tak čtyři. Hned to byla mnohem větší pohoda, dovolím si tvrdit že pro všechny. Díky tomu jsem měl i čas chodit dost běhat, prakticky jsem se šel téměř denně provětrat na 10 km. Natáhli jsme internet na terasu a už teď se těším, až se tam vypravíme zase. Teď už jedeme vlakem zpátky do Prahy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sice to nebyla dovolená v pravém slova smyslu, přes týden jsem vlastně normálně pracoval. Tempo života bylo ale takové pomalejší a hlavně člověk neměl na očích starosti z místa, kde žije. Nemusel do detailů řešit naplňování ledničky, nemusel přemýšlet nad úklidem, nad odklízením krabic z parapetu, které tam jsou už věčnost, apod. Prostě mentální dovolená na baba hotelu. Jak jsem teď někde četl, &lt;a href="https://a2larm.cz/2021/09/dovolena-je-zmena-stavu-mysli-nezalezi-kde-jste-rika-fotografka-ktera-se-rekreovala-na-sidlisti-dablice/"&gt;dovolená je hlavně stav mysli&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vylepsovani-mentoringu"&gt;Vylepšování mentoringu&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#vylepsovani-mentoringu" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jal jsem se vylepšovat, jak funguje mentoring v klubu. Seznam mentorů v jedné zprávě se mi nakonec moc nelíbil, tak jsem založil kanál jen pro čtení, kde bot vytváří zvlášť zprávu pro každého mentora. Díky tomu mohou mít i obrázek. Taky jsem se naučil jak přidat ke zprávě tlačítka, na která jde klikat. Ty jsem použil pro odkazy k rezervaci termínu konzultace v kalendáři mentora.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mentoring kanál" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/mentoring-kanal.png" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bot je schopný přidávat mentory, pokud se objeví v YAMLu, nebo mazat, pokud z YAMLu zmizí. Nakonec vždy dává zprávu, která vysvětluje, jak mentoring funguje. Pokud někdo nový přijde do klubu a rozklikne si tento kanál, uvidí tuto zprávu, protože je v kanálu jako poslední. Na mentory si potom doscrolluje nahoru do historie. Bot se stará o to, aby návod na fungování mentoringu byl vždy poslední zpráva, i kdyby přidával nové mentory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mentoring info zpráva" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/mentoring-info.png" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K tomu jsem přidal novou pravidelnou zprávu do kanálu #parťáci a do #poradna. Jednou za měsíc se v parťácích připomene, že si tam lidi mohou hledat kámoše na společný projekt nebo společné učení a že mi mají napsat, pokud vytvoří skupinu a chtějí k tomu třeba privátní kanál na domlouvání. A je tam „reklama“ na to, že existuje #mentoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Zpráva v kanálu #parťáci" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/partaci-info.png" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do #poradna se zase jednou týdně napíše info o tom, jak to tam zhruba funguje a jak na Discordu najít tlačítko pro založení nového vlákna s otázkou. Zakládání vláken jsem následně vynutil oprávněními.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Zpráva v kanálu #poradna" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/poradna-info.png" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formulace budu časem ještě ladit. Taky bych chtěl přidat na web stránku o mentoringu a o tom, jak se správně ptát, kde se bude možné více rozepsat. Tyto pak chci odkazovat z oněch pravidelných zpráv.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zalohovaci-programek-na-icloud"&gt;Zálohovací prográmek na iCloud&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#zalohovaci-programek-na-icloud" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chtěl bych si zálohovat fotky a další věci na iCloud. Jenže ne pomocí Apple Photos, ale jako soubory. To zní jednoduše, prostě je dám na počítači do iCloud složky, že? Jenže toho mám nějaký ten terabajt. Chtěl jsem něco, co by soubory na iCloud prostě jednorázově nahrálo a ony tam byly jakoby z jiného zařízení. Můj macOS by se pak mohl rozhodnout, jestli tyto soubory chce, nebo nechce stahovat na disk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myslel jsem si, že něco takového není možné vyrobit, ale nedávno jsem narazil na knihovnu &lt;a href="https://github.com/picklepete/pyicloud"&gt;pyicloud&lt;/a&gt;, která to překvapivě umožňuje. Když jsem tedy měl o víkendu nějakou tu chvilku, mrknul jsem na to. Už dřív jsem si na 10 řádků napsal prototyp, který nahrál jeden soubor na iCloud, abych ověřil, zda to fakt funguje. Teď jsem začal vytvářet „seriózní“ prográmek, který vezme složku na mém disku, cestu na iCloudu a z jednoho místa soubory nahraje do druhého.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narazil jsem při tom na chyby v té knihovně, což mě dost zdrželo, jelikož jsem nikdy nevěděl, zda nedělám něco špatně já a snažil se věc debugovat. Ale byla to chyba v kódu. Knihovna nevypadá moc udržovaná, takže řešení je vždy v issues nebo v Pull Requestu, který nikdy nikdo nezamergoval. Nejdřív &lt;a href="https://github.com/picklepete/pyicloud/issues/326#issuecomment-1126925582="&gt;tohle&lt;/a&gt;, pak &lt;a href="https://github.com/picklepete/pyicloud/issues/337"&gt;toto&lt;/a&gt;. Opravy šlo naštěstí udělat pomocí &lt;em&gt;monkey patchingu&lt;/em&gt; a nemusel jsem knihovnu třeba forknout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dostal jsem se do fáze, že prográmek umí nahrát pár souborů na iCloud. Kdo ví, kdy se k tomu zase někdy dostanu a dodělám to. Zatím to nemám ani na GitHubu, je to jen kus kódu na disku.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Udělil jsem jedno stipendium na roční členství v klubu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odložili jsme na neurčito klubovou přednášku o frontendu, která měla být příští týden. Převážně kvůli covidu, který skolil speakera.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poslouchal jsem &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/podcast/"&gt;nový díl našeho podcastu&lt;/a&gt;, který vyšel s Tatankou. Byla to sranda, je to dobrý vypravěč.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Předělal jsem týdenní souhrn v klubu tak, aby nepoužíval v Discord embedu označování lidí, což se pak nezobrazuje úplně dobře v Discord klientech. Vypisuju tam teď proste jen &lt;em&gt;display name&lt;/em&gt;. Tady to vůbec nevadí, protože z embedu lidem stejně nechodí notifikace a klikatelné to tam být nemusí.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Šárka z &lt;a href="https://www.programhrovani.cz/"&gt;ProgramHRování&lt;/a&gt; mě poprosila, zda bych ji nepropojil s pár lidmi, většinou v souvislosti s organizací PyCon CZ. Propojil jsem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nová česká komunita pro dokumentaristy a &lt;em&gt;tech writers&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.twguild.cz/"&gt;TWguild.cz&lt;/a&gt;, měla organizační online call, ale nezvládl jsem tam dorazit. Spolupráci jsme ale o krůček posunuli, dal jsem jim přístup do klubu a na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/club/"&gt;klubovou stránku&lt;/a&gt; jsem přidal jejich logo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;S &lt;a href="https://ajtyvit.sk/"&gt;Aj ty v IT&lt;/a&gt; jsme se bavili o tom, že bych mohl mít na webu i slovenské nabídky práce. K tomu ale potřebuju scrapnout profesia.sk (to mi měly dohodnout) a umět třídit slovensky psané inzeráty. S tím by mělo pomoci ML, které chceme s kamarádem Mílou do bota zavést už dlouho. Udělal jsem tedy &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/junior.guru/issues/862"&gt;hrubý plán&lt;/a&gt; toho, jak by to mohlo probíhat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;StartupJobs přidali vyjímku pro JG do své ochrany proti robotům. Díky tomu zase funguje stahování log firem pro jejich inzeráty, takže na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/"&gt;inzerátech&lt;/a&gt; je teď o dost méně prázdných rámečků.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domlouval jsem se s &lt;a href="https://robime.it/"&gt;robime.it&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://www.webexpo.net/"&gt;WebExpo&lt;/a&gt;, zda si můžeme nějak pomoci.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domyslel jsem spolupráci s Engetem a napsal jsem jim.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zjistil jsem, že role v klubu „Mám #ahoj a profilovku“ (která má členy motivovat k představování a k tomu, aby si nahráli nějaký obrázek a šli od sebe odlišit) nefunguje správně. Jak jsem před časem optimalizoval stahování avatarů, tak se teď dávala jen lidem, pro které byly avatary stažené, takže asi jen 30 lidem z klubu. Všiml jsem si toho a opravil jsem to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dva lidi z Pure Storage neměli správnou firemní roli. Jeden jsem zjistil, že má vstup už od dřív díky tomu, že mě podporuje na GitHubu. Debugováním druhého jsem přišel na nějaký prapodivný bug v tom, jak zpracovávám data z Memberful. Zabralo mi dost času vymyslet, co mám vlastně dělat v případě, že má jeden uživatel víc &lt;em&gt;subscriptions&lt;/em&gt;. Vymýšlel jsem různé složitosti, ale nakonec jsem to smazal a udělal opravu na jeden řádek.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sociální sítě jsem zanedbával a nic jsem na ně nedal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Klub, maily, a tak dále.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 7 dní od 14.5. do 20.5. jsem naběhal 47 km, při procházkách nachodil 9 km, ujel na kole 9 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 9 hodin a zdolal při tom 65 kilometrů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aktuální finanční výsledky, návštěvnost a další čísla k JG &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;mám přímo na webu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tři věci, které bych chtěl zvládnout udělat příště:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vylepšovat mentoring,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;zamyslet se nad novým ceníkem s tou 15% inflací a drahým plynem,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;zvládnout pár byznysových schůzek v kavárně.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus č. 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Užít si &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/756977309009547/"&gt;Žižkovské mezidvorky&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="mentoring"&gt;Mentoring&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#mentoring" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Během úterý jsem vymyslel, jak chci pojmout nový mentoring. Přejmenoval jsem kanál #mentoring v klubu na #poradna a vytvořil novou pravidelnou zprávu do kanálu #parťáci, která upomíná na možnost sehnat si přes klub mentora na dlouhodobější 1:1 konzultace. Ve zprávě je i krátký návod, jak k tomu přistupovat a co od toho čekat. Změn bylo víc, ale pro čtenáře poznámek, kteří detailně neznají klub, jsou spíš nerelevantní.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mentory jsem si nově uložil do YAMLu a později během čtvrtka to předělal ještě tak, aby se mi to ukládalo i do SQLite a mohl jsem snadno data dotazovat (např. vytáhnout jen mentory, kteří nabízí i pohovory nanečisto atd.). Aktuálně je v klubu 14 mentorů, většina z Mews nebo Pure Storage, dva se přihlásili nezávisle sami. Další se mi už hlásí do soukromé zprávy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dalo mi dost práce celou zprávu naformátovat tak, aby se v ní dalo vyznat a bylo tam vše podstatné. Chtěl jsem se vyvarovat užívání mentions v tzv. embedu zprávy, protože to na straně Discordu blblo a často se místo jmen lidí zobrazovaly jen jejich ID čísla, což bylo matoucí. Pracuji teď spíše s &lt;code&gt;display_name&lt;/code&gt; členů. Většina mentorů má nějakou rezervaci časů přes Calendly apod., takže nevadí, že na ně není přímý proklik. U několika je ale kontakt jen přes Discord a je smutné, že proklik nejde snadno udělat. Napsal jsem tam aspoň jejich &lt;em&gt;tag&lt;/em&gt;, tedy takové to „honza#1234”, přes co by mělo být možné je ručně najít a napsat jim, ale je to neobratné a neintuitivní. Podobné změny bych chtěl udělat i v dalších zprávách od bota, kde se dělá mention na lidi, aby se už nikde neprojevovala ta chyba s čísly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do zprávy jsem se taky snažil co nejstručněji zachytit co vlastně tento 1:1 mentoring je, co od toho čekat a jak s tím pracovat. Pomohl jsem si &lt;a href="https://github.com/honzajavorek/become-mentor"&gt;přednáškou od Anny Ossowski&lt;/a&gt;, kterou bych časem chtěl nějak vložit i přímo na web JG. Do zprávy jsem sepsal jen pár bodů:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stanov si dlouhodobější cíl, kterého chceš dosáhnout (např. porozumět API)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Podle tématu si ze seznamu níže vyber mentorku/mentora. Rezervuj si čas na videohovor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domluvte se, jak často si chcete volat (např. každé dva týdny) a jak dlouho (např. 5×)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aktivita je na tvé straně. Rezervuješ další schůzky a víš předem, co na nich chceš řešit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mentorka/mentor radí, posouvá tě správným směrem, pomáhá ti dosáhnout cíle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pak ještě že mentoři jsou dobrovolníci, ne učitelé a ať si lidi váží jejich času a dopřejí jim dobrý pocit, pokud pomohli. Určité formulace jsem volil i na základě feedbacku, který jsem dostal z Mews o tom, jak dosavadní mentoringová sezení probíhala. Také jsem měl hodně poznámek z Mezikomunitního sdílení na téma mentoring, což je občasný videohovor s lidmi z jiných českých komunit, kde sdílíme know how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Z těchto poznámek vyplývala i spousta kroků, které bych mohl ještě dělat, např. ručně propojovat mentory a mentorované podle vyplněných dotazníků, dělat webináře pro mentory i mentorované, dělat rozhovory s mentory a mentorovanými o jejich zkušenostech z programu, vyzývat svou komunitu k tomu, aby v ní lidi mentorovali a to třeba i ti, kdo nejsou zas tolik zkušení. Ale tyto věci jsou podle mě z kategorie „mentoring je můj hlavní produkt“ a mohou si je dovolit třeba React Girls, Czechitas, nebo Femme Palette. Já potřebuji něco víc při zemi, co bude fungovat &lt;em&gt;dostatečně dobře&lt;/em&gt; a bude nějak škálovat bez ohledu na moje zapojení. Mentoring zatím není můj hlavní produkt, je to jedna z mnoha věcí, které se v klubu dějí. Budu doufat, že kvalitu mentorů zajišťují firmy, které je k tomu přemluvily, nebo samotné prostředí v klubu, pokud jsou přímo z klubu. Budu se snažit sbírat aspoň nějaký feedback, abych aspoň tušil, jestli je někde nějaký průšvih.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="intro-pure-storage"&gt;Intro Pure Storage&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#intro-pure-storage" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ve středu večer měla být akce v klubu, kde představím změny v mentoringu, vysvětlím co je v ideálním případě mentoring a představíme Pure Storage a mentory od nich, ať jsou to pro lidi v klubu reálné tváře. Udělal jsem si poznámky, co chci říkat a následně i jednoduché slajdy, abych se držel osnovy. Podobnou akci chci v budoucnu zopakovat s Mews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jak jsem už psal, chtěl jsem zkusit streamování přímo na YouTube, které má urychlit vytvoření záznamu přednášky a zároveň zajistit, že pokud by se náhodou chtělo připojit více jak 25 lidí, což je limit Discordu na video call, tak mohou stále vidět přednášku, protože jim pošlu odkaz na YT stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U této příležitosti jsem si dal konečně tu tříminutovou práci a nastavil &lt;a href="https://influencermarketinghub.com/youtube-video-size/"&gt;správný poměr stran nahrávaného videa v OBS Studio&lt;/a&gt;, takže se video nebude podivně tísnit na YT stránce a jeho úvodní obrázek nebude ošklivě napozicovaný a rozmazaný.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Streamování už jsem měl na YT zapnuté a povolené, tak jsem zkusil něco nahrát přes webkameru a pak i přes OBS Studio. Bylo to jednoduché. Šel jsem tedy do kódu JG a smazal vše související se „zrcadlem“, z JavaScriptu, CSS, i &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/speaker/"&gt;textů na stránce pro speakery&lt;/a&gt;. V hlasové místnosti na přednášky jsem uvolnil oprávnění, protože teď už není potřeba nic nikomu zakazovat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Během středy jsem si ještě uvědomil, že potřebuji jak přednášet a sdílet obrazovku, tak nahrávat (streamovat), a že mám jen jeden displej. Takže jsem si zkoušel různé překliky a jak přesně sdílet okna, co dělat a co nedělat, abych se v tom v průběhu přednášky nezamotal. Myslím, že to mělo velký vliv na kvalitu výsledku, bez této zkoušky bych se v tom rozhodně zamotal a měl velkou paniku.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samotná akce proběhla moc hezky a bez problémů, myslím, že to bylo přínosné a milé. Záznam se podařil a je celkem sledovatelný, ale obraz se seká. Na mluvící hlavy je to asi jedno, ale kdyby někdo dělal live coding a psal písmenka na obrazovku, už by to bylo horší. Taky YouTube mi napsalo hromadu chyb souvisejících s tím, že se tam snažím sice něco tlačit, ale netlačím dost. Diskutoval jsem o tom pak v klubu s &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomasmanhal/"&gt;Tomášem Maňhalem&lt;/a&gt;, členem klubu, který má se streamováním zkušenosti, a ten mi poradil ještě spoustu tipů a dal užitečné odkazy na to, jak to do budoucna vylepšit (díky!):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2853702?hl=en#zippy=%2Cp%2Cp-fps"&gt;Choose live encoder settings, bitrates, and resolutions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.boxcast.com/en/articles/4235072-suggested-upload-speeds-for-streaming"&gt;Suggested Upload Speeds for Streaming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.omnicalculator.com/other/streaming-bitrate"&gt;Streaming Bitrate Calculator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taky bych si mohl pustit nějaká videa o streamování, která pracují specificky s macOS a M1, což mě předtím, nevím proč nenapadlo. Třeba &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;amp;v=8S3jf-ahLe0"&gt;tohle&lt;/a&gt;. Celkově z toho ale vyplývá hlavně to, že bych si měl sehnat lepší internet, upload 5 Mbit/s na to, abych někam protlačil retina obrazovku, nestačí.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lepší internet je varianta a ani ne složitá na vyřešení, ale osobně bych radši poslal peníze Discordu za to, že mi dá limit lidí na video callu na 50 a nebudu muset řešit žádný stream. Nechci si z bytu dělat nahrávací studio, protože se nechci vázat na svůj byt. Už jednou jsem dělal v klubu přednášku, když jsme byli na několikadenní návštěvě u kamarádů. Co když někam pojedeme na měsíc? Co když pojedeme ke tchýni, která má nějaký bídný vesnický internet? A podobně jako u mentoringu, přednášky nejsou můj primární produkt, je to jen jedna z mnoha věcí, které se odehrávají v klubu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Věci v klubu musí škálovat a nesmí mě moc omezovat v životě. Proto nemám runtime a vše jede na CI jednou denně. Proto nemám studio se závěsy, pěti kamerami a mikrofony. Snažím se věci dělat tak akorát &lt;em&gt;good enough&lt;/em&gt;, aby výsledek sloužil lidem a já se z toho nepo… Takže zkusím ještě poladit do nastavení streamu, nastuduju si další detaily a uvidíme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vylepsovani-mentoringu"&gt;Vylepšování mentoringu&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#vylepsovani-mentoringu" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Po intru Pure Storage jsem začal pomalu dál vylepšovat mentoring. Doprogramoval jsem, aby bot dával mentorům roli „Mentoruju“ a vytvořil privátní kanál, kam mají přístup jen mentoři a moderátoři, a kde mohu sbírat zpětnou vazbu, nebo tam můžeme řešit případné problémy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dále jsem si připravil půdu pro zprávu, která by se mohla objevovat v kanálu #pohovory a upozorňovat na to, že v klubu jsou mentoři, kteří nabízí pohovory nanečisto a přípravu na pohovor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mezitím jsem ve sprše vymyslel, jak předělat zprávu s mentory tak, aby to nebyla nekonečná nudle a aby šlo vyřešit neprokliknutelné mentions. Bude to trochu víc programování, ale očekávám, že mentorů bude spíš přibývat i z řad dalších členů klubu a bude lepší, když to bude už teď robustnější. Chtěl bych vytvořit samostatný kanál, kde bude jen seznam mentorů a návod. Bude jen pro čtení. Každý mentor bude mít svou vlastní zprávu a bot ji bude aktualizovat podle informací v YAMLu. Jsem zvědavý, zda se mi to povede vytvořit a zda to bude fungovat, jak bych chtěl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mám v plánu v nejbližší době přidat: vylepšený výběr mentorů, jinou pravidelnou zprávu do kanálu #parťáci, pravidelnou zprávu do kanálu #pohovory, pravidelnou zprávu do kanálu #poradna. Dále novou kapitolu do příručky na téma mentoring a ještě jednu kapitolu, na téma jak se ptát. A všechno to provázat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zavolal jsem si s Veronikou Pizano z Aj ty v IT a bavili jsme se o tom, jak bychom mohli spolupracovat. Největší smysl dává, abych přidal podporu do třídícího robota pro slovensky psané nabídky práce a pokryl tak SK trh s nabídkami práce pro juniory. Zkusí mě spojit s někým z Profesia.sk. Další checkpoint bude po 18.5. až 19.5., kdy jsou nějaké Profesia Days. Já bych měl do té doby vymyslet plán, jakým by se dalo postupovat z mé strany.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přidal jsem si do svého zálohovacího skriptu složky s nastavením OBS Studio, protože jsem přesvědčený o tom, že kdybych o to nastavení přišel, už to nikdy nebudu schopný dát zase dohromady.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prošel jsem &lt;em&gt;watchtower&lt;/em&gt;, funkci 1Passwordu, která mě upozorňuje na potencálně uniklá hesla. Všude jsem si hesla změnil, bylo to asi 5 služeb. Díky tomu jsem se konečně dostal do jednoho účtu, kam se mi nedařilo už roky dostat. Služba totiž chtěla ověření, že jde opravdu o mě, ale nikdy mi nepřišel ověřovací kód na mail. Teď mě napadlo kouknout se do filtrů v emailové schránce a našel jsem tam nějaký filtr, zřejmě vytvořený kdysi ze zlosti, který všechny maily z této služby mazal…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kluky ze &lt;a href="https://streetofcode.sk/"&gt;Street of Code&lt;/a&gt; a Alenu z &lt;a href="https://restarty.dev/"&gt;(re)štarty v IT&lt;/a&gt; jsem pozval do klubu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sociální sítě: promo podcastu Street of Code a jejich dílu s robime.it, potom promo &lt;a href="https://www.heroine.cz/zeny-it/8100-jak-jsem-se-stal-ambasadorem-zacatecniku-v-it-zakladatel-junior-guru-o-vyhodach-komunity-a-sdileni"&gt;svého posledního článku pro Heroine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Klub, maily, a tak dále.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 7 dní od 7.5. do 13.5. jsem naběhal 6 km, při procházkách nachodil 8 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 5 hodin a zdolal při tom 14 kilometrů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aktuální finanční výsledky, návštěvnost a další čísla k JG &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;mám přímo na webu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tři věci, které bych chtěl zvládnout udělat příště:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vylepšovat mentoring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domyslet spolupráci s Engetem a ozvat se jim.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Připravit popis následující přednášky v klubu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-co-vy"&gt;A co vy?&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#a-co-vy" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tentokrát píšu ve vlaku. Musím říct, že vnímám značný rozdíl mezi tichým oddílem, na který jsem býval zvyklý, a dětským oddílem. Hraje mi tu třeba Sandokan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fonty-v-obrazcich"&gt;Fonty v obrázcích&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#fonty-v-obrazcich" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na JG používám obyčejný bezpatkový font. Když generuju různé obrázky u sebe na počítači, je to s Helveticou a texty jsou krásné. Když se ale generují na CI, použilo to nějaký linuxový font a texty byly hnusné. Takže jsem se snažil na ten Linux nainstalovat aspoň Arial z nějakého balíku MS fontů, ale to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trvalo dlouho a častokrát se to nedařilo napoprvé (selhalo stahování), takže jsem tam měl 3x retry v Bashi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pořád nevypadalo nejlíp a hlavně to pořád vypadalo jinak, než plakátky vygenerované u mě na počítači.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dřív jsem hledal, jak dostat na CI tu Helveticu, ale teď mě napadlo něco jiného. Zadal jsem do vyhledávače „most helvetica like free font“ a našlo to &lt;a href="https://learnui.design/blog/helvetica-similar-fonts.html"&gt;tento článek&lt;/a&gt;, kde jsem se dověděl o fontu Inter. Ten vypadá docela dobře.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zatímco na webu je mi přednější rychlost načítání než hraní si s fonty, u těch obrázků generovaných z HTML mi dává smysl natvrdo font určit a sjednotit jej mezi CI a mým počítačem. Nainstaloval jsem tedy ten Inter &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fontsource/inter"&gt;jako balíček z npm&lt;/a&gt; a bylo to!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No samozřejmě, že ne. Aby mi při generování obrázků fungovalo kompilování SCSS apod., dějou se tam čachry s temporary adresářem a kopírování věcí sem a tam. Přidat do toho fonty byl hrozný guláš a zabralo mi celé jedno dopoledne odladit to tak, aby se v těch náhledech dal použít jak font z Bootstrap Icons, tak tenhle Inter. CSS v těch fontových balíčcích používají relativní cesty k .woff souborům. Ty cesty se ale při importu do SCSS přenesou do výsledného CSS souboru tak jak jsou, takže pak by font musel být „na produkci“ ve stejně pojmenovaném adresáři a ve stejné struktuře, což by způsobilo strašný nepořádek. Nakonec jsem prostě nakopíroval soubory a to CSS regulárem přepsal, nic lepšího mě nenapadlo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oznameni-epizod-podcastu-v-klubu"&gt;Oznámení epizod podcastu v klubu&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#oznameni-epizod-podcastu-v-klubu" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K těm fontům jsem se dostal tak, že jsem pracoval na plakátcích k jednotlivým epizodám podcastu. Chtěl jsem je dát do XML podcastu, ale nelíbilo se mi, jak vypadají. Když jsem měl fonty vyřešené, zase jsem si uvědomil, že se tam ty plakátky moc nehodí a nakonec jsem do XML k epizodám dal zatím jen obrázky jednotlivých hostů :) Ty jsem přidal i na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/podcast/"&gt;stránku podcastu&lt;/a&gt;, ať se v jednotlivých dílech lépe vizuálně orientuje.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pak stačilo udělat skript, který oznamuje nové podcasty do klubu. To už bylo jednoduché, takových skriptů tam mám už víc. Při té příležitosti jsem ale upravil YAML s daty o podcastu tak, že se do něj dá zapsat délka zvukových souborů a další data potřebná pro XML s podcastem. Tato data jsem předtím zjišťoval stahováním jednotlivých dílů a jejich analýzou, ale trvá to dlouho a jak je dílů stále víc, je to otravné. Teď se to stáhne jen pokud to skript nenajde v YAMLu a potom mi to do logu vypíše přesně řádky, které mám do YAMLu přidat, aby se to stahovat nemuselo. To mi umožňuje ručně optimalizovat tempem, jaké je mi příjemné. Když nebudu mít moc času si s tím hrát, můžu díl publikovat i bez toho. Když budu mít vše v YAMLu, skript proběhne super rychle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pak jsem si všiml, že se mi plakátky vždy přegenerují, ačkoliv by se měly cachovat. Klíč ke cachování obsahuje data, která posílám do HTML šablony pro obrázek s plakátkem. Ta data obsahují databázový objekt s epizodou podcastu. Ten obsahuje atribut &lt;code&gt;._dirty&lt;/code&gt;, kde si Peewee udržuje informace o tom, jaké atributy byly změněny. Je to množina. A když se množina prožene přes pickle a pak se to ukládá jako string, mohou prvky v té množině být v náhodném pořadí, pokaždé jinak. A to způsobovalo, že byl klíč ke kešování vždy jiný :D Rozebral jsem traktor a udělal jednořádkovou změnu, která to opravila.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="scheduled-events-na-discordu"&gt;Scheduled Events na Discordu&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#scheduled-events-na-discordu" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upravil jsem skript na akce v klubu, aby uměl z dat v YAMLu eventy na Discordu nejen zakládat, ale i aktualizovat. U toho jsem si všiml, že mohu k eventu přidat i obrázek. Říkám si, že když už do toho vrtám, tak to udělám, ale nepřišel jsem na to jak. Je to zas nějaký úplně jiný způsob, než co mi fungovalo kdekoliv jinde v discord.py/py-cord knihovně. Ptal jsem se na py-cord Discordu, ale nic, takže jsem založil &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/72134026/325365"&gt;dotaz na Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mentoring"&gt;Mentoring&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#mentoring" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Byl jsem v Karlíně u Pure Storage a probírali jsme, jak bude vypadat středeční event v klubu, kde chci členům připomenout, jak v klubu funguje mentoring, co to obnáší, co to je a co to není, a představit nové mentorky a mentory z Pure Storage. Posezení to bylo moc fajn a vše důležité jsme probrali, dostal jsem i dost nepřímých podnětů, co by šlo vylepšit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsal jsem anotaci k eventu a publikoval, ať už je v klubu k dispozici informace s plakátkem pro členy, že akce bude a o čem to bude. Také jsem sepsal status na sociální sítě o našem partnerství a o mentoringu v klubu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Následně jsem se shodou okolností viděl na kafi i s Janem Meissnerem z Mews, s nímž jsme původně celý 1:1 mentoring v klubu vymysleli a rozjeli. Získal jsem od něj další feedback na to, jak to funguje nebo jak by to fungovat mohlo a domluvili jsme se, co dál a že udělám podobné intro ještě jedno i s jejich mentory (to jsem sám nabídl, protože mi to dává velký smysl). Zpětná vazba z Mews je super v tom, že už je skoro po roce provozu a dá se u toho poučit z reálného chování lidí.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zároveň jsem nedávno byl na mezikomunitním setkání, kde se téma mentoringu řešilo a mám z toho spoustu poznámek. No a tohle všechno teď dávám dohromady do jednoho kastrólu ve své hlavě a míchám a do středy bych chtěl vymyslet nějaký mentoring 2.0, který bych na tom večerním eventu oznámil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Udělal jsem o tom i vlákno přímo v klubu, v kanálu #nápady-klub, kde se ptám na zpětnou vazbu i členů. Myslím, že bude důležité hlavně pojmenovávat věci správnými slovy a dát mentoringu nějaký rámec a nastavit společná očekávání co to jakože vlastně vůbec je, na co to slouží a na co ne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jestli to celé dám dohromady do středy? Bude to celkem výzva, ale když se to celé tak sešlo, asi v blízké době nebude lepší moment, kdy to zkusit posunout na jiný level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="streamovani-na-youtube"&gt;Streamování na YouTube&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#streamovani-na-youtube" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discord má limit 25 lidí na callu, pokud se používá video. Vymyslel jsem &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/speaker/"&gt;zrcadlo&lt;/a&gt;, které to řeší, ale pro speakery je to divné a neintuitivní, navíc přenáším limitace své platformy na ně.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternativní řešení by mohlo být streamovat přednášku na YouTube a kdo se nevleze, odsleduje aspoň tam. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtipBVW4vxA"&gt;Nastudoval jsem si&lt;/a&gt;, jak se to s OBS dělá a když jsem to chtěl konečně vyzkoušet, napsalo mi YouTube, že fičura streamování se zapíná 24 hodin a mám den počkat. Takže jsem to nevyzkoušel, zapne se to (snad) až během dnešního odpoledne ¯\_(ツ)_/¯&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Během čtení věcí o streamování jsem ale narazil na &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/obs/comments/kobcy6/window_capture_on_osx_is_laggy/"&gt;info o tom, že na macOS se v OBS hodně seká obraz při nahrávání konkrétního okna&lt;/a&gt;, což je přesně to, co dělám a u čeho se mi obraz fakt seká. Myslel jsem, že to je tím „zrcadlem“, ale když jsem koukal na starší záznamy, tam se to seká taky. Takže jsme si tam toho jenom všimli, ale je to něčím jiným. Důvody sekání jsou nejasné, na macOS prostě OBS v tomto případě nevymáčkne lepší kvalitu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lidi to obcházejí různě. Buď mají Windows, nebo externí displej a nahrávají ho celý, protože v takovém případě OBS z macOS vymáčkne víc. Má to ale zase jiné nevýhody. Taky jsem objevil něco, co se jmenuje OBS Ninja, teda dnes už &lt;a href="https://vdo.ninja/"&gt;VDO Ninja&lt;/a&gt;. Trochu jsem si to proklikával, ale najít adekvátní řešení je asi na dlouhé lokty a mnoho zkoušení různých kombinací. Navíc se všechno postupně mění s vydáváním nových macOS i nových OBS, takže třeba &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3uDpGMzHCg"&gt;toto video&lt;/a&gt; už je jakože zastaralé a nedá se v tom vyznat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teď je ale priorita streamování, tak to vyzkouším co nejdřív. Nejbližší akce v klubu je ve středu. To sekání je nepříjemné, ale jestli je na 10 předchozích záznamech, tak se asi svět nezboří, když bude i na jedenáctém. Aspoň jsem poladil vzhled YouTube kanálu a některé popisky tam. Moc jsem to ale nepřeháněl, spíš update, než revoluce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="aj-ty-v-it"&gt;Aj ty v IT&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#aj-ty-v-it" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poslouchal jsem v parku podcast &lt;a href="https://wp.streetofcode.sk/podcast/dievcata-a-zeny-v-it/?utm_source=rss&amp;amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;amp;utm_campaign=dievcata-a-zeny-v-it"&gt;Steet of Code&lt;/a&gt; a byla tam nějaká Veronika Pizano z &lt;a href="https://ajtyvit.sk/"&gt;Aj ty v IT&lt;/a&gt;. Strašně se mi líbilo, co tam říkala a byl jsem nadšený snad z každé věty. Přidal jsem si ji hned na LinkedIn a ve zprávě podcast chválil. Nezávisle na tom jsem se přidával na Aj ty v IT Discord (přidával jsem se hned na několik podobných Discordů). Tam mě uvítala nějaká Veronika. Chvíli mi to trvalo, ale nakonec jsem si spojil, že jde o stejnou osobu :D Každopádně jsme se začali bavit o tom, zda můžeme nějak spolupracovat. V pondělí si budeme volat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opět nezávisle na tom jsem na LinkedIn narazil na CEO Aj ty v IT Petru Kotuliakovou a přidal jsem si ji, protože jsem chtěl číst její statusy a dovědět se víc o lidech, kteří jsou v čele Aj ty v IT, resp. srovnat si to třeba s Ditou z Czechitas. Petra mi hned napsala a je dost možné, že se uvidíme v Praze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevím, co se děje, ale mávnutím motýlích křídel jsem se z člověka, který sice Aj ty v IT fandí, ale vlastně o nich nic dalšího moc neví a nemá tam žádné kontakty, stal člověkem, který si s nimi má zavolat a sejít se s nimi :) Tak jsem zvědavý, co vymyslíme. Bylo by dobré, kdybych měl třeba &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/"&gt;na webu&lt;/a&gt; slovenské nabídky práce, ale to je bohužel zatím z hlediska mého vytížení spíš hudba daleké budoucnosti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dan Srb měl mít přednášku v klubu, ale nestíhal to připravit. Posunuli jsme to na pozdější datum. Díky naplánovanému eventu s Pure Storage mi to vlastně ani nevadí, aspoň budou věci v klidnějším tempu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Janis Ozolins &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OzolinsJanis/status/1519628239253106690"&gt;jedním jediným obrázkem vysvětlil&lt;/a&gt;, proč tyto poznámky bývají nesnesitelně dlouhé (píšu je rychle) a proč jsou kapitoly v příručce údernější (jeden odstavec tam edituji i několik dní).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Napsal jsem si s kluky ze Street of Code a třeba spolu něco vymyslíme.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domlouvám se s Inuits a Mews, že budou prodlužovat členství v klubu na další rok.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Řešil jsem s právničkou všechny detaily formalizace voleb do výboru spolku a zapsání změn do rejstříku.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přidal jsem se na Discord Street of Code, robime.it, Aj ty v IT, Informatika s Mišom. Kromě klubu jiné Discordy číst vůbec nestíhám, ale musím mít přehled a chci být k dispozici, kdyby mě někdo chtěl označit. Přehled znamená, že koukám, jak dělají jiné Discordy třeba &lt;em&gt;onboarding&lt;/em&gt; nových členů, nebo které věci jsou produktově spíš „komodita“ a které jsou u mě unikátní.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tweetnul jsem si &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1520684708031516672"&gt;vlákno o tom, jakou mapu bych na Mapy.cz chtěl&lt;/a&gt;. Bylo to celkem populární, nasbíralo to přes 230 lajků. Asi nejsem sám.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dostal jsem nabídku kandidovat na Praze 3 v letošních komunálních volbách.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prošel jsem všechno v klubu. Zkusil jsem odpovědět na co nejvíc mailů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Šéfredaktorka Anna Urbanová &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/anna.urbanova.904/posts/10217352432801804"&gt;si dává pauzu od Heroine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volali jsme si s Nelou Slezákovou a probírali novou kapitolu v příručce pro juniory, která by měla být o duševním zdraví. Nela teď bude ladit text a zavoláme si zase za pár týdnů. Já jsem před callem ještě novou kapitolu ladil, hlavně po vizuální stránce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meetup asi změnil URL kalendářových exportů, takže to rozbilo python.cz. Zjistil jsem, jaká jsou nová URL a &lt;a href="https://github.com/pyvec/python.cz/commit/3330d1e024d510e6d01c2d6ab8a94dd6f4344e8b"&gt;opravil jsem to&lt;/a&gt;. Snad to teď funguje :D&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 7 dní od 30.4. do 6.5. jsem naběhal 10 km, při procházkách nachodil 35 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 16 hodin a zdolal při tom 45 kilometrů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aktuální finanční výsledky, návštěvnost a další čísla k JG &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;mám přímo na webu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tři věci, které bych chtěl zvládnout udělat příště:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vymyslet změny v mentoringu, uskutečnit je&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a úspěšně zorganizovat středeční večerní event v klubu :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zkusit streamování na YouTube a když budu odvážný, hned to ve středu použít.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-co-vy"&gt;A co vy?&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#a-co-vy" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud byste čistě náhodou měli dojem, že jste oproti mě za uplynulý týden vůbec nic nestihli, tak mám pro vás skvělou zprávu! V klidu se na ten dojem &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/neni-to-zavod/"&gt;můžete vykašlat&lt;/a&gt;. Není zač!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="co-me-zaujalo"&gt;Co mě zaujalo&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#co-me-zaujalo" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když si něco přečtu nebo poslechnu a líbí se mi to, &lt;a href="https://getpocket.com/@honzajavorek"&gt;sdílím to na Pocketu&lt;/a&gt;. Od posledních poznámek jsem sdílel toto:&lt;/p&gt;

Mnoho zajímavých popisů nezdařených produktů a produktových strategií. Kromě nostalgie a osvěžení paměti také soupis všech absurdit, o kterých jsem ani nevěděl, že existovaly. Ze všeho nejvíc to pro mě osobně má „Oracle vibes“, kde jsem podobné změny zaměření a priorit z roku na rok viděl taky.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id="nova-stranka-na-prirucce"&gt;Nová stránka na příručce&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#nova-stranka-na-prirucce" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S &lt;a href="https://www.nelaprovazi.cz/"&gt;Nelou Slezákovou&lt;/a&gt; připravujeme novou stránku do &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/handbook/"&gt;příručky&lt;/a&gt;, která bude o duševním zdraví. Měli jsme už připravený nějaký základní text, tento týden jsem jej vysázel do příručky už přímo do HTML, tedy spíš do Markdownu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tato nová stránka bude prototypem spolupráce JG s nějakým nezávislým profesionálem. Takovou spolupráci jsem měl už déle v hlavě a tady byla hezká příležitost to zkusit. Jsem (snad) schopen udržovat jádro příručky sám, ale byla by škoda se omezit jen na to, čemu rozumím já. Chtěl bych tam mít stránky psané a „garantované“ i jinými odborníky, které znám a kterým věřím, výměnou za to, že tam bude odkaz na něco, čím se zabývají. Není to bez práce, stále tam figuruji jako nějaký editor, ale aspoň nemusím dělat velkou rešerši nějakého tématu a mohu se opřít o expertízu někoho dalšího a už to společně „jen“ napsat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takže ve spolupráci s Nelou píšeme tuto novou stránku a ona tam bude mít odkaz na sebe. Juniorům to pomůže, jí to pomůže, mě to pomůže. Win win win. Teď je to ve fázi že nám tam pár drobností ještě chybí v obsahu i designu. Obsah doplní Nela, já bych měl v CSS vymyslet, jak bude vypadat ten zvýrazněný odkaz na ni, aby bylo zřejmé, že to je nějaká spolupráce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="generovani-obrazku-pro-podcasty"&gt;Generování obrázků pro podcasty&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#generovani-obrazku-pro-podcasty" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obrázky pro propagaci jednotlivých dílů podcastů jsem doteď „kreslil ručně“, tedy vždy splácal dohromady z nějakých obdélníčků v programu Keynote a exportoval jako PNG. Teď jsem to chtěl už automatizovat, protože to vypadá, že podcast bude chvíli ještě existovat :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obrázky využiju při ruční propagaci. Mohu je použít i přímo v podcastovém feedu a budou se zobrazovat na jednotlivých platformách. Taky jsem chtěl naučit bota, aby díly oznamoval přímo v klubu a tam se opět bude obrázek hodit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="fotky-ucastniku-podcastu"&gt;Fotky účastníků podcastu&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#fotky-ucastniku-podcastu" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potřeboval jsem vyřešit dvě věci. První byla přidávání fotek účastníků podcastu. Pavlína vždy do YAMLu jen poslala přes Pull Request detaily k novému dílu, zbytek jsem zajistil já. Teď tam bude nová položka, cesta k fotce hosta. Tu nebude muset vyplňovat, fotku zajistím já, ale bude potřeba ji mít v tom YAMLu, načíst, atd. Na podobné fotky jsem už měl složku k přednáškám, pro které se taky generují náhledy. Přišlo mi zbytečné mít složku pro každou takovou věc, zvlášť když se kryjí někteří speakeři s hosty v podcastu. Tedy jsem to trochu překopal. Taky jsem u přednášek změnil YAML tak, aby se musela cesta k fotce všude explicitně napsat a už to není vázáno na nějaké Discord ID jako předtím, bylo to zbytečné a omezující provázání.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teď mám tedy jednu složku s fotkami všech takových lidí a odkazuje na ni jak YAML pro přednášky, tak YAML pro podcast. Napsal jsem si kontroly, jestli mají fotky očekávaný tvar a velikost, aby skripty spadly, pokud nemají. To je nedokonalá ochrana (asi by to měl být spíš nějaký git hook) hlavně proti tomu, abych si necommitnul do Gitu omylem několikamegabytovou fotku, protože to by pak zůstalo v historii navěky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Přidal jsem i separátní skript, kterým mohu nové fotky doplňovat. Zeptá se mě na cestu k souboru a jméno člověka a postará se o zbytek. Nakopíruje fotku do příslušného adresáře, ověří že jde o čtverec, zmenší, správně pojmenuje.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="scss-v-sablonach-pro-obrazky"&gt;SCSS v šablonách pro obrázky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#scss-v-sablonach-pro-obrazky" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Další věcí bylo sjednocení CSS tak, abych v těchto obrázcích generovaných z HTML šablon mohl používat vše, co i na webu. Donutil mě k tomu barevný pás tlačítek na různé podcastové aplikace, který jsem měl na původním „ručním“ plakátku. Ten jsem tam původně vlepil jako screenshot z webu, ale teď jsem to chtěl mít hezky v HTML, s tím stejným CSS jako na webu. Abych mohl použít totéž CSS, musel bych mít v šablonách nějak přístupný Bootstrap a celé svoje SCSS a nějak by se muselo přegenerovávat na čisté CSS při tom, jak se obrázek renderuje. Tomu jsem se dlouho bránil, ale reálně jsem na to narážel už ve víc případech, jelikož pokud se snažím dodržovat nějaký podobný vizuální jazyk na plakátkách jako na webu, prostě pak musím sdílet minimálně nějaké SCSS proměnné a tak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Přesunul jsem tedy SCSS o několik složek výš, aby nebylo jen pro web, ale pro libovolný kód v rámci JG, stejně jako jsem to už dřív udělal s obrázky. Pak jsem do kódu, který generuje obrázky, přidal nějaké srandy, které jsou schopny si poradit i s tím SCSS. Bylo to celé jednodušší, než jsem čekal a navenek se ani nic moc nezměnilo, jen jsem pak přejmenoval .css soubory na .scss a vše stále fungovalo, ale s většími možnostmi. Staré plakáty jsem nijak nemigroval, nový už jsem napsal tak, že vychází z Bootstrapu a mého dalšího SCSS, takže jsem tam mohl snadno použít barvy, tlačítka apod. stejně jako když styluju web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="co-dal"&gt;Co dál?&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#co-dal" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V pondělí jsem nově generovaný plakát rovnou použil při propagaci. Dál by bylo dobré naučit bota propagovat nové díly v klubu za mě a taky bych mohl plakátky přidat do XML podcastu, aby se objevovaly v podcastových aplikacích k jednotlivým dílům. S Pavlínou jsme se ještě bavili o vzhledu toho plakátu a máme nějaké nápady jak ho vylepšit, ale to se dá zase ladit klidně až v budoucnu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="prace-pro-pyvec"&gt;Práce pro Pyvec&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#prace-pro-pyvec" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Po volbách do výboru Pyvce je nyní potřeba udělat spoustu věcí, tak jsem se tomu trochu věnoval. Dali jsme si společný call starý a nový výbor. Tam si nový výbor zvolil předsedkyni a pokladníka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taky jsem upgradoval knihovny v Pyvec repozitářích přes dependabot, ale tak to dělám každý týden, asi nemá smysl to tu ani pořád psát. Následně jsem dával lidem přístupy do různých míst a oznamoval změny na Pyvec Slacku na různých místech (GitHub, Slack…). Inicioval jsem, aby se výbor poprvé sešel na pravidelné měsíční schůzi a vybíráme teď termín. Přihlásil jsem se dobrovolně k tomu, že kontaktuji právničku, aby nám udělala papíry k volbám a zanesla změny do rejstříku.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Přišla nám hned nová žádost o členství ve spolku, tak až se sejdeme, můžeme se hned procvičit v hlasování.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Začal se mi na CI dost projevovat &lt;a href="https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/3336"&gt;tento problém s poetry&lt;/a&gt;. Chvíli jsem to trpěl, ale teď už mě to přestalo bavit a obešel jsem to přes workaround zmíněný v tom issue, vypnul jsem něco, čemu říkají „new installer“.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volal jsem si s Engetem a vymýšleli jsme, jak můžeme spolupracovat na další rok. Byl z toho dlouhý call a je z toho spousta nápadů, které musím ještě promyslet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poslaly se mi v pondělí dvakrát maily inzerentům. Zjistil jsem, že jsem měl celou dobu v CircleCI nastavenou špatnou cestu k souboru, který řídil cache, která zabraňovala opakovanému odeslání. Bohužel chybějící soubor, který by se měl kešovat, není důvodem k failnutí jobu, takže jsem to doteď nezjistil. Opravil jsem to a maily se poslaly potřetí. Protože byl stejný klíč pro cache, takže CircleCI novou cache neuložilo a nepřepsalo ono „nic“ z minula :D Počtvrté už se to povedlo správně a nic se už neposlalo, uf.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opravil jsem si Stylelint ve VS Code, aby fungoval.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domlouval jsem se s lidmi, jestli a kdy se někdy potkáme.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vymýšleli jsme se StartupJobs, jak můžeme nějak víc spolupracovat, hlavně na obsahu jejich vzdělávací sekce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Připomínal jsem se firmám, ať už s prodlužováním členství v klubu, nebo s dalšími kroky v naplňování závazků, které jsme si domluvili. S Pure Storage chceme rozjet nabídku mentoringu v klubu, ale stále ladíme detaily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domluvil jsem dvě až tři další přednášky do klubu. Juchů! Hned jsem si je nahodil do svého YAMLu a tentokrát jsem ani nečekal, až budou všechny detaily a napsal tam u všeho prostě jen „bude upřesněno“ a &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/events/"&gt;nechal to, ať se to zobrazí&lt;/a&gt;. Což ale způsobilo, že se vytvořily už i eventy na Discordu a klikají se na ně lidi. Nepamatuju si už ale, zda bot umí u těch eventů i aktualizovat popis, když se v budoucnu změní, tak snad jo, jinak to budu muset pak nějak editovat ručně, nebo nechat jak to je, se vším tím „bude upřesněno“ :D&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ověřil jsem, že se námi podporovaný kluk se stipendiem dostal do všech služeb a všechny přístupy mu fungují.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vyšel mi (zatím) poslední článek na Heroine: &lt;a href="https://www.heroine.cz/zeny-it/8100-jak-jsem-se-stal-ambasadorem-zacatecniku-v-it-zakladatel-junior-guru-o-vyhodach-komunity-a-sdileni"&gt;Jak jsem se stal ambasadorem začátečníků v IT. Zakladatel junior.guru o výhodách komunity a sdílení&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Propagoval jsem &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/podcast/"&gt;nový díl JG podcastu s Terezou z ReactGirls&lt;/a&gt;. Propagoval jsem prodloužené partnerství s &lt;a href="https://lynt.cz/"&gt;Lynt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opravil jsem zase několik „rozbitých“ odkazů na webu, které nejsou ve skutečnosti rozbité, a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1518864988991102976"&gt;zanadával jsem si o tom na Twitteru&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tento týden se nakupila spousta mailů a další administrativy. Snažím se to omezovat na dva dny v týdnu, ale jde to těžko. Aktuálně mám například v inboxu 7 méně důležitých emailů, ke kterým se nejsem schopen dostat už několik měsíců a už tam vidím jeden další, kterému se to asi stane taky, protože obsahuje nekonečně mnoho textu a nelze z toho ani zjistit, co ten člověk vlastně chce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sešel jsem se s Alicou z podcastu &lt;a href="https://restarty.dev"&gt;(re)štarty v IT&lt;/a&gt; a povídali jsme si v rámci přípravy na samotné nahrávání.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Objevil jsem Mutanti hledaj východisko a nadchlo mě to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Radoval jsem se z toho, že byl McLaren v Imole na bedně. Sice ještě nejsem po svém obnoveném zájmu o F1 po snad víc jak 10 letech naplno rozhodnutý, že fandím zrovna jim, ale pokukuju po nich. Kamarád fandí Ferrari a to třetí místo měli mít oni, kdyby neudělali chybu, takže o to víc mi dává smysl mít z toho radost :D&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prošel jsem několikrát klub a odpovídal lidem, ale popravdě jsem to tento týden trochu zanedbával, nestíhal jsem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 7 dní od 23.4. do 29.4. jsem při procházkách nachodil 15 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 6 hodin a zdolal při tom 15 kilometrů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aktuální finanční výsledky, návštěvnost a další čísla k JG &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;mám přímo na webu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tři věci, které bych chtěl zvládnout udělat příště:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Naučit bota v klubu díly podcastu oznamovat za mě a přidat obrázky dílů do XML,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;zkusit streamování na YouTube,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nastylovat odkaz na Nelu na nové stránce do příručky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-co-vy"&gt;A co vy?&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#a-co-vy" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud byste čistě náhodou měli dojem, že jste oproti mě za uplynulý týden vůbec nic nestihli, tak mám pro vás skvělou zprávu! V klidu se na ten dojem &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/neni-to-zavod/"&gt;můžete vykašlat&lt;/a&gt;. Není zač!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="co-me-zaujalo"&gt;Co mě zaujalo&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#co-me-zaujalo" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když si něco přečtu nebo poslechnu a líbí se mi to, &lt;a href="https://getpocket.com/@honzajavorek"&gt;sdílím to na Pocketu&lt;/a&gt;. Od posledních poznámek jsem sdílel toto:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://overcast.fm/+Vf9THCkSA"&gt;Vladimir 518: Praha ještě zazáří. Je třeba stavět, ale také pečovat o ikonické stavby z minulosti&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rozhovor o architektuře a Praze, líbilo se mi to.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tak je pátek ráno a první co dělám, je psaní poznámek. Juchů, povedlo se mi to! Sice se mi to nepovedlo minulý pátek, ten sváteční velikonoční, ale to nevadí. Stále nerezignuji na vytvoření nového zvyku.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="stipendium"&gt;Stipendium&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#stipendium" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Již dlouho jsem chtěl spustit stipendium, které by umožnilo jít do klubu i lidem, kteří stovku měsíčně nemají, ale mají velkou vlastní vnitřní motivaci a myslí si, že by jim klub hodně pomohl. Buď bych si nechal jejich členství proplatit od nějaké firmy, nebo jim ho prostě dal, podle toho kolik by toho bylo, nebo jestli by se mi podařilo domluvit nějakou spolupráci s neziskovkami, které by měly adekvátní kandidáty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jan Meissner z Mews dostal nápad posunout to někam dál, takže jsme nakonec sestavili celý balík věcí, které bychom byli schopni poskytnout, našel-li by se někdo vhodný. Kurz programování, členství v klubu, online výuku angličtiny, návštěvu reálné softwarové firmy. S Janem jsme si hodně sedli a ani u jednoho z nás nejde o to, že bychom si na tom chtěli dělat nějaké promo, nebo třeba já, že bych na tom něco měl rejžovat. Upřímně, je pro mě mnohem jednodušší ty jednotky ročních členství v klubu vydělat úplně standardní cestou a nevkládat tolik úsilí a energie do nějakého stipendia. Oba to děláme fakt proto, že prostě chceme někomu pomoct. Strašně se mi líbí &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GVEIfw-qd4"&gt;tento webinář pro JA Czech&lt;/a&gt;, kde vysvětluje svoji motivaci Jan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na základní stipendium jsem před pár týdny konečně udělal formulář na Google Forms a spustil jej na webu jako třetí možnost zaplacení členství dole na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/club/"&gt;stránce klubu&lt;/a&gt;. Zatím jsem zprocesoval dvě žádosti. Nedělal jsem tomu žádné promo, podle mě můj marketing neoslovuje cílovku toho stipendia. Musel bych to prostě poslat někam do neziskovek a vysvětlit jim to. S několika jsem v minulosti mluvil a většinou vůbec nechápou, co dělám. Jsou rádi, že tuší, že IT existuje, ale u toho to tak nějak končí. Takhle ale můžu aspoň chytit nějaké náhodné lidi, kteří JG objeví sami a které bych ani nikdy přes žádnou neziskovku nenašel. Přesně jednoho takového jsem už na to lapil a do klubu ho pustil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na to nabušenější stipendium s Mews jsme vytvořili něco jako letáček, kde jsme popsali, co vlastně nabízíme, abychom to mohli rozšířit mezi neziskovky a např. dětské domovy, apod. Dokonce jsem se sešel se známým Dana Srba, který se v tomto oboru přímo pohybuje, dával nám na letáček zpětnou vazbu a bylo to celé velmi poučné. Nicméně pak nebylo tolik času se tomu věnovat a hlavně jsme si uvědomili, že naše stipendium je obtížné nabízet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Je potřeba, aby člověk, který stipendium dostane, měl sám dost zájmu a vnitřní motivace. Všechno, co jsme schopni nabídnout, jsou totiž samoobslužné věci, které je schopný využít jen někdo s vnitřní motivací, koho nerozhodí, že si to musí sám naplánovat, mít chuť a disciplínu se tomu věnovat, uhlídat si to. To jsou věci, které nezvládají dospělí z komfortu běžného domova, natož např. dospívající z dětského domova. Sehnat vedení &lt;em&gt;in-house&lt;/em&gt; je složité, vychovatelé apod. většinou moc velký vztah k IT nemají, nerozumí tomu. Vedení a nějaký „školní“ systém ale nabídnout schopni nejsme, není to v našich silách. Nabízíme zaplacení příležitostí, jak něčeho dosáhnout. Navíc to není nějaký mega program, nekropíme to penězi, umíme podpořit jednotky lidí. Byla by škoda, kdyby z té podpory nic nebylo, nemůžeme mít velký „odpad“ těch, kteří stipendium dostanou, ale vůbec nikam to nedotáhnou. A ani jeden s něčím takovým nemáme zkušenosti a děláme to pouze z nadšení.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takže na tom jsme se zasekli. Kde najít vhodné pilotní kandidáty? A pak se mi do ruky dostalo díky Lumírovi Balharovi a Pyvec Slacku PDF o klukovi, který by naše požadavky splňoval úplně ideálně. No a během těchto týdnů jsme měli spolu s klukem a jeho rodiči pár video callů, kde jsme si vše domluvili. Je fajn, když teď mají děcka běžně aspoň ty MS Teams a umí s nimi pracovat. Jsem zvědav, jak to dopadne a co se na tom naučíme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="clanek"&gt;Článek&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#clanek" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pro &lt;a href="https://www.heroine.cz/"&gt;Heroine.cz&lt;/a&gt; jsem &lt;a href="https://www.heroine.cz/clanky/autor/70000223-honza-javorek"&gt;napsal 4 články&lt;/a&gt;, ale domluvených bylo 5. &lt;a href="https://www.heroine.cz/zeny-it"&gt;Projekt o ženách v IT&lt;/a&gt; pokračuje v novém designu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Témata mých článků se v průběhu zamíchala, protože jsme si něco prohodili se &lt;a href="https://www.heroine.cz/clanky/autor/70000224-zuzana-pechova"&gt;Zuzanou&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kayla_eilhart/"&gt;Kaylou&lt;/a&gt; a pátý &lt;em&gt;slot&lt;/em&gt; na článek zůstal bez jasného tématu. Šéfredaktorka mi nabídla, že za to, co všechno jsem pro projekt udělal, to můžu pojmout prostě jako PR článek a udělat si na JG reklamu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenže já nikdy nic jako PR článek nepsal, já píšu návody a jsem celkem skromný člověk, který se za své úspěchy nestydí, ale nerad by je cpal do obličeje nic netušícímu návštěvníkovi časopisu. Takže skvělá příležitost, ale pro mě nejhorší možné zadání: Napiš si co chceš, o sobě a svém projektu. Takže jsem psaní článku dlouho prokrastinoval, až přišlo to, co přijít jednou muselo: „Mohl bys to prosím dodat do konce týdne?“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radil jsem se s lidmi v klubu, jak to mám pojmout. Nejčastější návrhy byly něco jako osobní zpověď, nebo zpovídat členy klubu, aby to vychvalování řekli za mě. Na to už jsem ale neměl zas tolik času, ten jsem ztratil měsícem a půl odsouvání práce na článku. Takže nezbývalo, než to nějak vykutit za pár dní.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Výsledkem je 10.000 znaků jakéhosi slepence osobní zpovědi, reklamy a textu, který lidem promlouvá do duše. Tři pracovní dny a jeden státní svátek jsem se to číslo snažil dostat dolů a přepisoval jsem text stále dokola, aby mi dával aspoň nějaký smysl a byl tam aspoň náznak pointy. V určitý okamžik jsem vzdal investovat do toho ještě víc času a taky už jsem si potřeboval připravit přednášku na Pyvo, takže jsem to odevzdal a děj se vůle editorky. Je to můj snad nejvydřenější a nejutrápenější článek vůbec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="prednaska-svetlany"&gt;Přednáška Svetlany&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#prednaska-svetlany" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Přednášky v klubu zůstaly tak trochu na mrtvém bodě, protože jsem měl v březnu dovolenou a nedomlouval nové, pak jsem na to neměl čas a ještě mi v tom udělal guláš jeden speaker, s nímž se mi nedařilo najít efektivní způsob domluvy termínu a přípravy proma přednášky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zachránila mě &lt;a href="https://kompilator.cz/"&gt;Svetlana Margetová&lt;/a&gt;, která aniž by věděla o mé situaci s přednáškovým kalendářem, nabídla se připravit si přednášku o Next.js. Viděla totiž lidi v klubu, jak to používají, ale vlastně nevědí, jak využít všechny fičury, které Next.js nabízí a k čemu je to vlastně nejvíc dobré.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Svetlana už je ostřílená členka klubu a jednu přednášku měla nedávno, takže příprava byla super efektivní a po třech vyměněných zprávách už byla přednáška v kalendáři. Poprvé se tím pádem zopakoval speaker, ale myslím, že to mělo dobré důvody. Je hlavně fakt super, že to vzešlo přímo takhle z potřeb členů klubu a nabídla se sama seniorka z klubu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Měl bych nicméně zapracovat na domluvě dalších přednášek, pověnovat se tomu a nasázet talky co dva týdny na pár měsíců dopředu, ať mám pak chvíli zase klídek. Nebo si v tom najít nějakou rutinu, těžko říct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Přednáška se Svetlanou proběhla skvěle. Vše mi fungovalo, počítač jsem měl v elektřině, sluchátka nabitá, nahrávání nahrávalo, zvuk zvučel. Sveťa si stěžovala na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/speaker/"&gt;zrcadlo&lt;/a&gt;, což je můj hack toho, že Discord nepodporuje více jak 25 lidí na video callu. Hack sice funguje, ale jak Sveťa, tak Nela z toho byly spíš rozladěné a video se na záznamu z nějakého důvodu seká. Navíc i když bylo na event nakliknutých skoro 30 lidí, nakonec jich nepřišlo víc než 25, takže to mohl být klidně video call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Přemýšlím, jak by to šlo řešit a nejvíc se klaním k tomu, že bych se naučil streamovat přednášku na YouTube. Pak by šlo o standadní video call a kdyby byl náhodou příliš populární (stalo se asi 2x) a do callu by se někdo nevešel, mohl by jít sledovat aspoň stream na YouTube. Otázky může přes chat na Discordu pokládat, to není problém. Mě by se zároveň (zřejmě?) zjednodušilo pořizování záznamu v tom smyslu, že bych pak nemusel po přednášce nahrávat soubor na YouTube, ale už by tam byl (záznamy nestříhám).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="prednaska-moje"&gt;Přednáška moje&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#prednaska-moje" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Přípravě na Pyvo jsem kvůli psaní článku a Svetině přednášce nemohl věnovat moc času. Po covidu jsem na obnoveném Pyvu ještě nebyl, takže jsem se těšil, že uvidím staré dobré kamarády, ale přednáška mě trochu stresovala. Zase jsem měl radost, že mě sami organizátoři pozvali a že pozvali i Páju, aby měla &lt;em&gt;lightning talk&lt;/em&gt;, takže z toho bude takový JG svátek a velké připomenutí místní Python komunitě, že projekt existuje (a že existuje i díky nim). Na Pyvo jsem donesl i dost samolepek, které jsem mohl konečně rozdávat lidem a ne je pouze lepit někde po záchodech v hospodách a na lampy před brněnskými kavárnami.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aktuální pravidla na Pyvu praví, že pokud přijde někdo, kdo nerozumí česky, mělo by se přednášet anglicky. Což bych neměl mít problém, ale při přípravě jsem zjistil, že aby to mělo v angličtině nějaký spád, musel bych si to prostě připravovat déle, klidně i několik dní. Že se s lidmi u piva klidně anglicky pobavím a okecám to, ale takhle při přednášce se odvázat už neumím a strašně nad tím přemýšlím, takže to musí být trochu naučené a tak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na přípravu mi zbylo odpoledne před akcí, takže jsem měl fakt velký stres. Během oběda jsem si udělal osnovu toho, co chci říct a pak jsem ji v podstatě jen přepsal do &lt;a href="https://speakerdeck.com/honzajavorek/how-and-why-i-work-on-junior-dot-guru"&gt;slajdů&lt;/a&gt;, na každém jedno slovo jako připomínka toho, o čem chci mluvit. Graficky jsem se s tím nepatlal, prostě jsem tam prdnul jedno emoji a texty udělal černé na bílém v &lt;a href="https://github.com/hotovec/rapid-arrows-font"&gt;Rapid Arrows&lt;/a&gt;, dodělal nějaké předěly s kuřetem a bublinou, která jde nakreslit přímo v Keynote, no a bylo hotovo. Celé to trvalo asi hodinu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zbytek jsem měl na zkoušení talku, přičemž za první hodinu zkoušení jsem se dostal na 10. slajd z 60, takže celkem tragédie. Na Pyvo jsem jel dost vystresovaný, ale naštěstí jsem potkal po cestě kamarády, se kterými jsem mohl kecat. Nejvíc se mi ale ulevilo, když jsem přišel se zpožděním do sálu a viděl, že borec od Průši bude přednášet česky. To ze mě pak spadla veškerá tréma a věděl jsem, že to dám. Od té chvíle už to byla jízda, kterou jsem si strašně užil. Potlesk ohromný, vypadalo to, že se lidi bavili. Pája mě &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1517091165014740992"&gt;vyfotila&lt;/a&gt;, jak nevědomky dělám Vincenta z Pulp Fiction, kterého mám na tričku. Lidi mě pak zasypali dotazy a i dlouho po přednášce jsem v konverzacích řešil JG a juniory, takže některé staré kámoše jsem pozdravil jen mávnutím, až když šli domů.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Já jsem domů dorazil ve 4, na čemž je nejhorší to, že dítě se neptá, kdy jsem šel spát, dítě mě prostě vzbudí v 7 nebo v 8. Čtvrtek nebyl úplně &lt;em&gt;fresh&lt;/em&gt;, ale klasicky jsem šel do &lt;a href="https://www.kafeatrium.cz/"&gt;Atria&lt;/a&gt;. Sešli jsme se dokonce s Josefem Rouskem na krátký cowork (viz &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/josefrousek/status/1517092383560806401"&gt;foto&lt;/a&gt;) a během dne jsem řešil maily, sociální sítě a klub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="konec-marketingu"&gt;„Konec marketingu“&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#konec-marketingu" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Po posledním článku pro Heroine a přednášce na Pyvu bych chtěl teď šlápnout na brzdu co se týče marketingu. Je důležité dělat projektu promo, ale mám už dojem, že toho teď bylo dost a je potřeba si zase vyhrnout rukávy a napsat konečně nějaké nové texty do příručky, nebo něco naprogramovat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lidi do klubu chodí, firmy o mě ví, takže akutní problém to není. Co jsem udělal za posledního půl roku, bude mít ještě nějakou setrvačnost. Navíc mi vyhovuje, když lidi chodí postupně a ne když jich přijde 10 za dopoledne. Finanční výsledky &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;pomalu rostou&lt;/a&gt;, takže věřím, že i když nebudu teď ze všech sil bušit marketing, tak se časem na vysněných 40.000 Kč měsíčně čistého dostanu. (A věřím, že nám nezvýší zálohy na plyn tak, že to číslo nebudu muset posunout výš.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nejefektivnější jsou pro mě návštěvy podcastů, protože se na to nemusím skoro vůbec připravovat, jde to sfouknout i přes online call, publikum je dobře zacílené a některé podcasty mají třeba i tisíce pravidelných posluchačů, což je paráda. Pyvo je důležité pro ten osobní kontakt, ale i když bude plné, bude tam třeba 70 lidí, kteří mě uslyší a mám velký stres s přípravou. U přednášek na konferencích je to podobné. Takže do přednášek se teď hrnout nebudu. Podcasty nechám, to mě nic moc nestojí.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Přihlásil jsem si ještě &lt;em&gt;lightning talk&lt;/em&gt; do CfP jedné plánované konference pro komunitní manažery, ale to je 5minutová sranda. A je domluvené, že uspořádám Q&amp;amp;A call pro PyLadies (možná se na tom zkusím naučit to streamování na YouTube, ještě uvidím), ale to jde bez velké přípravy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jinak nic nového vyhledávat nebudu, především nic náročného, jako je psaní článků nebo „velké“ přednášení. Do odvolání, samozřejmě ne navždy, protože marketing je potřeba, ale myslím, že bych teď v tomto směru mohl mít na půl roku nebo na rok odmakáno. A jasně, kdyby se naskytla nějaká fakt velká příležitost, je otázka, zda bych odolal. Nabídka, jako přišla z Heroine, že pro ně můžu psát, to se těžko plánuje nebo odmítá, a tím spíš, pokud to dává velký smysl z hlediska cílovky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Snažil jsem se najít speakerky na Python meetup v Namibii, ale nakonec jsem nikoho nenašel. Zprvu nebyly úplně jasné instrukce, pak už to zase bylo dost narychlo, navíc byly Velikonoce a hodně lidí mělo už jiné plány. Meetupy budou pokračovat a přemýšlíme s &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/jessica-upani-about-python-events-in-namibia-you-have-to-be-pure-in-terms-of-your-why/"&gt;Jessicou&lt;/a&gt;, že zkusíme sehnat speakery z Česka aspoň na nějaké ty další. Příští bude někdy v květnu nebo červnu. Pokud byste měli zájem podpořit jednu strašně milou komunitu v Africe, připravit si pro ně přednášku a připojit se za nimi přes MS Teams, ozvěte se mi prosím.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doplnil jsem do kódu nějaké testy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Povedlo se nám díky Anežce Müller domluvit společný call, kde starý výbor Pyvce předá moc nově zvolenému výboru Pyvce. Měl by proběhnout dnes večer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domlouvám s Engeto naši další spolupráci.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;O velikonocích jsme si užívali rodinnou pohodu a prázdnou Prahu. Pátek jsem nedodržel jako státní svátek, psal jsem článek pro Heroine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domluvil jsem s &lt;a href="https://lynt.cz/"&gt;Lynt&lt;/a&gt; prodloužení jejich členství v klubu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domlouval jsem svou účast v podcastu &lt;a href="https://restarty.dev/"&gt;(re)štarty v IT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software Development Academy mi potvrdila vyúčtované studenty, které mi naposílali do klubu a jejichž první 3 měsíce v klubu platí, takže jsem poslal fakturu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Juicymo prodloužilo své &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/jobs/"&gt;nabídky práce na JG&lt;/a&gt;, tak jsem se jich zkusil zeptat, jak jim to tam vlastně vyhovuje a jestli přes to chodí nějací použitelní kandidáti.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kamarád mi předal svatební oznámení s QR kódem. Ten vedl na web. Tam bylo, že mám nainstalovat appku do mobilu a z ní dostat kód, který dokud nevložím, tak se o svatbě nic nedozvím. Appka byla hra, plošinovka ve stylu Super Mario, kde jsem měl sbírat písmenka ze jmen novomanželů a na konci porazit bosse a dostat kód. Boží, se ženou jsme to pařili jeden celý večer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psal jsem si se StartupJobs o tom, jakým způsobem bychom mohli spolupracovat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na Discordu nám vypršel boost klubu, takže jsem zaplatil nový.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Objevil jsem &lt;a href="https://lookscanned.io/"&gt;lookscanned.io&lt;/a&gt;. Spolu s MojeID, eIdentitou a datovou schránkou jsem teď neporazitelný digitální občan!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strhla se mi platba za televizi Skylink, kde jsem sledoval záznam velké ceny Austrálie F1. Chtěl jsem to zrušit, protože mi nevyhovovali komentátoři, s tím, že si předplatím přímo F1 TV, ale tak když už se to strhlo, tak to mám teda zaplacené hned na další dvě nebo tři velké ceny (1 měsíc), tož na to holt asi budu koukat tam.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Propagoval jsem &lt;a href="https://rozbiteprasatko.cz/epizoda40/"&gt;díl Rozbitého prasátka&lt;/a&gt;, který vyšel se mnou jako hostem a kde má vstup i člen klubu a „IT noob“ &lt;a href="https://itnoob.cz/"&gt;Pavel Polcr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Procházel jsem klub, vítal nové lidi, zapojoval se do debat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Propagoval jsem Svetinu přednášku a to, že budu na Pyvu. Nový díl JG podcastu jsem zpropagovat už nezvládl, udělám v pondělí. Kdo ale podcast odebíráte, tak už jste díl dávno slyšeli, vychází to vždy patnáctého, žejo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chtěl jsem do příručky přidat stránku o psychickém zdraví, kterou vytvoříme spolu s Nelou Slezákovou, psycholožkou z klubu. Měli jsme si zavolat, ale posunul jsem to, protože jsem nic nevytvořil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Propojil jsem Pavlínu z JG podcastu s Vojtou a Šárkou z ProgramHRování, takže se můžete těšit na díl podcastu o ní.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 14 dní od 9.4. do 22.4. jsem naběhal 8 km, při procházkách nachodil 21 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 13 hodin a zdolal při tom 29 kilometrů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aktuální finanční výsledky, návštěvnost a další čísla k JG &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;mám přímo na webu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tři věci, které bych chtěl zvládnout udělat příště:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Připravit stránku do příručky o psychologické pohodě,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;naplánovat nové přednášky a zkusit streamování na YouTube,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;zpropagovat nový díl podcastu a naučit bota v klubu ty díly oznamovat za mě.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-co-vy"&gt;A co vy?&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#a-co-vy" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud byste čistě náhodou měli dojem, že jste oproti mě za uplynulý týden vůbec nic nestihli, tak mám pro vás skvělou zprávu! V klidu se na ten dojem &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/neni-to-zavod/"&gt;můžete vykašlat&lt;/a&gt;. Není zač!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hurá! Páteční poznámky konečně v pátek! To, že minulý týden vůbec nevyšly, toho si nebudeme všímat, že ne? :) Ale teď vážně:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="psani-poznamek"&gt;Psaní poznámek&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#psani-poznamek" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zamyslel jsem se nad tím, zda chci poznámky stále ještě psát. Hlavní důvod, proč jsem je psát začal, byl, abych si v pátek uvědomil, kolik jsem toho stihl, a neměl blbý pocit, že jsem nic nestihl. Abych si před víkendem vyčistil hlavu. To se ovšem časem, i díky poznámkám, spravilo a tyto pocity teď nemívám. Našel jsem si v práci rytmus, a to nejen v kalendáři a domácnosti, ale i ve své hlavě. Postupně jsem se dopracoval k několika zvykům, které mi pomáhají s pracovním týdnem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Administrativu dělám v pondělky a středy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Postování na sociální sítě jsem sladil s administrativními dny, tedy chtěl bych to dělat v pondělky a ve středy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Úterky, čtvrtky a pátky dělám soustředěnou práci.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pracuji z domova, ale ve čtvrtky chodím do &lt;a href="https://www.kafeatrium.cz/"&gt;Atria&lt;/a&gt;, abych měl nové podněty a doma mi nehráblo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;O víkendu si nezakazuji chodit na Discord, ale čtu a píšu pouze do kanálu „volná zábava“, nezabývám se zbytkem (tzn. prací).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Také dítě začalo lozit, tak jsme o víkendu přestěhovali mé pracovní místo z obýváku do ložnice, za dveře. Zatím to funguje dobře, navíc dveře se dají nechat otevřené, pokud chci zachovat kontakt se světem a nebráním se návštěvám, nebo zavřené, pokud chci klid a soukromí (stejný trik nám fungoval kdysi na studentském bytě s kamarády).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rozhodl jsem se, že poznámky nechci přestat psát. Jednak mi to pořád pomáhá uspořádat si myšlenky. Jako rituál se mi to líbí. Je to transparentní. Občas se do nich dívám jako do archivu, do deníčku. A je to dobrý marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poznámkám ale chybí „zvyk“ a s ním i rytmus a píšu je pak se zpožděním, dlouho a v náhodné dny. Zkusím tedy přidat do seznamu nový bod:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ať už hodlám v pátek dělat cokoliv, první věc, kterou z pracovních záležitostí udělám, bude sepsání a publikace poznámek.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dokonceni-robota-na-pracovni-inzeraty"&gt;Dokončení robota na pracovní inzeráty&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dokonceni-robota-na-pracovni-inzeraty" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bylo to už na spadnutí, no konečně jsem to dodělal. Už zbývalo poladit jen pár blbin ohledně spouštění všeho na CI, nějaké cachování a tak, ale pak už se to rozjelo. Obří Pull Request jsem mergnul s tím, že sice nemá moc testů a ještě spousta je toho potřeba dodělat, ale už se nutně potřebuji posunout na další úkoly, odpočinout si od toho po několika měsících a vrátit se ke &lt;em&gt;continuous delivery&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To, co mám, jsem vyhodnotil za lepší, než to, co je na produkci, takže proč to nemergnout, že? Udělal jsem si Trello kartičky na věci, které chci pak ještě dodělat. Hlavně musím vrátit zpátky do codebase spoustu testů. Zatím to funguje a jsem s tím spokojený. Nejviditelnější změnou navenek je, že se stahují nabídky práce z více zdrojů.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Po tom, co jsem to konečně mergnul, tak jsem počkal, jestli vše funguje, a potom jsem na JG upgradoval spoustu knihoven, které jsem do té chvíle upgradovat kvůli merge konfliktům nechtěl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V jeden den se objevila chyba, kterou jsem nepochopil a neměl jsem čas ji odladit a zjistit příčinu. Nechal jsem to na další den, ale to už se neprojevila a ani nikdy potom. Tak nevím, jestli erupce na slunci, ale zatím jsem se na to tedy vykašlal a budu to řešit, až když se objeví znovu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vitani-firem-v-klubu"&gt;Vítání firem v klubu&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#vitani-firem-v-klubu" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nové členy v klubu vítáme, ale firmy jsme dostatečně nevítali. Občas jsem nové partnery v klubu oznámil, ale bylo to nekonzistentní a netransparentní a vůbec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V rámci plánu zviditelnit firmy v rámci klubu jsem vytvořil skript, který firmy v klubu automaticky vítá. Děje se to v kanálu „ahoj“, kde se představují i lidi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bylo by jednoduché udělat skript, který prostě oznámí novou firmu v okamžiku, kdy s nimi uzavřu partnerství a přidám si je do tabulky, ale to by jaksi pominulo těch zhruba 15 firem, které už klub dávno sponzorují. Takže jsem to udělal inteligentnější.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Umí to vítat firmy i zpětně. Neoznamuje firmy častěji než jednou týdně. Bere to od firem, kterým brzo vyprší členství, aby je to stihlo uvítat dřív, než budeme jednat o prodloužení. Pak pojede od nejnovějších firem po nejstarší. Až vyplýtvá zásobník, bude firmy vítat už prostě tehdy, kdy se nějaká objeví, nebo kdy to bude víc jak rok od posledního vítání.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lidi z každé firmy mají už z dřívějška automaticky roli, skrze kterou je lze označit. Toho ve vítačce využívám, aby lidem z firmy přišla notifikace, že je bot vítá. Když bot (který se jmenuje „kuře“) vítá nějakou firmu, která sponzoruje už déle, přídá se navíc věta, která to vysvětluje:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="figure figure-blockquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;👋 Kamarádi z &lt;strong&gt;Inuits&lt;/strong&gt; se rozhodli podpořit klub a jsou tady s námi! Mají roli &lt;strong&gt;@Firma: Inuits&lt;/strong&gt;. 🐣 Sice to píšu jako novinku, ale ve skutečnosti klub podporují už od 2.4.2021. Jenže tehdy jsem bylo malé kuřátko, které ještě neumělo vítat firmy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;K tomu je ještě Discord „embed“ s informacemi o partnerství, odkazem na firmu a obrázkem. Obrázek využívám ten, který už si dávno generuju ke každé firmě pro účely oznamování na sociálních sítích.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="efektivni-stahovani-avataru"&gt;Efektivní stahování avatarů&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#efektivni-stahovani-avataru" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/club/"&gt;stránce klubu&lt;/a&gt; nahoře je vždy pár náhodných avatarů. Pokaždé se stránka vygeneruje s jinými. Avatary se stahují z Discordu a původně se tak dělo pro všechny členy klubu. Kdo měl avatar, tam se avatar stáhl a až potom se náhodně vybralo těch pár, které se zobrazí.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V klubu je teď ale už přes 350 lidí, takže skript s avatary začal trvat nesmyslně dlouho na to, že jde jen o kravinu, která ústí v pár obrázků pro větší důvěryhodnost klubové stránky. Nechce se mi to teď hledat přesně, ale bylo to třeba něco jako 5 minut a to je teda dost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takže jsem to přepsal tak, aby se vzali všichni členové, zamíchali do náhodného pořadí a pak se z nich berou „dávky“ po třeba deseti. Tyto dávky se vždy paralelně postahují, čímž se zjistí, kolik avatarů se reálně stáhlo (spousta lidí žádný avatar nemá, nebo se jej kvůli síťovému problému nemusí povést stáhnout a byla by škoda skript nechat spadnout jen kvůli tomu). Po každé dávce se vyhodnotí, jestli už mám dost avatarů, třeba 30, a když jo, tak se skončí.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teď ten skript trvá 0.4min.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vyuctovani-studentu"&gt;Vyúčtování studentů&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#vyuctovani-studentu" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Klub sponzorují dvě vzdělávací agentury, SDA a Engeto. Máme dohodu, že budou své (vybrané) studenty posílat do klubu. Student dostane 3 měsíce klubu zdarma jako bonusovou službu v rámci studia a agentura mi ty 3 měsíce proplatí.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sliboval jsem si od toho hodně, ale u jedné agentury se to zatím ani moc nerozjelo a u druhé se to rozjíždělo pomalu. Ale pak se to rozjelo dost a nějak mě zaskočilo, kolik toho bylo. Zjistil jsem, že nejsem schopen to snadno vyúčtovat, že na to potřebuji nějaké skripty a způsob, jak si u lidí poznačit, že už jsem je fakturoval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na ten jsem už dřív nějak přišel, díky podpoře Memberful jsem zjistil, že ke členům klubu si můžu něco uložit přes API do políčka &lt;code&gt;metadata&lt;/code&gt;, i když to bohužel nepůjde nijak vidět v administraci. Vymyslel jsem tedy jak bude probíhat procesně fakturace studentů a napsal jsem si skript, který zjistí, koho je potřeba fakturovat a vytvoří mi seznam. Ten mohu poslat agentuře a když si to potvrdíme, skriptem lidi označím jako fakturované.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fakturu bych mohl vytvořit přes API, ale zatím jsem to nechal ručně, ono to nebude asi zas tak často.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když jsem pracoval na tomto skriptu, přeuspořádal jsem složky a soubory i kolem dalších skriptů. Přišlo mi, že se mi &lt;a href="https://www.pyinvoke.org/"&gt;invoke&lt;/a&gt; líbí méně a méně, protože mám tasků hodně a potřebuji si je různě organizovat do balíčků a potom mi přístup invoke přijde dost nepřehledný a magický. Zabránil jsem si zatím to přepsat celé do &lt;a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/"&gt;click&lt;/a&gt;u, ale jednou to asi udělám.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zarovnavani-clenstvi-firem-a-lidi-z-techto-firem"&gt;Zarovnávání členství firem a lidí z těchto firem&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#zarovnavani-clenstvi-firem-a-lidi-z-techto-firem" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když jsem některým firmám prodával firemní partnerství, tedy členství v klubu, pozval jsem občas lidi od nich do klubu, aby si to okoukli, a až potom jsme rozjeli firemní roční předplatné. Jenže to teď začalo vytvářet problém. Lidem začalo končit jejich roční členství, ačkoliv firma má třeba ještě několik měsíců členství.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Přemýšlel jsem, jak to budu řešit, protože kupóny jsou na rok a lidi prostě dostanou kupón. A ten má svůj začátek a konec, který není nijak synchronizovaný s členstvím samotné firmy. Už jsem myslel, že to půjde dost složitě, až jsem si v administraci Memberful všiml, že mohu ručně editovat konec členství lidí. Mohu jej ručně natáhnout, jak potřebuji.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A to byl už jen krůček k tomu, abych vytvořil skript, který lidem z firem, kterým by členství končilo dřív, než skončí to firemní, natáhne členství tak, aby se to srovnalo. To elegantně řeší problém a dokonce to elegantně řeší i to, čeho jsem se trochu bál, a to jak budu jednotlivým lidem prodlužovat firemní předplatné, když firma své členství prodlouží. Takhle se automaticky prodlouží samo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pouze potřebuji do budoucna vyřešit způsob, jak označit lidi, kterým se prodloužit firemní členství nemá, protože např. z firmy odešli, nebo jej chce firma dát někomu jinému.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Viděl jsem se konečně poprvé v životě naživo s &lt;a href="https://blog.python.cz/ja-python-a-rosti"&gt;Markem z Hradce&lt;/a&gt;, který měl cestu do Prahy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na sociálních sítích jsem propagoval &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/podcast/"&gt;nový díl našeho podcastu s Filipem z Appliftingu&lt;/a&gt; a svou &lt;a href="https://www.programhrovani.cz/1843229/10212890-o-prvni-praci-v-it-s-honzou-javorkem"&gt;účast v podcastu ProgramHRování&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/podcast/"&gt;stránku našeho podcastu&lt;/a&gt; jsem přidal děkovací větu o tom, kdo nám na míru složil znělku.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Podal jsem přes datovku daňové přiznání.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ozvala se mi &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/jessica-upani-about-python-events-in-namibia-you-have-to-be-pure-in-terms-of-your-why/"&gt;Jessica&lt;/a&gt;, jestli nevím o vhodných speakerkách pro jejich meetup, tak jsem se pokusil nějaké dohodit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volali jsme si s Nelou a dohodli &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/6G4TKGQICw0"&gt;zveřejnění přednášky&lt;/a&gt; a ladili podobu nové stránky na JG, která se bude zabývat psychickým zdravím. Dělali jsme hlavně několik koleček revize budoucího textu. Přednášku jsem následně propagoval na sociálních sítích a upravoval jsem kód stránek, aby se dal zvlášť evidovat veřejný a klubový odkaz na video, protože tato přednáška má dvě verze (v klubovém záznamu je navíc záverečná diskuze s členy).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uzavřeli jsme partnerství spolu s STRV a Pure Storage. Ladíme detaily a rozjíždíme dohodnuté věci.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proběhly volby do rady &lt;a href="https://pyvec.org/"&gt;Pyvce&lt;/a&gt; a zvolili mě :) Zůstávají dva původní členové výboru, tři budou noví. Paráda! Čerstvá krev! Aktuálně probíhá pomalé „předávání moci”. Podílel jsem se hodně na oživení spolku před pěti lety a jsem rád, že jsme to dotáhli až k volbám a tomu, že si spolek přebírá nová generace :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prošel jsem dosavadní žádosti o stipendium a vyhodnotil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volal jsem si s kamarádem z Red Hatu a bavili jsme se o tom, jak by mohli členství v klubu využívat víc naplno.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ozvala se šéfredaktorka z Heroine, jestli dodám poslední článek. Tak asi budu muset dodat. V klubu jsem otevřel brainstorming o tom, jak ten článek pojmout, protože jsem nikdy nic takového nepsal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Předělal jsem, jak v kódu importuju modely z balíčku. Je to teď víc psaní, ale je to jednodušší na přemýšlení a taky ty importy teď dokáže snadno napovídat editor. Protože po této změně byl v importech trochu nepořádek, doinstaloval jsem &lt;code&gt;isort&lt;/code&gt;, nakonfiguroval a jednorázově importy nechal uspořádat. Zatím platí, že se neplánuji zdržovat lintery nebo formátovači kódu, isort bude jen na jednorázové použití „na přání“, až se mi zase bude zdát, že je v tom moc binec.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Komunikoval jsem s autorkou dalšího podcastu, kde bych mohl vystupovat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kontaktoval jsem dvě firmy, kterým bude brzo končit členství v klubu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slíbil jsem organizátorům &lt;a href="https://pyvo.cz/praha-pyvo/"&gt;pražského Pyva&lt;/a&gt;, že na příštím srazu budu přednášet o JG. To budou zas nervy, ajaj! Možná přijde i Pája a udělá si &lt;em&gt;lightning talk&lt;/em&gt; na JG podcast. Dodal jsem organizátorům detaily k přednášce a do svého kalendáře jsem si rozplánoval přípravu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vyřídil jsem až příliš mnoho emailů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vedl jsem diskuzi s člověkem, který z klubu odešel, protože tam nenašel, co chtěl. Bylo to zajímavé a poučné, ale taky zas nemůžu prostě řešit problém všem. Měl specifické požadavky, jasné zaměření (užší než je zaměření klubu) a křehkou trpělivost. Naučil jsem se na tom aspoň správně s takovými lidmi komunikovat, abych zjistil, proč odešli, a abychom se rozešli v dobrém.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aktualizoval jsem na webu logo Software Development Academy na novou verzi, kterou teď mají. Konečně SVG!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přemýšlel jsem, zda a jaký smysl mají v klubu úzce zaměřené kanály na jednotlivé technologie, které spíš zejí prázdnotou, protože lidi většinou vyřeší co potřebují v obecnějších kanálech. Jasné závěry nemám, mít tam takové kanály má svá pro i proti.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zjistil jsem, že se mi na CI nestahují obrázky (loga firem) z exportu od StartupJobs. Doma jo. Šťoural jsem do toho a zjistil, že obrázky leží za nějakým Cloudflare, kde je asi zapnutá ochrana proti robotům nebo DDoS. Chvíli jsem to zkoušel obejít, ale pak jsem se na to vykašlal a napsal jim e-mail. Když je to export, tedy API, asi by mělo fungovat stahování obrázků, považuji to za bug :) Tak uvidíme, jestli to někdy spraví, nebo to budu muset časem vyřešit jinak.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Našli jsme kluka, kterého chceme spolu s Mews podpořit v rámci speciálního stipendia. Bude to takový pilotní pokus. Volal jsem si s jejich rodiči a je to idální případ na to, co jsme chtěli dělat. Teď se snažíme domluvit další call, kde bychom klukovi věci předali a ještě víc se seznámili, ale byl nemocný, tak se to posunulo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upgradoval jsem knihovny na projektech Pyvce, což tentorkát zahrnovalo i nějaké změny v kódu. Když jsem byl u toho, upgradoval jsem toho víc a &lt;a href="https://github.com/pyvec/pyvec.org/commit/fe3d0fe60cf1498b34edb193d4e8553500013869"&gt;změnil&lt;/a&gt;, jak se v kódu webu &lt;a href="https://pyvec.org/"&gt;pyvec.org&lt;/a&gt; pracuje se závislostma.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volal jsem si se starým známým z firmy, která možná bude sponzorovat klub.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Věnoval jsem se lidem v klubu, vítal nové členy, zapojoval se do diskuzí. Také jsem napsal pár tradičním členům, kteří už třeba mají práci a nezvládají tolik přispívat, soukromé zprávy, abych se zeptal, jak se mají. Nebylo to nic moc plánovaného, prostě jsem měl chuť se s nimi po delší době spojit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 14 dní od 26.3. do 8.4. jsem při procházkách nachodil 53 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 18 hodin a zdolal při tom 53 kilometrů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aktuální finanční výsledky, návštěvnost a další čísla k JG &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;mám přímo na webu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tři věci, které bych chtěl zvládnout udělat příště:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Napsat článek pro Heroine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domlouvat přednášky v klubu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Připravit si přednášku na Pyvo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tak tentokrát zase po delší době. Říkal jsem si, že napíšu poznámky až těsně před dovolenou. To jsem nestihl. Po dovolené zas bylo pořád co dělat, takže nakonec to píšu až dnes. Vím, že to slibuju v poslední době pokaždé, ale polepším se! Chtěl bych se nějak fakt vrátit k týdennímu rytmu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="robot-na-nabidky-prace"&gt;Robot na nabídky práce&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#robot-na-nabidky-prace" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jak jsem psal dříve, jsem teď v procesu překopávání robota na stahování nabídek práce, protože jsem na něm dlouhodobě neřešil různé nedostatky a postupně to celé uhnilo, až se to jednoho dne prostě rozpadlo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Těžko říct, zda tady detailně popisovat vše, co jsem na tom udělal a jaké myšlenkové pochody se mi při tom honily hlavou. Zkusím to nějak stručně, ale i tak, jde o skoro měsíc práce:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navrhoval jsem nové modely. Nakonec mám zvlášť modely pro nabídky stažené odjinud a nabídky zadané na samotném JG. Pak mám ještě třetí model, který se tvoří z těch dvou a slouží pro nabídky, které se mají zobrazit na webu, případně na Discordu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Z rozdělení modelů na několik a jednotlivých skriptů na spoustu oddělených fází jsem zatím nadšený. Je teď mnohem jasnější, kdy se má co dít a je to i efektivnější, protože se věci mohou dít jen tehdy a jen pro ta data, kdy to má nějaký význam. Je rozdíl, jestli spouštím geolokaci nebo stahování obrázků pro 300 nabídek, nebo jen pro těch 30, které nakonec chci zobrazit na webu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do robota jsem vrátil vyhodnocování juniornosti nabídky. To se dělá přes spoustu regulárních výrazů a jednou by to měl dělat machine learning, ale zatím jsem se snažil jen překlopit to, co bylo, do nové architektury a nesahat na to moc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Změnil a zjednodušil jsem řazení nabídek práce na webu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zrušil jsem admina. Byly to statické stránky na „tajné“ adrese, s vygenerovanými informacemi o tom, co vše robot uložil nebo vyhodil. V patičce bylo napsáno, že pokud nejste administrátor stránek, tak máte odejít pryč :D Zabezpečení, které doteď stačilo. Do budoucna místo toho plánuji využít nějak &lt;a href="https://datasette.io/"&gt;Datasette&lt;/a&gt; pro nahlížení do produkční databáze a zároveň si posílat nějaké statistiky přímo na Discord.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pracoval jsem na tom, abych dokázal efektivně určovat lokaci k nabídkám práce. To už v původním robotovi bylo, ale teď jsem to musel trochu předělat. Velké zlepšení je, že lokaci stahuji jen k nabídkám, u kterých ji potom fakt využiju.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zjistil jsem, že když bylo umístění pracovní nabídky „Czechia“, „Česko“, apod., tak si s tím můj geocoding neporadil a udělal mi z toho Číhošť v Jihlavském kraji. To by vysvětlovalo, proč bylo v Číhošti tolik nabídek. Opravil jsem to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Povedlo se mi dotáhnout překopávání robota až k tomu, že jsem konečně dokázal nabídky zobrazit i na webu. To byl skvělý pocit, po měsících koukání do terminálu konečně vidět ta data i v HTML.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pracoval jsem na tom, abych dokázal efektivně stahovat loga k nabídkám práce. To už v původním robotovi bylo, ale teď jsem to celé změnil tak, aby se to dělalo jen pro těch pár nabídek, které chci fakt ten den zobrazit, a aby to bylo celé rychlé a efektivní. Myslel jsem, že na to použiju Scrapy a &lt;a href="https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/media-pipeline.html"&gt;Media Pipeline&lt;/a&gt;, ale nakonec jsem si to udělal úplně ve vlastním skriptu a funguje to perfektně. Žádná data už neukládám do EXIFu, což jsem v Media Pipeline dělat musel, abych tím cosi obešel. Smazal jsem spoustu složitostí. Skvěle do toho zapadlo i hledání faviconů, pokud logo firmy nemám k dispozici. Algoritmus, který vybírá nejvhodnější logo z různých kandidátů, na ten jsem vyloženě hrdý. Skoro jako něco z Advent of Code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zajistil jsem, aby i po všech změnách fungovalo správně API, které jsem dříve vyrobil pro Czechitas. Udělal jsem v něm ale nějaké změny v tom, jak funguje, abych měl život jednodušší. Oznámil jsem je druhé straně a vše bylo přijato jako že to je v pohodě, takže paráda.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vyhodil jsem z webu sledování počtu klikání na tlačítka na nabídkách práce přímo na JG. Čísla se posílala inzerentům v mailech. Měřilo se to přes Google Analytics eventy a myslel jsem, že to předělám na &lt;a href="https://simpleanalytics.com/junior.guru"&gt;Simple Analytics&lt;/a&gt; eventy. Jenže pak jsem na to nějak neměl náladu a řekl jsem si, že to zkusím prostě smazat a když si inzerenti nevšimnou, tak to bude prostě smazané :D Mě to chybět nebude. Běžné statistiky návštěvnosti mít budou a počty „kandidátů“ stejně ví nejlépe oni sami a ne já z toho, co pochybně naměřím JavaScriptem na webu. Díky tomuto kroku jsem mohl už definitivně z kódu smazat vše kolem Google Analytics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Posílání emailů inzerentům jsem přesunul do fáze „synchronizace“. Původně byly fáze „fetch“, kde se stahovaly data a „send“, kde se posílaly emaily. Toto už ale dávno neplatí, „fetch“ se změnilo na „sync” a dělají se tam i věci, které něco posílají, třeba do Discordu. Takže je zbytečné, aby emaily byly někde bokem. Potřeboval jsem ale zajistit, aby se nikdy neposlaly dvakrát. Takže si do txt souboru vždy uložím, kdy se poslaly naposled a dávám to do CircleCI cache, aby to přežilo mezi buildy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zatím jsem úplně odstranil monitoring toho, zda se při scrapování nebo zpracovávání inzerátů něco pokazilo. Taky jsem vrátil jen zlomek původních testů a nenapsal skoro žádné nové. Nepočítám s tím, že to dodělám, než všechny změny mergnu. Udělám to později, protože už teď bude i tento nemonitorovaný kód mít lepší výsledek, než co dělá bot na produkci teď, i kdyby v tom byly chyby. &lt;em&gt;What could go wrong.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přešel jsem od Makefile k &lt;a href="https://www.pyinvoke.org/"&gt;invoke&lt;/a&gt; a změnil jsem podle toho některé komentáře a dokumentaci. Ne že bych teda nějakou dokumentaci velmi měl.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zjistil jsem, že ačkoliv jsem vše udělal paralelní a konkurentní a na fáze a super efektivní, tak stahování nabídek práce z nejmenovaného serveru, říkejme mu třeba LI, stejně zabere strašně moc času. Prostě klidně půl hodiny, hodinu. A to proto, že to stahuju skrze nějaké náhodné proxy, jelikož rozsah IP adres, v němž se nachází moje CircleCI buildy, zřejmě apriori blokují (z domova mi to normálně funguje i bez proxy). No a s tím se nedalo nic moc dělat, než to ladit, ladit a ladit. Našel jsem jiný zdroj těch proxy (místo scrapování &lt;a href="https://free-proxy-list.net/"&gt;free-proxy-list.net&lt;/a&gt; jsem našel API na &lt;a href="https://docs.proxyscrape.com/"&gt;proxyscrape.com&lt;/a&gt;), zkoušel různé timeouty, různé strategie, různé rotování, atd. Nakonec jsem to nějak vyřešil, chybou bylo mít krátký timeout, abych roztřídil proxy, které fungují, od těch, které nefungují. Zdá se, že větší timeout je lepší, protože může trvat třeba 10-15s první připojení, ale pak už to frčí rychle. Pak stačí nějaký inteligentní algoritmus vybírání těch proxy a vypadá to, že ze 40 minut jsem na 10 minutách. To je naprosto zásadní, protože pokud bych toto nevyřešil, tak nemá smysl nového robota vůbec nasazovat, nebo se později pouštět do přidávání dalších zdrojů nabídek práce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poslední dva dny ladím různé chyby, které se postupně objevují a stojí v cestě tomu, abych to celé poslal už na produkci. Sem tam nějaký edge case, sem tam nějaká exception. Ale už mi to i celé prošlo a build byl zelený, ladím už fakt jen detaily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Žongluju ještě s přesným nastavením cache na CircleCI a toho, jak jdou věci za sebou. Třeba jsem zjistil, že když má cache stejný klíč, tak se nepřepíše, ale zahodí, jakože už existuje. To mi udělalo čáru přes rozpočet. Ale pak jsem zjistil, že &lt;code&gt;restore_cache&lt;/code&gt; umí obnovit podle prefixu klíče, ne jen podle celého klíče, a tím jsem to zase vyřešil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jen poznámka. Celý robot je věc, která mi negeneruje žádné peníze. Ano, využívám to jako backfill inzerátů na svůj portál s nabídkami práce, kde firmy inzerují za peníze, tzn. je tam pak třeba 5 placených inzerátů a 30 stažených odjinud, aby to nevypadalo blbě.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenže ty placené inzeráty mě živí teď minimálně, reálně je to 2-5 % mých příjmů. Takže kvůli tomu to fakt nedělám. A i kdyby, existuje samozřejmě deset jiných zdrojů nabídek práce než LI, kde je stáhnu prakticky bez práce. Nemusel bych ani řešit žádné velké objemy nabídek, prostě bych jich stáhl pár, třeba deset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dělám to celé ze stejného důvodu, jako třeba příručku. Má to být služba juniorům. Chci, aby měli místo, kam můžou jít a budou vědět, že tam jsou pouze juniorní nabídky práce, ze všech běžných zdrojů, kde by je stejně hledali. To je můj primární cíl do budoucna. Služba juniorům, usnadnit jim hledání práce. Zároveň se nabídky propisují nejen na web, ale i do klubu, takže se dá říct, že je ten robot součástí produktu „klub”, nabídky tam lidem chodí díky tomu až pod nos, což dělá z klubu zas o něco užitečnější místo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takže byť moje konání vypadá nesmyslně, příliš mnoho práce pro nic, tak bych chtěl upozornit, že totéž se dá říct o příručce (příliš pracného psaní pro nic), ale holt to jsou vlastně ty hlavní věci, které chci tvořit, dát světu zdarma k dispozici, a které mi má pomáhat klub financovat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pyvec"&gt;Pyvec&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#pyvec" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Výbor &lt;a href="https://pyvec.org/"&gt;Pyvce&lt;/a&gt; dosluhuje. 4 lidi z 5 (kromě mě) tu práci dělají 10 let. Já 5 let. Tak tak jsme to dokázali doklepat do voleb, v posledních týdnech nám upřímně dělalo problém se i sejít na videohovoru a připravit samotné volby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nakonec nás zahchránili samotní členové na Členské schůzi. Vzali si různé úkoly, které nám pomohly volby uspořádat. Bylo to strašně super najednou vidět všechny aktivně něco dělat a spolupracovat. Taky Pyvec Slack zase po dlouhých covidových měsících (rocích?) trochu ožil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Před volbami jsem oznámil, že budu do příštího výboru kandidovat jen pokud dostanu aspoň tři nominace, což se následně i stalo. Sepsal jsem i své nominace pro lidi, kteří si myslím, že jsou do výboru vhodní. Nakonec budeme volit 5 lidí z 6 kandidátů! Takže to bude i napínavé :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Po vzoru PSF nakonec hlasujeme přes &lt;a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/"&gt;Helios&lt;/a&gt;. V současné chvíli se hlasuje, volby jsme udělali tak, aby trvaly týden a odhlasovat měl šanci opravdu každý. Jsem zvědavý, jak to dopadne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kupony-pro-studenty-z-kurzu"&gt;Kupóny pro studenty z kurzů&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#kupony-pro-studenty-z-kurzu" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Některé vzdělávací agentury mi posílají své studenty do klubu s tím, že jim proplatí první 3 měsíce členství. Ze začátku to drhlo a moc jich nechodilo, ale teď se to nějak rozjelo a už dávno jsem to měl fakturovat. A když jsem se o to pokusil, tak jsem si uvědomil, že abych mohl fakturovat, potřebuji si někde poznačit, koho jsem už vyúčtoval a koho ne a že to není v mé současné evidenci tak triviální, jak jsem myslel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Napsal jsem na support Memberful, jestli je možnost přes API vytáhnout privátní poznámku u členů, ale nejde to. Mají ovšem nějaké jiné políčko, kam jde něco uložit, bohužel k němu není zase UI, takže bych si to tam musel poznačit nějak přes to API, tedy asi přes nějaký skript. Vymýšlením řešení jsem strávil skoro celý jeden den.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No nebude to jednoduché a zatím jsem pouze napsal do agentury e-mail, že na tom dělám a jaký je přibližný stav, a že se ještě ozvu. Aby to nebylo dlouhé mlčení a pak najednou buch, velká faktura. Odložil jsem to a budu to řešit, až dořeším robota na nabídky práce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dovolena"&gt;Dovolená&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dovolena" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S kamarádem &lt;a href="https://milavotradovec.cz/"&gt;Mílou&lt;/a&gt; jsme se relativně spontánně rozhodli, že pojedeme na kole 300 km, z Prahy do &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/kozojedsky.dvur.nitkovice/"&gt;Kozojedského dvora&lt;/a&gt;, kde jsem měl svatbu a rád se tam vracím. Takové cesty jsem dřív už absolvoval v nejrůznějších podobách a délkách, ale vždy v létě. Teď to mělo být v březnu a měla být dost zima. Rozhodli jsme se pro &lt;em&gt;credit card touring&lt;/em&gt; místo stanu, ale i tak byl oříšek zabalit se tak, abychom zvládli zimu a vítr. Naši cestu jsme dokumentovali &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/300ukozojed"&gt;polotajným deníkem na Twitteru&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter jsme zvolili jako něco, kam lze psát, dávat obrázky a videa, co je veřejné a co můžeme dát kamarádům a rodině, aby věděli kde jsme. Bohužel Twitter už dnes veřejný není, což jsme si neuvědomili. Všichni si stěžovali, že po přečtení pár tweetů to po nich chtělo založit účet. Kde jsou naše staré dobré internety, na které člověk něco napsal a druhý si to mohl přečíst? :(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dovolená to byla náročná, ale jedním z účelů bylo vyčistit si hlavu. Na klasické dovolené, kde se člověk fláká, mi trvá týden, než přestanu myslet na práci. Na takovýchto náročných cestách se mi líbí, že vyčištění hlavy zabere většinou nanejvýš pár hodin prvního dne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cesta se i přes různé nesnáze povedla a v cíli jsme dokonce zahráli na kytaru lidem z Ukrajiny, kteří byli na dvoře nouzově ubytovaní, takže to bylo takové hezké. Hlavu jsem si vyčistil. Zdravotní následky snad žádné permanentní mít nebudu :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Po dovolené jsem měl 20+ notifikací na FB, 10+ na Twitteru, 20+ notifikací na LinkedIn, 80+ emailů. V klubu toho taky bylo dost, ale nebylo to nakonec tak hrozné, protože ještě trval útlum aktivity po tom, co začala válka na Ukrajině. Všechno jsem nějak dohnal více méně za jeden den, takže se to dalo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horší to bylo s fyzickým vyčerpáním, které mi zabránilo po příjezdu do Prahy doplazit se na první &lt;a href="https://pyvo.cz/"&gt;pražské Pyvo&lt;/a&gt;, které se po dlouhé době konalo živě a ne online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Účastnil jsem se mezikomunitního sdílení, probírali jsme mentoring. Přínosné!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oslovil jsem svého účetního, že bychom měli udělat daňové přiznání. Během několika týdnů jsem mu postupně posílal různé podklady. Dnes mi poslal hotové přiznání do mailu, ale ještě jsem to neodevzdal. Přidal jsem do &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;grafu výdajů&lt;/a&gt; barvičku na účetnictví, ať mám trochu přehled, kolik mě vlastně relativně k ostatním věcem externí zpracovávání daní stojí. Dělat se mi to ale fakt nechce, takže je to spíš orientační, outsourcoval bych to za každou cenu :D&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zřídil jsem si datovou schránku, abych mohl daňové přiznání poslat digitálně. Doteď jsem datovku neměl a přiznání posílal jako papír v obálce, ale začíná to být těžší, než datovku mít a papíry neposílat. Díky MojeID mám jakou si tu eIdentitu občana, nebo jak se to jmenuje, takže to bylo na dva kliky, což mě překvapilo. Myslel jsem, že budu muset jít na poštu. Dostal jsem radu, že jako OSVČ vše vyřídím i pouze s osobní datovkou, tak jsem si zřídil jen tu a tu podnikatelskou ne. První dojmy z datovky jsou spíš pozitivní. Možná jsem nemusel být takový zpátečník tak dlouho.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vydal jsem nový díl podcastu. Pája jej nahrála včas, ale já byl na dovolené, tak to vyšlo později, než to vyjít mělo. Svět se nezbořil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Propojil jsem Páju s dalším hostem do podcastu. Funguje nám to skvěle. Pája nadhodí téma nebo charakteristiku někoho, koho by si ráda pozvala. Já pak sáhnu do paměti a do své široké sítě kontaktů a vytáhnu nějaké vhodné kandidáty, ze kterých si vybere. Nebo přijde i s konkrétním jménem a já je můžu aspoň propojit, protože toho člověka znám a hned je vše jednodušší :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domlouval jsem další přednášky v klubu, které přijdou po delší pauze. Jedna by měla být o práci na dálku, druhá o Next.js. Poprvé se stane, že se zopakuje speaker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Na MDŽ jsem hejtil &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/honzajavorek/status/1501136417723928582"&gt;na Twitteru&lt;/a&gt; i &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/967870373283278/posts/7058376260899295/"&gt;na Facebooku&lt;/a&gt; fakt, že je v Česku nejmenší procento žen v IT vůbec v Evropě.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domlouval jsem si call s firmou, která projevila zájem o firemní členství v klubu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vyšly se mnou hned dva podcasty, kde jsem byl hostem. &lt;a href="https://rozbiteprasatko.cz/"&gt;Rozbité prasátko&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://www.programhrovani.cz/"&gt;ProgramHRování&lt;/a&gt;. Zatím jsem ani jedno nestihl pořádně zpropagovat na svých sociálních sítích.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Přidal jsem na web nahoru lištu, která poukazuje lidi na web &lt;a href="https://www.stojimezaukrajinou.cz"&gt;stojimezaukrajinou.cz&lt;/a&gt; od Česko.Digital. Není to nic světoborného, ale třeba to někdo uvidí, třeba na to klikne a třeba díky tomu někomu pomůže. Barvy jsem na ukrajinské změnit nemohl, protože JG už žluté a modré dávno je :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Řešil jsem různé náhodné problémy s členstvím, tu něco s kartou, tam nějaký dotaz ohledně placení a tak. Zase se mě někdo ptal, jestli může za klub platit i jinak, než kartou. Nemůže. Musím to dát už do FAQ, ať to nekopíruju a nesepisuju pořád dokola.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Připojil jsem se na první sraz dobrovolníků nové komunity pro &lt;em&gt;technical writers&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.twguild.cz/"&gt;TWguild&lt;/a&gt;. Dávali jsme si vědět, jak se můžeme vzájemně podpořit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dostal se ke mě kontakt na kluka, který je v ideálním kandidátem na stipendium, jež jsme chtěli už dlouho rozjet s Mews. Dokopal jsem se tedy konečně k tomu, abych připravil formulář na žádost o stipendium a dal ho na třetí tlačítko dole na &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/club/"&gt;stránce klubu&lt;/a&gt;. Nehledě na formulář jsem si s klukem a jeho tátou zavolal a ještě si to musím nechat potvrdit z Mews, ale myslím, že je podpoříme. Kromě kluka už to vyplnili další dva lidi, které budu muset nějak ještě vyhodnotit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chtěl jsem ten videohovor udělat klukovi jednoduchý, tak jsem svolil k použití MS Teams, které má ve škole. Stejně s tím občas chtějí volat i některé firmy, tak jsem si říkal, že si v tom udělám pořádek. No řeknu vám…! Už dlouho jsem takhle nenadával. To je tak strašná aplikace. A Microsoft mi udělal účet ze Skypu a ještě z čehosi. Prostě udělat si v těch účtech pořádek a zalogovat se do těch Teamsů a nepřijít u toho o nervy, to bylo fakt něco. Hodina života. Pak že musím mít nastavený telefon. Ale z MS Teams aplikace mi to neposlalo kód. Musel jsem jít na web a nechat si to poslat tam. A takové… No ještě teď z toho teču.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Měla mi po třech letech vypršet &lt;a href="https://www.cd.cz/jizdne/in-karta/default.htm"&gt;InKarta&lt;/a&gt;, tak jsem si ji koupil na další tři roky přes aplikaci Můj vlak. Překvapilo mě, že to bylo na dva kliky, Apple Pay, cink, hotovo. Dřív se muselo na nádraží pro plastovou kartičku :D&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volal jsem si s paní ze systému na evidenci dodavatelů jedné korporace, aby ověřili, že já jsem já. Zmátlo je, že neplatím DPH, nebo že neexistuje žádný jiný zaměstnanec mé firmy, který by mohl potvrdit mou existenci. Tak snad už proplatí fakturu a bude to konečně hotovo. Tihleti korporáti, to je někdy fakt za trest. Asi zavedu, že firmy level korporát budou mít ceník o 10k dražší jen z toho titulu, že vyžadují zbytečnou byrokracii a komunikaci.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Syn partnerky bratrance mé ženy potřeboval doučit HTML do školy, tak jsem ho přidal do klubu. Jsem zvědav, jestli to bude efektivní pomoc, nebo to bude k ničemu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Procházel jsem pravidelně klub, vítal nové členy, odpovídal na věci. Prošel jsem v klubu jedno CVčko, ohodnotil nějaké výrobky…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Možná budu přednášet na příštím &lt;a href="https://pyvo.cz/"&gt;pražském Pyvu&lt;/a&gt; a možná tam bude i Pája s lightning talkem o podcastu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nastříhal jsem verzi přednášky s Nelou o duševním zdraví, kterou budeme chtít uveřejnit na web a poslal to Nele na kontrolu. iMovie FTW, vždycky si připadám jak Spielberg u toho.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;S dvěma firmami nejspíš brzo doklepneme partnerství a vyměňuji si s nimi tedy dost mailů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opravil jsem skript, který lidem v klubu přiděluje role. Měl jsem na jednom místě špatné slovo, spouštěl se ve skutečnosti úplně jiný skript (naštěstí zrovna nějaký neškodný).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knihovna &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/py-cord/"&gt;py-cord&lt;/a&gt; začala vydávat už nějaké pre-relase verze, tak jsem přešel z instalace z gitu na instalaci z PyPI. Pak jsem si dokonce všiml, že se snad obnovil i vývoj na původním &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/"&gt;discord.py&lt;/a&gt;, ale to jsem nějak nestihl zatím prozkoumat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Povedlo se mi značně zrychlit začátek buildu na CI díky tomu, že jsem nastavil git clone na shallow clone. Pomohla mi tato &lt;a href="https://discuss.circleci.com/t/checkout-is-taking-way-too-long/39787/2"&gt;diskuze&lt;/a&gt; a využil jsem &lt;a href="https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/guitarrapc/git-shallow-clone"&gt;tento CircleCI Orb&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mergoval jsem spoustu PR s upgrady knihoven na Pyvec repozitářích od &lt;a href="https://github.com/features/security"&gt;dependabota&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sekalo se mi VS Code a už jsem toho měl plné zuby, tak jsem hledal, jak to můžu zrychlit. Našel jsem &lt;a href="https://mikebifulco.com/posts/make-vs-code-load-faster-mac-apple-silicon"&gt;tenhle článek&lt;/a&gt; a zjistil, že z nějakého důvodu nemám verzi VS Code pro M1, ale Inteláckou. Tak jsem to přeinstaloval, updatoval systém, restartoval. A už dobrý.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pár firem inzerovalo nabídky práce přímo na JG, takže jsem díky tomu poslal pár faktur.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flákal jsem dost sociální sítě, protože jsem na ně neměl moc náladu (válka, dovolená). Párkrát se mi ale něco postnout povedlo: oznámení o ukrajinské liště na webu, spolupráce s &lt;a href="https://jetveo.io/cs/blog/articles/jakub-interview"&gt;Jetveo&lt;/a&gt;, nový díl &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/podcast/"&gt;JG podcastu&lt;/a&gt; nebo o tom, že o podcastu napsali v tištěném časopise Computer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Podepsal jsem smlouvu se Seznamem, aby mohli dát náš podcast na &lt;a href="https://podcasty.cz/"&gt;podcasty.cz&lt;/a&gt;. Zatím to tam myslím ale není.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 25 dní od 1.3. do 25.3. jsem při procházkách nachodil 40 km, na túrách nachodil 10 km, ujel na kole 370 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 63 hodin a zdolal při tom 420 kilometrů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aktuální finanční výsledky, návštěvnost a další čísla k JG &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;mám přímo na webu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tři věci, které bych chtěl zvládnout udělat příště:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dokončit bota, který stahuje a třídí pracovní nabídky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Řešit lidi, kteří žádají o stipendium.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Podat daňové přiznání.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pokud byste čistě náhodou měli dojem, že jste oproti mě za uplynulý týden vůbec nic nestihli, tak mám pro vás skvělou zprávu! V klidu se na ten dojem &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/neni-to-zavod/"&gt;můžete vykašlat&lt;/a&gt;. Není zač!&lt;/p&gt;

Aspoň novináři a média by nemuseli „posílat dál“ úplně cokoliv jako zaručenou věc…&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;img alt="Poznámky" src="https://honzajavorek.cz/images/jan-kahanek-g3O5ZtRk2E4-unsplash.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img rounded"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figure-caption"&gt;
Fotka od &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/@honza_kahanek"&gt;Honzy Kahánka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Týden to byl hektický a mám z něj pocit, že jsem vlastně nic udělat nezvládl. Jak jsem psal minule, doma jsme se dohodli, že když bude večer přednáška v klubu, nebudu pracovat ráno. To jsem dodržel a zrovna byla akce v klubu v úterý i středu. Oba dny jsem ale po obědě, než se akce konala, nedokázal příliš nastartovat produktivitu a mám dojem, že jsem toho reálně zas tolik udělat nezvládl. Je otázka, zda tento formát bude fungovat do budoucna nějak lépe. Teď bylo všeho nějak moc, tak si dávám pauzu i od akcí v klubu, další bude až téměř za měsíc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V druhé půlce týdne, kdy jsem si myslel, že tedy „už konečně něco udělám“, najel Putin tankama na Ukrajinu a od té doby akorát obsesivně čtu Twitter a &lt;a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/valka-ukrajina-rusko-online"&gt;online zpravodajství na Rozhlasu&lt;/a&gt;. S koncem týdne jsem nebyl schopný ani číst klub, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dorrismccomics/status/797088518354898944"&gt;všechno šlo nějak stranou&lt;/a&gt;. Až dnes, v pondělí, jsem se dokázal trochu vrátit ke svým povinnostem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="prednaska-o-dusevnim-zdravi"&gt;Přednáška o duševním zdraví&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#prednaska-o-dusevnim-zdravi" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nelaprovazi.cz/"&gt;Nela Slezáková&lt;/a&gt; měla v klubu přednášku o duševním zdraví během změny kariéry. Myslím, že to proběhlo skvěle. Využili jsme opět trik se „zrcadlem“, abychom obešli limit na videohovory na Discordu. A bylo to potřeba, nakonec přišlo víc než 25 lidí!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malý zásek nastal v tom, že jsem sice kvůli triku se „zrcadlem“ upravil hlasové kanály na Discordu pro konání přednášek a udělal na to dedikovaný kanál, ale nezměnil jsem podle toho bota. Ten při oznámení přednášky lidi směroval do původního kanálu. Založil pro původní kanál i Discord Scheduled Event a já jej na začátku přednášky odstartoval (všem přihlášeným lidem přijde notifikace a mohou na jeden klik jít do vybrané hlasového kanálu). Takže pokud lidé šli nejintuitivnější cestou a následovali bota a Discord, skončili ve špatném kanálu. Chvíli tam hlídkoval Dan a lidem říkal, ať se přesunou, dělal „vyhazovače“. Pak jsme zjistili, že jako moderátoři můžeme lidi rovnou ručně přesouvat. Bohužel ve Scheduled Eventu už to nešlo změnit, protože už byl odstartovaný. Zase kdybych jej zrušil, tak ztratím ty přihlášené lidi, kterým přišla notifikace. No trochu chaos, ale průběh přednášky to nenarušilo, zvládli jsme lidi posílat na správné místo. A zase jsme se naučili nové věci. Třeba že jde lidi přesouvat mezi hlasovými kanály i jen tažením myši. Někdy není špatné, že Discord vznikl pro náctileté hráče počítačových her :D Bota jsem po přednášce opravil, aby vše dělal pro nově vzniklý kanál dedikovaný na přednášky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blbé taky je, že OBS, kterým přednášku nahrávám, Discord, nebo internet, prostě něco po cestě nějak nestíhá obraz a v záznamu je člověk ze zrcadla hodně sekaný. Nevím, jestli to tak bylo naživo, ale myslím, že ne. Musel bych na to dávat vyloženě pozor, ale na tom záznamu se to seká tak moc, že bych si toho asi všiml.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nela tedy přetočila aspoň úvod přednášky, který byl s kamerou. Nahodil jsem to do iMovie a nastříhal. Vůbec tomu nerozumím, ale bylo to fakt jednoduché, jen jsem tam natáhl tři věci myší a připadal jsem si jak Spielberg, hned tam byly přechody a dokonce proužek s nějakým textem, apod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stříhat tímhle způsobem jiné záznamy ale neplánuji. Tento záznam má výjimku, protože ho s Nelou plánujeme uveřejnit úplně a dát dokonce na web JG. &lt;em&gt;Stay tuned.&lt;/em&gt; Zatím je ale venku jen verze pro lidi v klubu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="predstaveni-jetveo"&gt;Představení Jetveo&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#predstaveni-jetveo" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na další den jsme naplánovali představení &lt;a href="https://jetveo.io/"&gt;Jetveo&lt;/a&gt;, o které byl v klubu zájem. Kluci z Jetveo si to pěkně připravili a připojili se v šest na Discord, ale pak dlouho nikdo nepřicházel, což bylo trochu trapné. Akorát se lidi omlouvali, že to nestíhají.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Už jsme mysleli, že to zrušíme a přesuneme na jindy, ale nakonec se skupinka asi pěti lidí nasbírala, představení jsme udělali, nakonec padly i dotazy a myslím, že to dopadlo dobře.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jetveo chce hlavně zpětnou vazbu na platformu a onboarding do ní, takže jsme udělali i záznam toho dema, členové jej mají k dispozici a uvidíme, jestli se nám pak podaří posbírat nějaký feedback, až si to zájemci pustí a třeba si i vyzkouší na platformě něco rozjet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teď ale všechno převálcoval válečný konflikt, takže uvidíme, kdy bude mít smysl se k tomu zase vrátit a lidem to třeba připomenout a feedback začít sbírat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="socialni-site"&gt;Sociální sítě&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#socialni-site" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Propagoval jsem ještě trochu na některých FB skupinách &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/podcast/"&gt;díl podcastu s yablkem&lt;/a&gt;. Ještě než začal blázinec s Ukrajinou, propagoval jsem taky &lt;a href="https://prague.wordcamp.org/"&gt;WordCamp&lt;/a&gt;, který se konal v sobotu. Od té doby jsem nic nepropagoval, protože mi to přišlo jednak mimo, jednak zbytečné. Nikoho teď nezajímá, že JG má nového sponzora. Mě se ani nechce teď takové posty psát a stejně by zapadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kdo na to má sílu, plní svoje sociální sítě tipy jak pomoci Ukrajině. Já jsem se rozhodl, že budou moje sociální sítě prostě mlčet, protože je to ta druhá nejlepší věc, kterou můžu v tuto chvíli udělat. Nemám dojem, že bych mohl sám nějak moc přišpět tím, že budu sdílet informace, přijde mi, že informace už jsou všude kolem mě dostupné a nevěřím, že mám ve svých kruzích někoho, kdo k nim přístup nemá.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Také nejsem velkým fanouškem pomáhání skrze barvičky a vlaječky, takže ač při čtení zpráv dýchám pro Ukrajinu, nemám moc chuť si někde něco přebarvovat. Ostatně, nový design JG už ve žluto-modré stejně je :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="predelavani-toho-jak-funguji-skripty"&gt;Předělávání toho, jak fungují skripty&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#predelavani-toho-jak-funguji-skripty" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokročil jsem zase trochu co se týče přepracovávání bota na stahování a třídění pracovních nabídek. Zjistil jsem, že aby mohly věci jet správně vedle sebe a za sebou na CI, v různých „množinách“, potřeboval bych už něco lepšího, než spouštět skripty přes &lt;code&gt;Makefile&lt;/code&gt; a &lt;code&gt;python -m ...&lt;/code&gt; apod. Způsob, jak to fungovalo doteď, byl jednoduchý, dřevní, občas otravný, ale zatím dostačující. Teď už ale dostačující nebyl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nejsem nadšený, že jsem musel v rámci už tak velkého předělávání věcí rozšťourat a předělat další věc. Ale součástí nového systému pro stahování nabídek práce je už přímo to, že pojedou na CI paralelně scrapery a další věci a že potom tam bude něco, co poběží až dvě tyhle paralelní věci skončí, atd. Organizovat takovou věc starým způsobem už prostě nebylo možné, resp. dalo by mi to dost práce a stejně by to byl binec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zkusil jsem tedy &lt;a href="https://www.pyinvoke.org/"&gt;Invoke&lt;/a&gt;, který jsem nikdy nepoužíval, ale už párkrát jsem na něj narazil jako na řešení, jak si v Pythonu takové věci organizovat. Chvíli mi trvalo, než jsem se naučil to používat, je to občas trochu zběsilé DSL spoléhající se implicitně na názvy proměnných apod., což je někdy na palici, ale pořád je to asi lepší, než cokoliv bych vyrobil sám.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Přesunul jsem na to všechno z &lt;code&gt;Makefile&lt;/code&gt; a zároveň si v tom začal organizovat i jednotlivé skripty z části JG, která zodpovídá za stahování dat, postování na Discord apod., které říkám „sync“ a jejíž součástí stahování a třídění nabídek práce je.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vrazil jsem do toho i pytest a to dokonce způsobem, který využije už rozjetý Python proces (import a spuštění pytestu jako knihovny) a nespouští nový subproces. Tuto optimalizaci bude možné teď provést i s dalšími věcmi, které na projektu mám, což je fajn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K tomu se mi povedlo ještě zase trochu přeházet vidlema nějaké soubory a funkce kolem měření délky trvání skriptů nebo logování.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dalsi-poznamky"&gt;Další poznámky&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#dalsi-poznamky" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domlouval jsem příští přednášku v klubu. Bude o cestování při práci a digitálním nomádství a bude zhruba za měsíc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Řešil jsem fakturu pro jednu firmu. Taky jsem řešil vyplňování formulářů do jejich evidence dodavatelů. Samozřejmě klasické problémy, jako například povinné pole pro DIČ (přitom nejsem plátcem daně), ale jsem už &lt;em&gt;battle-tested&lt;/em&gt;, takže jsem to zvládl za 30 minut (hlavně kopírováním všech údajů ze systému pro dodavatele, do kterého jsem se musel registrovat pro jinou firmu) a na maily o tom, že jsem zadal neplatný DIČ, už odpovídám skoro poslepu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memberful mají novou fičuru, &lt;a href="https://memberful.com/blog/member-referrals/"&gt;věrnostní program pro členy&lt;/a&gt;. Zajímavé, možná využiju!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V klubu se řešily startupy, mzda na inzerátech, hardware při nástupu do firmy, pracovní stoly, pohovory, duševní zdraví během sledování válečného konfliktu. Já jsem dnes ještě prošel všechno v klubu a všude odpověděl, uvítal nové lidi, zkusil trochu rozdmýchat po děsivém víkendu diskuze o juniorních tématech a jednomu juniorovi jsem dal hloubkový feedback na osobní web a CVčko.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V rámci čirého eskapismu jsem po nocích hrál &lt;a href="https://play0ad.com/"&gt;0 A.D.&lt;/a&gt;. Dal jsem si obtížnost na medium a nebyl jsem schopen počítač porazit ani na desátý pokus. Takže pak jsem přestal hrát a místo toho sledoval YouTube videa o tom, jak se to hraje, nebo jak to hraje někdo jiný. Zjistil jsem, že mě to baví skoro víc než to hraní, ale připadám si u toho divně. Pak jsem si ale uvědomil, celé sledování sportu je založeno na stejném principu (lidi baví dívat se na někoho, kdo umí sportovat lépe než oni a samotný sport vůbec nevykonávají) a hned mi bylo líp. Ale věřím, že to překonám a brzo si zase místo sledování YouTube i zahraju :D&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odnesl jsem nějaké tašky s věcmi do nejbližší sbírky pro Ukrajinu. Původně jsme se ženou vtipkovali, že darujeme svetr, který sice už dlouho nenosím, ale ke kterému mám citový vztah a proto jsem ho nikomu nedokázal jen tak dát nebo jej jinak vyřadit. Ve výsledku jsme ale doma našli snad 6 tašek užitečných věcí, které by šlo darovat. Nesli jsme to do sbírky zaměřené vyloženě na matky s dětmi, takže měli velkou radost hlavně z dětského oblečení, dudlíků, apod.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Napsal jsem daňařovi, abychom začali připravovat podklady pro daňové přiznání. Minule jsem podklady sbíral několik hodin (např. potvrzení o darech) a on z nich použil malý zlomek s tím, že už s tím to šlo na nula daní a do mínusu to jít nemůže :D Tak letos jsem pojal jinou strategii. Nastínil jsem mu čísla a co dělám a ať napíše, co si myslí, že bude mít smysl mu v podkladech dodat :D&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Během 7 dní od 22.2. do 28.2. jsem při procházkách nachodil 15 km. Celkem jsem se hýbal 8 hodin a zdolal při tom 15 kilometrů.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aktuální finanční výsledky, návštěvnost a další čísla k JG &lt;a href="https://junior.guru/open/"&gt;mám přímo na webu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tři věci, které bych chtěl zvládnout udělat příště:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pracovat dál na botovi, který stahuje a třídí pracovní nabídky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vyúčtovat studenty jedné vzdělávací agentuře, která mi je posílá do klubu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vytvořit formulář na žádost o stipendium na členství v klubu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-co-vy"&gt;A co vy?&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#a-co-vy" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokud byste čistě náhodou měli dojem, že jste oproti mě za uplynulý týden vůbec nic nestihli, tak mám pro vás skvělou zprávu! V klidu se na ten dojem &lt;a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/neni-to-zavod/"&gt;můžete vykašlat&lt;/a&gt;. Není zač!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="co-me-zaujalo"&gt;Co mě zaujalo&lt;small class="permalink"&gt;&lt;a href="#co-me-zaujalo" title="Odkaz na tento nadpis"&gt;&lt;i class="bi bi-link-45deg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Když si něco přečtu nebo poslechnu a líbí se mi to, &lt;a href="https://getpocket.com/@honzajavorek"&gt;sdílím to na Pocketu&lt;/a&gt;. Od posledních poznámek jsem sdílel toto:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://nazory.aktualne.cz/komentare/new-york-times/r~30d496ea8fe211eca9b1ac1f6b220ee8/"&gt;Pokud Biden neříká o Rusku pravdu, dozvíme se to. Putinovy lži ale nikdo nehlídá&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Komentář o tom, jak i Bílý dům může vypouštět účelové informace, ale na rozdíl od Putina pak dostane přes prsty od svobodných médií.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Není to vše, co jsem přečetl, slyšel nebo viděl, ale jen zlomek, který mě zaujal. K vygenerování tohoto seznamu jsem použil vlastní knihovnu &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/pocket-recommendations/"&gt;pocket-recommendations&lt;/a&gt;. Věci, které jsem sdílel v den psaní minulých poznámek, se opakují i v těch dalších a je to záměr, ne chyba.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category><category term="týdenní poznámky"></category><category term="junior.guru"></category></entry></feed>
